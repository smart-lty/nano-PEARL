{"question_id": 1, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN) I see signs of a revolution everywhere. I see it in the op-ed pages of the newspapers, and on the state ballots in nearly half the country. I see it in politicians who once preferred to play it safe with this explosive issue but are now willing to stake their political futures on it. I see the revolution in the eyes of sterling scientists, previously reluctant to dip a toe into this heavily stigmatized world, who are diving in head first. I see it in the new surgeon general who cites data showing just how helpful it can be. I see a revolution in the attitudes of everyday Americans. For the first time a majority, 53%, favor its legalization, with 77% supporting it for medical purposes. Support for legalization has risen 11 points in the past few years alone. In 1969, the first time Pew asked the question about legalization, only 12% of the nation was in favor. I see a revolution that is burning white hot among young people, but also shows up among the parents and grandparents in my kids' school. A police officer I met in Michigan is part of the revolution, as are the editors of the medical journal, Neurosurgery. I see it in the faces of good parents, uprooting their lives to get medicine for their children -- and in the children themselves, such as Charlotte, who went from having 300 seizures a week to just one or two a month. We know it won't consistently have such dramatic results (or any impact at all) in others, but what medicine does? I see this medical marijuana revolution in surprising places. Girl's seizures spur medical marijuana legislation in Georgia . Among my colleagues, my patients and my friends. I have even seen the revolution in my own family. A few years ago, when I told my mother I was investigating the topic for a documentary, I was met with a long pause. \"Marijuana...?\" She whispered in a half questioning, half disapproving tone. She could barely even say the word and her response filled me with self-doubt. Even as a grown man, mom can still make my cheeks turn red and shatter my confidence with a single word. But just last week she suddenly stopped mid-conversation and said, \"I am proud of you on the whole marijuana thing.\" I waited for the other shoe to drop, but it didn't. Instead, she added, \"You probably helped a lot of people who were suffering.\" I don't think we had ever had a conversation like that one. At that moment, I saw a revolution that can bring you to tears. The word revolution, comes from the Latin revolutio, to \"turn around.\" I had my own turn around a couple of years ago, and at the time it was a lonely place to hold a supportive position on medical marijuana. Hardly any government officials would agree to sit down and be interviewed on the topic. Even patients I spoke to were reluctant to share their stories. It can be tricky, I learned, to be on the right side of science but on the wrong side of ideology. When we put the first \"Weed\" documentary on television in August 2013, I didn't know if anyone would watch our yearlong investigation. Even worse, I didn't even know if they would care. Is weed legal in your state? Just two years later, in \"Weed 3,\" we are eyewitnesses to a revolution in full swing. You will ride along with us for the dawn of the first federally approved clinical study on the use of marijuana for PTSD. You will meet patients such as Sean Kiernan, an accomplished investment banker, and Amelia Taylor, a stay-at-home mom. They are the remarkable and surprising faces of this revolution -- smart, successful and suffering -- unwilling to accept the fact that commonly prescribed medications often used to treat PTSD can be worse than the underlying disorder itself. Sean Kiernan nearly died, trying to get better. You will see what weed really does to your brain, in crystal clear images. This time around, you will hear from the heads of government agencies earnestly sharing their point of view, both Democratic and Republican senators, and even the President of the United States. This is what a revolution looks like. Your medical marijuana questions answered . When \"Weed 2: Cannabis Madness\" aired in March 2014, Boston researcher Rick Doblin believed the right people were watching. Just four days later, Doblin received a letter in the mail he had been waiting on for seven years that finally provided federal approval for his marijuana study. The federal farm where Doblin would have to obtain his marijuana is on the campus of Ole Miss in Oxford, Mississippi. In anticipation of a scientific revolution, the production of research-grade marijuana there has increased 30-fold in just the past year. Make no mistake, we have plenty of evidence that the approval and support of the federal government can fast track a revolution at a faster pace than we have yet seen. It was the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases that spearheaded the research into a cure for AIDS, as well as stopping the spread of West Nile Virus. They were also responsible for the awesome task of eradicating polio and smallpox. Other successful federally backed programs include the human genome project, the BRAIN initiative and the Precision Medicine Initiative. There are no shortage of examples where the federal government has been a guardian of our public health needs, and you could argue that medical marijuana would also qualify as a worthwhile investment. 10 diseases where medical marijuana could have impact . There is now promising research into the use of marijuana that could impact tens of thousands of children and adults, including treatment for cancer, epilepsy and Alzheimer's, to name a few. With regard to pain alone, marijuana could greatly reduce the demand for narcotics and simultaneously decrease the number of accidental painkiller overdoses, which are the greatest cause of preventable death in this country. As I sat across from Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-New York) and Cory Booker (D-New Jersey), I knew something extraordinary was happening. They were reciting the story of Charlotte Figi and countless other children. They were quoting back the data we had shared from our earlier investigations. They were extolling the potential virtues of the plant, and all of that was before the interview even started. There was an impatience about them, and they seemed in a hurry to make a large dent in marijuana reform. They want marijuana to be rescheduled. They want it now. They want doctors to be able to prescribe it at VA hospitals all over the country. They want it now. They want research dollars freed up to study the plant. They want it now. They want their fellow lawmakers at the state and national level to acknowledge what most of the world, including the citizens of the United States, have known for a long time: Marijuana is a medicine, that should be studied and treated like any other medicine. And they want all of it now. I spent much of our interview challenging them. I needed to remind them that people, long before me or them, have been trying to do many of these same things for 40 years, and had been rejected every time. I reminded them that politicians have a hard time winning elections on the issue of marijuana but less difficulty losing them. I challenged them every step of the way. \"This time will be different,\" Booker confidently told me as he walked out of the room. Is marijuana as safe as -- or safer than -- alcohol? I know how easy it is do nothing because I did nothing for too long. Take a good look at the data, educate yourself and talk to the patients, who are often out of options and find their hope in the form of a simple plant. Journalists shouldn't take a position. It makes sense. Objectivity is king. But, at some point, open questions do get answered. At some point, contentious issues do get resolved. At some point, common sense prevails. So, here it is: We should legalize medical marijuana. We should do it nationally. And, we should do it now. 9 things to know about legal pot .\n"]}

And now the state's largest teacher's union is calling him out for his 'bullying' behavior. 'He's always taken a very nasty and disrespectful tone with teachers and other individuals who dare to question him at these events,' Steve Wollmer of the NJ Education Association told NJ.com. 'It's the one thing that never seems to change.' Scroll Down for Video . Not being nice: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie (left) is being called a bully for the way he interacted with a teacher (Kathy Mooney, right) at a Tuesday night town hall meeting . That sentiment doesn't ring well with Christie's ambitions to run in the Republican presidential primaries next year. Tuesday night, Christie appeared at Kenilworth Town Hall to take questions from a group of citizens, when Kathy Mooney, a high school English Teacher from Roselle Park, took the microphone. Ms Mooney, who has been a teacher for 27 years, questioned Christie's motivations behind a legal settlement with oil company ExxonMobil which could have contributed drastically to the state's pension plans for teachers. Christie settled the deal for $225million, despite the fact that the state had originally asked for $8.9billion which Mooney described as 'favoring the affluent' and 'kicking state workers under the bus'. 'I know that you could have gotten more money, on the dollar,' Mooney said. 'Do you?' a defensive Christie quickly responded. 'You do know that? Really? You know that?' Mooney started to respond, but not before being cut off by the governor. A good deal? Mooney questioned Christie's decision-making behind a $225million legal settlement. The state originally wanted $8.9billion from the oil company, and Mooney says that would have had a huge impact on pensions for public employees . 'I mean: Do you know that?' Christie continued. 'I wanna know how you know that. Because you're a teacher, and you're standing in front of students every day, conveying to them, facts - things that they need to learn. So I would like to understand your analysis of how you know that in a ten year long, court case, that you have enough detail to know.' Mooney explains that she read about the deal in the newspaper and did not attend the meeting 'to be bullied'. 'You're not being bullied, because you're asking me a question, I'm going to ask you questions back,' Christie says, as he continues to dodge the issue. 'He said, \"I'm not bullying you' as he bullied her,\"' Wollmer said of the exchange. Perhaps the reason why Wollmer and his union responded sharply to Christie's town hall meeting Tuesday night, is that he blamed the union for their role in the current pension system. 'The fact is your union, over the course of time, has asked for significantly higher benefits - more expensive benefits - that your union knew the state could not afford,' Christie said Tuesday.\n"]}

Cassey's YouTube channel, Blogilates, has over two million subscribers, so fans may have been surprised to learn that the negative comments left under the California resident\u2019s fitness videos still manage to get under her skin \u2013 and have a much greater impact on her than any of the positive messages sent to her by her fans. But though mean and critical messages may have put a dent in the 28-year-old\u2019s self-esteem, the workout pro is getting the last word with her latest video, The 'Perfect' Body, which examines just whether conforming to society's standards is the key to happiness, while highlighting some of the cruel comments she has received from viewers of her YouTube videos. Scroll down for video. Fighting back: In her new video, Pilates instructor and YouTube star Cassey Ho combats body-shamers who comment on her videos . She's only human: Seemingly full of confidence, Cassey said even she has felt bad about herself after reading nasty comments calling her 'fat' online . In a post on her Blogilates blog, Cassey said negative comments on her videos are nothing new, but the flood of nastiness has grown especially bad lately. She added that the trash-talking has even brought her to tears on more than one occasion. 'It\u2019s hard to be content with the shape of your body when people are constantly telling you how fat you are, how much weight you need to lose, how much weight you need to gain,' she wrote. 'What do people want?' Cassey goes on to explain that, through her new video, fans can see what it's like to face that kind of negativity, and watch as her own self-esteem gets 'stripped away', leaving her feeling insecure and ashamed about her appearance. Fit or fat: The slim and toned blogger says that the negativity in the comments section of her YouTube channel has become especially nasty lately, and has even made her cry . Peanut gallery problems: In the new video, Cassey picks at her body, honing in on places that commenters say she could improve upon . The video begins with Cassey posting a selfie in gym clothes, taken just after a workout. She immediately starts to read the comments, and though they start off positive, soon people are telling her she shouldn't give fitness advice because she is fat. Cassey goes on to strip down to her underwear, examining, pinching and prodding her body, using the spiteful comments to direct her to different parts of her physique that people insist need changing. And as the video goes on, she grows more unsatisfied with herself as negative comments pop up around her. So the YouTube star gets to work, manipulating her body in a simulation of real-life Photoshop. She thins her thighs, hips, and waist, makes her butt and chest bigger, and even changes the color of her eyes. Finally, she posts another selfie of her 'improved' look - achieved with the help of a body double - but she is clearly still unhappy, and she uses this feeling to try and show viewers that giving in to body-shaming will only leave you worse off. Before and after: The fitness expert's body goes under a major transformation; Cassey used a body double to achieve the final look . Moral message: Even after making her butt and chest bigger and her waist and legs smaller, Cassey still doesn't find happiness at the end of the video . No Photoshop here: The retouching in Cassey's video was meant to prove a point - she doesn't use Photoshop in the photos she posts online . It seems that her 'take that' attitude has left her detractors speechless. Readers of her blog flooded the comments section of the latest post with overwhelmingly positive feedback. 'Thank you for standing up to this struggle for girls and women everywhere,' wrote one fan. Another chimed in: 'I absolutely applaud that you are your natural, beautiful self. I think you\u2019re a wonderful inspiration for young people.' Cassey hopes viewers who relate to the video's message will share it in an effort to battle body shaming and cyber bullying.\n"]}

'I am a fighter at heart and I am not going to throw away 20 years of dedication because of bureaucracy.' Cook, who fought for Team GB at Beijing 2008, felt he was overlooked for London 2012 - when Lutalo Muhammad, who was selected instead, won bronze - because he decided to quit the British programme in 2011. Cook is aggrieved at being overlooked in favour of Lutalo Muhammad, who won bronze at London 2012 . GB Taekwondo has always denied this, but Cook has refused to compete under the British flag since May 2012 and has fought for the Isle of Man since early 2013. 'It has been an amazing couple of years full of memories, and I would have loved to continue competing under the Isle of Man banner,' Cook said. 'Unfortunately that was never going to be possible as it was made clear to me in May of last year, after winning the European Championships for the third consecutive time, that it would not be possible for me to be selected for Team GB, regardless of my world ranking or performances. Cook competes against Mauro Sarmiento at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 . 'Having received no funding or support from the GB system and financing myself since June 2011, this was not a situation that was acceptable to me and I did not want to put myself, family, friends, supporters or sport through the same situation we were forced to endure at the London 2012 Olympic Games.' Cook hopes to represent Moldova for the first time at the inaugural Baku European Games in June having served the mandatory three-year period since representing a previous country.

The Arsenal manager will have a heart-to-heart chat with the forward ahead of Saturday\u2019s crunch top-four clash against Liverpool. Walcott was hauled off after 55 minutes of England\u2019s 1-1 draw in Italy on Tuesday night. Theo Walcott struggled for England and Arsene Wenger admits he is concerned by the winger's confidence . Walcott was replaced by Ross Barkley after just 55 minutes of England's 1-1 draw against Italy on Tuesday . 2 -\u00a0Premier League goals for Walcott this season - his average haul per season during his time at Arsenal is 5.6. It was the latest disappointment in a difficult season for the 26-year-old, who has struggled for game time since returning from a long-term lay-off due to a serious knee injury. With Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain out of Liverpool\u2019s visit due to a hamstring strain, and Danny Welbeck a major doubt after sustaining a knee problem on international duty, Walcott could start on Saturday. But Wenger said: \u2018Yes, I\u2019m worried about Theo\u2019s confidence. He\u2019s sensitive and I\u2019m a bit concerned about the damage that game can have on his mind. Walcott could face Liverpool on Saturday with Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain injured and Danny Welbeck a doubt . \u2018He\u2019s not completely there yet (after the injury). But being exposed like that, people have a harsh judgement on him that is not deserved because he does well. \u2018At the moment he is frustrated, but that is normal. I will speak with him, but I think he is strong enough. \u2018I will see what state of mind he is in. We always have a word, if it is a positive experience or a negative experience, you ask \u201chow did it go?\u201d. We always speak about the last game. \u2018He is not fragile mentally, he is strong mentally but he is disappointed because when you come back from an injury you always think you are ready. \u2018He needs patience. He is at the moment not in his best mood. \u2018He has big confidence in himself and he has gone through some difficult periods in his life and he has always come out with strength.\u2019 Arsenal boss Wenger says he will speak with Walcott but believes the Gunners winger is 'strong enough' Walcott found himself playing in the No 10 role for England in Turin \u2014 a role he is not accustomed to. And Wenger admitted he was surprised to see the pacy forward in such an unfamiliar position. \u2018Have I ever seen him play No 10 in training or anything? No,\u2019 said Wenger. \u2018Theo\u2019s strength is the quality of his movements, he wants to go to get on the end of things. He\u2019s not a guy who provides. \u2018I don\u2019t think it was the intention of Roy Hodgson to play him there. It\u2019s maybe because Wayne Rooney took the initiative during the game to play higher up and tell Theo to drop back. \u2018I didn\u2019t see Roy Hodgson in the game stand up to say \u201cWalcott, you come and play in midfield and Rooney you go up front\u201d. That\u2019s an initiative they took on the pitch.\u2019 Walcott aims a shot at goal during England's friendly against Italy at the Juventus Stadium in Turin . Walcott was starting his first international game in 18 months having injured his cruciate ligaments . Meanwhile, Wenger insists there are fundamental flaws in FA chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s proposal to increase the number of required homegrown players in Premier League squads to 12. Dyke believes increasing the number of British players in squads will help contribute to a more successful England team. But Wenger said: \u2018I believe we are in a top level competition and you earn your right through the quality of your performance rather than your place of birth. \u2018Secondly, I\u2019m happy to, and would like to contribute to the quality of the English national team, but you have two questions you can raise before that. \u2018First of all between 1966 and 1996 there were no foreign players in England and it didn\u2019t improve too much the performances of the national team. \u2018Secondly, if between the ages of 16 and 21 the England youth teams win every single competition in Europe then there is something we have to do because they are not getting their chance at the top level. Wenger believes there are flaws in FA Chairman Greg Dyke\u2019s proposal to increase the homegrown quota . \u2018That is not the case, on the contrary. I think between 16 and 21 the English youth teams, until now, have not performed. So that\u2019s the heart of the problem. \u2018Let\u2019s get better at that level, then if there is a problem integrating these players in the top teams, we have to do something about it. \u2018I think today you have to be very brave to integrate young players in the top teams because the pressure is very high. I still believe when they are good enough, they play. \u2018You speak about Raheem Sterling and Harry Kane. Nobody stops the quality, no matter where they are from. So let\u2019s focus on that first.\u2019\n"]}

But what does it mean to be English? From the Romans, Saxons and Normans many hundreds of years ago to those from Africa, the Indian sub-continent and the Philippines today, England has always been shaped by migration. To mark St George\u2019s Day today, with a little help from WorldRemit, FEMAIL reveals the seemingly very English things that have actually been brought to England by people from abroad - and you may be surprised by the origins of your favourite things. Scroll down for video . Fish and chips has become a \u00a0British institution, as well as a national money-spinner, but it is actually believed to be partly Portuguese and partly Belgian . FISH AND CHIPS . They're a British institution as well as a national money-spinner, but how much do we really know about fish and chips? For most of us, the classic combination of battered fish and chipped potatoes deep-fried in beef fat or vegetable oil is as English as the cup of tea that washes it down. But just as tea originates in India or China, fish and chips is partly Portuguese and partly Belgian. The British can take credit for uniting these two Continental imports and creating a coupling that is loved the world over. One hundred and fifty years ago, in 1860, on the streets of the East End of London, 13-year-old Jewish boy called Joseph Malin had the bright idea of combining fried fish with chips. Joseph's family were rug weavers. To increase the family income they had begun frying chips in a downstairs room of their house. It was Joseph's idea to combine the chips - at that point a novelty in London - with fish from a nearby fried fish shop. Fried fish already had a long history in London. In a letter written at the end of the 18th Century, future American President Thomas Jefferson described eating 'fried fish in the Jewish fashion' on a visit to the capital. Battered fried fish had first arrived in London 200 years earlier with Jewish refugees from Portugal and Spain. They brought with them a way of cooking fish that would eventually become as British as Sherlock Holmes. The actual origins of polo are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia and was introduced to Brits by\u00a0locals in the Indian state of Assam . By the 1830s, the imported novelty had established itself firmly as a favourite among London's poor. It was tasty, cheap and filling and could be eaten hot or cold. In 1846, a Jewish cookbook published in London included a recipe for fried fish. Eight years later, A Shilling Cookery For The People by French chef Alexis Soyer contained the first printed recipe for 'fried cooked potatoes'. The seal of respectability came when Victorian cook Eliza Acton, the forerunner of Mrs Beeton, suggested eating fried fish with vinegar to sweeten the taste. No one knows exactly how and where chips first originated. The most popular story credits a poor Belgian housewife from the Meuse Valley with their invention. In the winter of 1680, the river froze. Unable to get hold of any fish for her family, she cut potatoes into fish shapes and fried them instead. POLO . Is anything more English than rubbing shoulders with the high-rollers at a polo match at the height of summer? The actual origins of the game are unclear but historians are convinced it originated in  Persia or amongst the Iranian tribes of Central Asia. The first-ever recorded polo tournament was way back in 600BC when the Turkomans beat the Persians in a match. The game of polo spread quickly across the eastern world and became popular among Indians, who were introduced to the sport by the early Mohammedan invaders in the 13th century. Did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Yet English plantation owners actually learned polo from locals in the Indian state of Assam in the 19th century. Later popularised by royalty, it became the sport of wealthy Englishmen. TEA . We all know the English love a good cuppa. A lot of people know that tea was first grown in China, which was then taken to India by the British. But did you know that the tea bag was accidentally invented by a New York tea merchant? Invented by tea merchant Thomas Sullivan in New York City in June 1908, they can now be found in virtually every one of Britain's  homes. But if it wasn't for a handful of confused Americans, the tea bag may never have made it into our cups at all. They came about only after Mr Sullivan, in an attempt to cut costs, sent samples of tea leaves to potential customers in small silk pouch-like purses. Unsure quite what to do with the strange little bag, the Americans dunked it into a cup of hot water. And so was born the tea bag. After complaints that the mesh on the silk was too fine, Mr Sullivan developed sachets made of gauze - a method which was instrumental in today's tea bag design. But it was not until 1953, when British tea producer Tetley spotted the commercial potential of the bag, that it began to take off here. The firm now sells around 200million tea bags every week. PUBS . Long have the British population relished a pint in the local pub, but their creation is all thanks to the arrival of the Romans almost two thousand years ago. When they created the Roman road network, they opened little inns where a passer-by could enjoy a refreshing beverage en route to their destination. Originally called Tabernae, they began selling food and wine as well as ale. After the departure of the Romans, Alehouses began opening up all over the country. Saint George himself is thought to have been born in Syria during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD . ST GEORGE . Believe it or not, even Saint George himself is thought to have been born abroad\u00a0during the late third century between about 275 AD and 285 AD. Although historians have argued the Roman soldier's place of birth for over a century, it is believed that Saint George was born to a Greek Christian noble family in Syria. ENIGMA CODE . To many, the name Bletchley Park is synonymous with code-breaking glory by the British during World War Two. After all, it was there that Englishman Alan Turing and his team of mathematicians cracked the ciphers of the Nazis' Enigma machine - a feat credited with shortening the war by two years - and one depicted in award-winning movie The Imitation Game starring Keira Knightley and Benedict Cumberbatch. But in 2012, the Polish Government launched a campaign to highlight the important - and overlooked - role played by its nation in solving the Enigma code. Poles claim that Polish code breakers in Warsaw were the first ones to break Germany\u2019s Enigma code by understanding the mathematics, left.\u00a0People from Liverpool, like the Rooneys, right, are often called 'Scousers', which is short for \u2018Lobscouse\u2019, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port . In 1932, a group of cryptologists from the Polish Cipher Bureau - Marian Rejewski, Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk Zygalski - discovered three ways of deciphering Enigma readings. Seven years later, just before war broke out, the Poles handed over their knowledge of the Enigma codes, as well as Polish-built replicas of the machines, to British and French Intelligence officers near Warsaw. SCOUSERS . People from Liverpool are often called \u2018Scousers\u2019. The name is short for \u2018Lobscouse\u2019, which was a Scandinavian stew eaten by the sailors who visited the port. Local families adopted the dish, and the name stuck.\n"]}

Duli Hembrom wrote to the principal of\u00a0Milan Mithi Uchha Vidyalaya after failing to convince her parents to call off the wedding, which is due to take place in two days. She wrote: 'I do not want to get married, I took an oath at the time of admission that I will not get married before I turn 18.' She added that she wanted the teacher to stop the marriage 'whichever way possible', the India Times\u00a0reported. It is thought the 'oath' Duli refers to is the school's promise she had to make when she started, but exactly what it included is not known. Her father Lachhu, who lives in Gudibanda with Duli's mother, said child marriage was a common phenomenon in their society. He told the Hindustan Times\u00a0that it was difficult to find a suitable match for a grown-up girl. The Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed in India during British rule in 1929, specified that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. But the country has the second highest number of child marriages, according to a UN report. Nearly 52 per cent of girls are married before reaching 18 years old, Indian records show. Between 2011 and 2020 more than 140 million girls will become child brides globally, analysts estimate.

Above, women and girls sit waiting to be married in a mass wedding ceremony in India . Despite numerous campaigns from many of the world's largest charities and NGOs, the issue of child brides remains a global concern. In 2013 there were around 57.5 million child brides across the world, 40 per cent of which married in India. This is despite the Child Marriage Restraint Act, passed  during British rule in 1929, specifying that a girl must be 18 and a boy 21 before they can wed. Meanwhile, in Africa, 42 per cent of girls were married before turning 18 compared to 29 per cent in Latin America and the Caribbean. The number of child brides is estimated to rise to 140 million by 2020 if current trends continue, 18.5 million of which will be under 15 years old, analysts warn. Statistics show that girls living in poor households are almost twice as likely to marry before 18 than girls in higher income households. And girls younger than 15 are also five times more likely to die in childbirth than women in their 20s.

Photographs which show the men and woman rushing towards those crushed in the tragedy have been released, with investigators urging anyone who recognises them to come forward. They form part of an ongoing Home Office inquiry aiming to establish whether any individual or organisation was to blame for the disaster which claimed the lives of 96 Liverpool fans. Issued on behalf of the Coroner Sir John Goldring, the people in the photographs may be able to tell victims' families' more about how they died, officials said. Investigators have released these images of football fans who were pictured carrying the wounded on stretchers and tending to others at the 1989 Hillsborough disaster . Police say the 'unusual' appeal \u00a0is necessary as those photographed may be able to answer questions of the victims' families . 'It is important to stress that we believe these people can help the Coroner\u2019s inquest process,' said Assistant Commissioner Jon Stoddart of Operation Resolve, the police force set up to look into the disaster. 'I know these pictures are 26 years old but if anyone does recognise the people we need to speak to then I would urge them to get in touch immediately. 'There are still many questions that the families of the 96 have and we believe that these people may be able to provide answers to some of those questions.' Ninety-six people died at the disaster after Liverpool fans in one section of the football grounds became crushed. Previous inquests which recorded conclusions of accidental death were thrown out at the High Court in 2012 after years of campaigning by the families of those killed.

{"question_id": 12, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Sunday's announcement that Corinthian Colleges Inc. would shut down all of its remaining 28 campuses is a positive development in a long struggle to hold for-profit colleges accountable. Corinthian, which once enrolled more than 70,000 students, is one of the worst of the \"predator colleges\" -- schools that offer dubious degrees, saddle students with high amounts of debt and gobble up tens of billions of dollars in federal money every year. Many of these schools are for-profit career colleges that operate mostly online. It's no wonder that Corinthian is doing this after the U.S. Department of Education curtailed its access to federal student aid last summer. There are about 1.3 million students enrolled in for-profit colleges, many of which have questionable track records, and their students need help transitioning into legitimate postsecondary schools. With Uncle Sam's student loan debt sheet topping $1 trillion, we literally can't afford to continue funding for-profit colleges -- which reportedly get 86% of their funding from federal student loan money. For those not familiar with the for-profit college fiasco, here's the whole story in one telling statistic: While for-profit colleges enroll only 13% of the nation's college students, such colleges account for nearly half of all student loan defaults, according to Department of Education statistics. For comparison's sake, the default rate of for-profit college students is worse than the default rate of the worst subprime borrowers during the financial crisis. How do these colleges operate? It's deviously simple: Convince low-income students into borrowing tens of thousands of dollars through easy federal student loans, keep costs low through online classes and part-time professors, and watch the money roll in. The aggressive tactics of these colleges boggle the mind. Recruiters are told to make 100 phone calls and leave 100 messages a day, according to a ProPublica investigation. I can personally attest to the aggressive tactics. My phone number was accidentally placed on a call list for a for-profit college recently, and I received so many calls per day that I had to ask my wireless carrier to block the phone number. Stopping the exploitation of students isn't easy. The for-profit college business is a multibillion-dollar industry. The CEOs of these companies make millions of dollars a year, employ an army of lobbyists and donate money to both political parties. But the past two months brought a new twist to the crisis. Hundreds of graduates of the now-defunct Corinthian joined a \"debt strike,\" publicly declaring their refusal to pay back their loans. In response, Education Department Secretary Arne Duncan signaled a willingness to forgive loans of Corinthian graduates who have crushing debt and no job prospects. Now that Corinthian is finally shutting down, we must finish the job. The remaining for-profit colleges should be closed. Any student not gainfully employed or transferred to a reputable college within three years should be considered a victim, and their debts should be forgiven. Yes, \"victim\" is the right word. If these degrees actually helped people get jobs, we should be celebrating them. But according to a jaw-dropping report by the Education Department, the average graduate of an online for-profit college makes less than a high school dropout. Not the equivalent of a high school dropout. Less than a high school dropout. The real-life misery caused by predatory colleges is painful to hear about. One Corinthian graduate has $37,000 in debt for his computer science degree, but he can't even get a job at Best Buy, according to Slate. Another graduate, $33,000 in debt, has a medical assisting degree, but she gave up on finding employment in her field. She waits tables now, The Chronicle of Higher Education says. I can already hear your next question. If for-profit colleges are this terrible, are they at least cheaper? No. In fact, their cost is reportedly around 60% higher than a comparable degree from a public college. What's even more frustrating is that we've known about the shenanigans of these predator colleges for years. A 2011 report by the Government Accountability Office found widespread rule breaking by the largest for-profit colleges -- everything from accepting fictitious high-school diplomas to encouraging plagiarism and cheating. In one example, an undercover federal investigator posing as a student was told by a professor, \"It's not hard to get a 100% on the second try; just jot down the correct answers and take the quiz again,\" according to The New York Times. In 2013, Career Education Corp. paid $10 million to settle charges by the state of New York regarding phony job-placement claims. All told, no fewer than 36 state attorneys general were investigating for-profit colleges in 2014. After selling off 95 of its campuses last year, Corinthian said on Sunday that it tried unsuccessfully to sell the remaining 28 campuses, blaming the failure on \"federal and state regulators seeking to impose financial penalties and conditions\" on potential buyers. You can't hide your bad behavior forever, and the questionable practices of many for-profit colleges are starting to catch up with them. Enrollment at the University of Phoenix -- the largest for-profit college in the United States -- has fallen by half, to about 213,000. We laid the smackdown on predatory lenders during the financial crisis, and it's time to do the same thing with for-profit colleges. To keep predator colleges from wrecking our faith in the college degree -- still the best pathway to a middle-class life -- we need to act now. For-profit colleges have flunked their final exam. Now it's up to their rich benefactor, Uncle Sam, to make sure they don't go back to school in the fall. Editor's Note: An earlier version of this article said the San Diego campus of the University of Phoenix had been banned from enrolling military veterans last year; that issue has been resolved.\n"]}

A former Syrian doctor has been jailed after police discovered a hoard of explosive ingredients and bomb-making instructions at his home. Faris Al-Khori had dozens of chemicals, poisonous materials, bolts and handwritten notes on how to make a bomb, a court heard. The equipment was\u00a0found purely by chance in April last year after a fire at a block of flats in the Muirhouse area of Edinburgh. Firefighters, who were\u00a0responding\u00a0to a 999 call over a fire within\u00a0a rubbish chute on the 11th floor, had forced entry to a flat registered to Al-Khori and found jars containing various powders. Castor beans, which can be used to make ricin, were also found. The building was evacuated while the police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts were called in to test the substances - some of which were years old. Al-Khori also had a small amount of a highly volatile explosive lead picrate which was so dangerous that the Forensic Explosives Laboratory refused to take delivery of it and it was destroyed. A search was carried out at a further block where the 62-year-old lived with his wife in Leith and a further haul of material was recovered. Both blocks of flats were evacuated and the areas around them sealed off. Al-Khori said the materials were used for cleaning and as fertiliser but in February he pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act. Police seized bomb-making instructions and equipment including a bag containing an electrical circuit (pictured) from the properties . Two Coleman's Mustard jars were found being used to store\u00a0a small amount of a highly volatile explosive, lead picrate . Sentencing him to three years and four months in prison, Judge Lady Wolffe said: 'You assembled large quantities without lawful purpose and some were stored in a high rise flat in a densely populated area. 'The number and nature of the explosive substances and the places you chose to store them lead me to conclude there is no alternative to a custodial sentence.' The court heard that\u00a0much\u00a0of the bomb-making equipment, which also included electrical circuits, had been ordered from online retailers. Defence QC Brian McConnachie said: 'What seems to be clear from the narrative and material is that it has been directly ordered from legitimate companies, mainly through Amazon. 'The material has always been delivered to domestic addresses and paid for by genuine credit cards registered to Mr al-Khori. 'It has always been done in the open and over a period of time. Many of the items have never been opened. Al-Khori pleaded guilty to a breach of the 1883 Explosive Substances Act after officers seized dozens of explosive ingredients . 'It is difficult to understand the hoarding of this material but it does appear that he is someone who has some kind of academic interest in the materials. 'It seems he has accumulated materials with some kind of peculiar interest in the subject without ever intending to do anything or make anything.' Detective Superintendent David Gordon, who led the investigation, said: 'This was a significant and complex inquiry for Police Scotland, to safely deal with these volatile items and seek to establish Al-Khori's motives for storing them. 'A thorough investigation by the Organised Crime and Counter Terrorism Unit and Crown Office found no known links to terrorist offences and we believe Faris Al-Khori was acting independently. However, he showed utter disregard for the occupants of both buildings. 'Thanks to the swift actions of our partners in the Fire Service and armed forces, we were able to quickly assess the contents of the flats and make them safe by removing a number of items for forensic examination or controlled explosion. The items from the flats in Edinburgh were discovered by chance during a fire within the rubbish chute which was then evacuated whilst the items were recovered . 'I am also grateful to the City of Edinburgh Council for their work to re-house vulnerable residents whilst we carried out our searches. 'Public safety was at the forefront of our response to this incident and all agencies worked together to minimise any risk to the public. 'Al-Khori's activities went unnoticed for many years, demonstrating the importance of community vigilance in our efforts to keep Scotland safe. 'Counter terrorism is one of Police Scotland's highest priorities, and whilst Al-Khori has no such known links we will always treat all information received with the utmost importance where any risk to the public is identified.' Al-Khori, who was born in Damascus and raised in a Christian family, trained as a doctor in Iraq but has never practised medicine in Britain after arriving here in 1984. He was the full-time carer for his wife, who suffers from schizophrenia, and has had British citizenship since 1998. Police and army Explosive Ordnance Device (EOD) experts had to be called in to remove the explosive materials . Lindsey Miller, the Crown Office's Procurator Fiscal for Organised Crime and Counter-Terrorism, added: 'The conviction of Al-Khori is a good example of agencies working closely together to protect the public. 'Al-Khori possessed a significant number and volume of explosive substances across two properties in Edinburgh as well as recipes for explosives. 'We worked closely with Police Service of Scotland and other agencies to prepare the case to ensure that Al-Khori was brought to justice.'

Chief Superintendent John O'Hare says the kick-off was agreed by all parties and revealed that the decision is down to good behaviour from supporters of each side. 'We have not objected to the 4pm kick-off time at all,' he told Sportsmail. 'That 4pm has been agreed is testament to the excellent behaviour of the overwhelming majority of fans who have attended previous derby fixtures. 'It is the positive behaviour of both sets of fans at previous derby fixtures that means we feel confident this Sunday\u2019s fixture will continue that tradition of the fixture being a safe and enjoyable one.' Rio Ferdinand was hit by an object thrown from the crowd during the Manchester derby in December 2012 . In February, Merseyside Police launched a legal challenge after the Everton v Liverpool match, which was also televised, was chosen for a 5.30pm start although they later withdrew their objection. Police in Manchester have met representatives from supporters groups representing each club and agreed a series of measures. Inside the ground fans in and close to the away end will be limited to two drinks every time they visit the bar. No street drinking will be allowed while police will also be searching supporters and keeping an eye out for pyrotechnics. GMP also say they have no intention to hold back City supporters at the final whistle but add that this could be reviewed on the day. Footage on You Tube showed the unrest when United played City in a late kick-off at Wembley in 2011 . City won that FA Cup semi-final, but 34 arrests were made due to crowd trouble outside the stadium . The last time United and City met in a late kick-off for a weekend match was in the FA Cup semi-final at Wembley in 2011. That clash, won by City 1-0, started at 5.15pm and was marred by a series of skirmishes on Wembley Way and on coach parks close to the stadium with 34 arrests made amid scenes some fans described as 'a free for all'. The last late afternoon kick-off in Manchester was for a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford in 2004. After November's derby at the Etihad Stadium, won 1-0 by City, video footage captured dozens of fans fighting outside a nearby pub around 90 minutes after the final whistle. In April 2012, Vincent Kompany's header settled the derby in a match that was played on a Monday night at the Etihad Stadium.\n"]}

I tried to slow my breathing as she looked straight at me. I needed to be calm to take my shot. There were three other rhinos with her and, let's be honest, they're not called a crash of rhino for nothing. I raised my camera and began to photograph what could soon become an extinct pachyderm. The luxurious Ulusaba Game Reserve is  in South Africa's Sabi Sands and is Sir Richard Branson's private reserve . Thankfully the female found my scrawny presence of absolutely no consequence, and instead wandered off in search of tastier herbivorous options. I was with my mate James and we laughed awkwardly as we climbed back into the vehicle. My mum \u2013 Sky TV presenter Kay Burley \u2013 was sitting statue-still on board, having adopted her best nonchalant expression, but she wasn't fooling either of us. The holiday at Ulusaba, Sir Richard Branson's private game reserve in South Africa's Sabi Sands, was my reward for graduating. I have been on safari before but this was different. I'm an amateur car photographer and wanted to swap taking photos of Ferraris and focus instead on the roar of a bush lion, the yawn of a hippo, the prowl of a glorious leopard or a close-up of a fearless rhino. We achieved all of them. Kutner came face to face with three rhinos, along with documenting the roar of a bush lion, the yawn of a hippo and the prowl of a glorious leopard . Just the day before, we had tracked the crash of rhino on foot. With 1,000 rhinos killed by poachers in South Africa last year alone, they are increasingly difficult to view. Danny, our brilliant tracker, who could find a spelling mistake in a dictionary, had eventually located them, but with dusk fast approaching we reluctantly headed back to the Land Rover. The African bush is not a place to be on foot in the dark. We should know. We'd spent the earlier part of the day up close and personal with a pride of lions. Our ranger, Trevor, steered the Land Rover as close as he dared without disturbing the big cats. The lioness, who could have taken any one of us out with a casual swipe of her front paw, looked in our direction, checked her cubs and allowed us to stay. Trevor, also a photographer, whispered advice on appropriate settings for my Nikon D600 to achieve the best results. Heading back to the luxury accommodation at Cliff Lodge, a two-bedroom apartment within Rock Lodge (Mum described it as glamping but with solid walls, luxury furnishings, soft sheets and a chef to conjure up our favourite food), we talked about all the other animals we wanted to see, if possible. Alexander Kutner with mum, Sky TV presenter Kay Burley, at Ulusaba, Sir Richard Branson's private game reserve in South Africa's Sabi Sands . Trevor said he and Danny would try but couldn't promise anything. Nevertheless, given the conservation, ecology and anti-poaching work being carried out by Ulusaba and adjoining camps, we were feeling confident. The following day we found ourselves slap bang in the middle of a herd of buffalo, mean-looking guys who glare at you as if you owe them money. Danny, who will happily track on foot for lion, leopard, elephant and rhino \u2013 four of the Big Five \u2013 makes an exception for buffalo. Alexander said a lioness looked in his group's direction, checked her cubs and allowed them to stay . Trevor started up the engine and we moved on. Pausing at a watering hole, we were delighted to see two young male elephants wandering towards us. They made their way into the water and proceeded to perform for us \u2013 a photographer's dream! We returned to the lodge to relax and sort through the hundreds of photos we'd captured. Chef served up kudu burgers for lunch.\u00a0We'd seen plenty of these handsome antelope during our morning game drive\u2026 and Mum decided to pass on that meal. Ulusaba means 'place of little fear'. That's because the koppie where Rock Lodge sits provided the ancient Shangaan warriors with the perfect lookout point . Trevor wondered what else we'd like to see. 'Cheetah, please,' we cried. He took us on a long, bumpy drive to the wide-open plains where cheetah can run free in their hunt for food. They are extremely rare in this area of the Sabi Sands and, despite hour after hour of tracking, there were no paw-print clues. However, Trevor had one last surprise. Danny heard the call of a honey bird and a solitary warning from an impala antelope. These led him on foot to a pair of leopard cubs frolicking up a tree. There is no sighting quite as magical as a leopard, and six-month-old cubs are the perfect age to provide incredible images of their playful behaviour. Eventually, with a heavy heart and my camera packed away, we left the African bush. Until the next time...

It was worth the risk, the bad treatment and the fear, hard as that may be to believe. Simply put, I have a better life now than I did before. But my journey across the Mediterranean, like those of thousands of other migrants, wasn't easy. Here's my story. It all started late last year when I lost my job in Dubai. My work visa had expired, and I had nowhere else to go. I'm Syrian, and returning to Syria wasn't an option -- going back means you either have to kill or be killed. But Syrians don't need visas to get into Turkey, so Turkey it was. I arrived in the country in December with an old dream in my mind: reaching Europe. While in Istanbul, I discovered many Facebook pages about illegal smuggling from Turkey to Italy by sea. All of them mentioned that Mersin, a port city on the southern border, was the jump off point, so I made my way there. I met a Syrian guy in a hotel in Mersin who had already paid money to one smuggler and was planning to depart within a few days. He told me his smuggler was a decent man with a great reputation. Reputation: It was a funny thing to hear for the first time, the thought that these people, who I always considered to be little more than criminals, were concerned about what people thought of them. But why wouldn't they be? It's a long-term business, and the Syrian conflict isn't ending anytime soon. So I decided to meet the guy. We spoke about terms of payment and agreed on a fee of $6,500. Some of the money would be deposited into an insurance company, with the usual transaction fees. When I reached Italy the money would be released to the smuggler -- or, if I changed my mind, I'd be able to get some of it back. \"Be ready all day, every day for the next few days, because you might receive the call to go,\" the smuggler told me. One evening a few days later, I got the call and my journey began. They gathered 100 men and women in five buses and drove us to the smuggling point. It was far from Mersin. We walked for 30 minutes, through rough terrain and orange farms near the beach, in darkness to avoid detection by police. The idea was to take us in three small boats to the main ship. I still remember an old lady, barely able to walk, with her two sons, marching along as fast as they could to try to reach the boats. They were told that if they didn't walk faster, the boat would leave without them. I asked myself so many time what could possibly drive a normal person to put himself and his family in this kind of danger. I decided that anyone with a past but no future was capable of doing crazy things. Finally we reached the boat. It was just as the smuggler described. For three days we waited in the boat for two other parties of 100 people to join us before departing. We were in the middle of the Mediterranean, far enough away from the surrounding countries to be in international waters. On the fourth day we started our journey with a mix of excitement and fear -- fear that this madness often ends in tragedy, ends with us as numbers piled on top of all the other unfortunate, nameless numbers who never made it to the other side. But there was no going back -- it's a one-way ticket. We sailed for eight hours before the boat's engine broke down. There were around 300 of us on board, and as the waves began to push us towards Cyprus the crew sent a distress signal, hoping to alert maybe a U.N. or Red Cross boat, anyone who could help us. Eventually our boat hit a cliff and got stuck. Luckily, before long, a Cypriot coast guard ship arrived to rescue us and deport us back to Turkey. Turkish authorities fingerprinted and released us within a few hours. Some of the people I had been traveling with said they weren't going to try to make the trip again. When they asked me what I planned to do, I told them I would do it again tomorrow if I could -- another journey through a sea where no prayer works, where no one is bigger than nature, where you can feel so small, no matter how big your dreams are. I'd already lost everything. My family didn't know what I was doing, but I dreamed of being a human being who is treated like one. I wasn't going to stop. So I called the smuggler the same night I was released, and said I wanted to get on the next ship out. Two days later I received the call, and again I headed to a smuggling point. This time, they had a bigger boat -- a cargo ship, in fact, maybe 85 meters long or more. It took five days to get everyone on board the ship -- 391 of us in total, refugees from cities all over Syria. And for the first time, I began to feel like I was in jail, trapped in conditions no human should ever suffer. We lived in the hold. There were no mattresses or sheets, but we found some wooden planks to put our stuff on to keep it from getting wet. Hundreds of migrants killed when boat capsizes . For five days we had no food and little water. But at least it meant not having to make frequent trips to the \"toilet,\" if you could call it that, which was an old car tire covered with a piece of cloth. Huge waves crashed against the ship from all angles and water leaked in from the ceiling as we slept on the cold metal floor of the ship, the smell of urine emanating from the corner. Seven days in, despite the poor conditions, everything was going well and we were nearing the island-dotted seas near Greece. On the eleventh day, 200 miles off the coast of southern Italy our guides began to alert Italian authorities to our presence. We were adrift at sea, they told the authorities, with no captain or crew. And that was actually true -- we didn't have a registered pilot, just one guy who had worked on this ship before. An Icelandic ship -- working in conjunction with Frontex, the joint European Union border patrol -- rescued us from our captain-less boat with the help of a scientific research boat from New Zealand. The rescue ship approached us but was unable to get close at first because the waves were so high. We knew we would have to wait some time before leaving our boat forever. The other refugees were waving their hands like children and then telling each other: \"Stop waving, they've already seen us.\" I was one of the last 10 people to be rescued from the boat. I can still see it like it was yesterday; it was the rebirth of a new life. Why migrants head to Mediterranean . They took us to Catania, on Sicily, where we finally reached land a day later. When we arrived, the first thing the Italian authorities did was look after the urgent medical cases. There was a man who was poisoned by the drinking water on the boat, a few pregnant women and old people who needed medical attention. They took us to a refugee camp and the only thing anyone talked about was being fingerprinted. They were saying: \"We didn't risk everything to be refugees. We are not going to give our fingerprints, even if they torture us.\" Later that night a Moroccan-Italian man told us not to worry: \"They will not fingerprint you.\" They would simply take us to different camps and we could leave from there. Twelve days after it began, our journey to Europe was over. I spent two days in Sicily before making my way first to Milan with two Syrian guys who had become friends. We decided to go to Germany and went to Paris first and ended up in a city called Saarbrucken. I didn't know where my fellow travellers were heading, but I knew one thing: my dream of making it to Europe, no matter the cost and risk involved, had been achieved. It was worth it.\n"]}

Human rights campaigners claim he has been 'abandoned' by the Foreign Office . The 32-year-old bar manager, who has dual New Zealand and British nationality, was found guilty of insulting religion along with the bar\u2019s Burmese owner and another manager, despite apologising profusely for posting the picture. All three were given the same sentence. MPs and human rights campaigners said Mr Blackwood, who is married with a young daughter, is enduring appalling conditions in the notorious Insein prison. They also claimed the British Government had \u2018turned its back\u2019 on Mr Blackwood, who lived in Middlesbrough until his family moved to New Zealand when he was four. The 32-year-old bar manager, who has dual New Zealand and British nationality, was found guilty of insulting religion because of this picture . In a Commons answer, a Foreign Office Minister admitted he was not aware Mr Blackwood was a British citizen. Last night, his father Brian insisted that the family had informed the British authorities of his son\u2019s dual nationality after his arrest. Although New Zealand diplomats were taking the lead, he said that the family expected the Foreign Office to exert pressure on Burma. Middlesbrough MP Andy McDonald said: 'Philip Blackwood has been unjustly imprisoned for an honest mistake for which he has already issued a heartfelt apology. 'As a British citizen, rather than turning their back on Mr Blackwood, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office should be pulling every available leaver to secure his immediate and unconditional release so that he can return to his family.' There is international concern over a surge of religious nationalism in Burma, ruled until recently by a military junta. A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesman said: \u2018Our ambassador in Burma made clear that we were following the case closely when he raised it with the Burmese Minister of the Presidency. \u2018Our embassy in Rangoon has provided advice and support to the New Zealanders on Mr Blackwood\u2019s case.\u2019\n"]}

This weekend brings with it arguably Saints' biggest match of the season, with the visit of Tottenham likely to be key in the fight for European qualification. Mauricio Pochettino's first return to St Mary's adds extra spice to a match, ahead of which his successor felt the need to hold a team meeting to refocus his players' minds. Ronald Koeman says his Southampton players must remain focused on European qualification . Koeman spoke to Victor Wanyama and his other players to refocus them on the last five league games . Wanyama's claims that Arsenal were interested in his services were the catalyst and, while defending the 23-year-old by saying the story was 'bull****', Koeman called for his players to show more common sense. 'You know always in the last part of the season there are rumours talking about interest in players,' the Saints boss said. 'I don't like to say every time it's true or it's not true. 'It's important that everybody knows his position in the club. They have contracts - you can't talk about moving because you have a contract. That's not respectful to the club. 'We spoke about that, that we need that focus. If we don't have really that focus, we can't bring the level what we normally bring this season.' Such speculation about the likes of Wanyama, Nathaniel Clyne and Morgan Schneidelin brings back memories of last summer's talent drain from St Mary's. Wanyama's future came under question after an interview where he seemed to hint at a move to Arsenal . Koeman has repeatedly insisted a similar situation will not arise this time around, although he is wise enough to know the south-coast club's place in the food chain. 'On one side it's normal because, okay, we are Southampton,' Koeman said. 'We are not Man United, because they are always talking about new players, and normally in teams like Southampton, a little bit more down, they are talking about interest in players of Southampton. 'We know that, but it's up to the press. They can write and they can say what they want, but no problem. 'We have to keep that spirit together and that was my message to the players. 'We can't do anything about that. You have to look out if they ask you that kind of questions. That's your job. There has also been speculation about the futures of Morgan Schneiderlin (left) and Nathaniel Clyne . Southampton come up against former boss Mauricio Pochettino on Saturday in the race for the Europa League . 'You're not a young kid. You have to respond, and if you respond you have to know what you respond.' Koeman says he will not be enforcing a media ban to keep his players out of trouble - something he accepts is more difficult now given the power held by agents. The former Holland international also understands the ambitions his players may well harbour, admitting he spoke out of turn a few times when he was younger. 'Of course, when I played in Holland, okay, I was looking to play in a bigger team - that's normal,' Koeman said. 'If you are not really in the highest level and you get opportunities to play in a higher level, okay, you like it, of course. Everybody likes the best. 'Everybody likes to play Champions League football - that's normal. I'm not surprised about that.'\n"]}

On August 10, 2014, the church held a 'pig wrestling' event where the animals were 'punched in the face, kicked, body-slammed, yelled at and thrown onto a barrel', according to the\u00a0Global Conversation Group. 'Wrestling, as a sport, is contested by two human opponents, evenly matched, each of whom enters into the match voluntarily with mutually agreed-upon rules and a common goal,' the group wrote on its website. 'Not so in \"matches\" like pig wrestling, where frightened animals are unwilling participants exploited by teams of humans for entertainment.' The group also accused the church of being in violation of Wisconsin Chapter 951, Crimes Against Animals, which outlaws cockfighting, dog fighting and any other similar fighting between animals or animals and humans, according to its Change.org page. The church announced  in a statement that moving forward the parish's talents could be 'spent in areas that are less controversial'. 'After much prayer and many hours of discussion, we realize that what we had for 44 years in the Original Pig Rassle was memorable, legal and great family fun,' the statement on its website read.

'We also realize that our parish and diocesan talents could be better spent in areas that are less controversial. 'It is with great regret that we have discontinued the Original Pig Rassle, we are however, very excited to begin this new tradition at St. Patrick Parish.'

Manchester United are hoping to leave their rivals behind in the race to sign the young winger . PSV coach Phillip Cocu admitted: 'Van Gaal is a very good coach and the Premier League is great' Van gall refused to squash the reports in his weekly media briefing. When asked about the Depay link, Van Gaal said: 'I don\u2019t discuss it with the media, you know my answer. 'I have a lot of relationships with players. I cannot buy all the players I've coached already.' Van Gaal, who worked with Depay at the World Cup, made inquiries over the player's availability last summer but decided to keep track of his progress rather than make a move. That could prove to be a costly decision, with the Dutch club looking for around \u00a325m for his services after he scored 20 goals in 28 games. Depay, who has 'dream chaser' tattooed to his chest and is pictured here modelling a three-wheeled bike in October 2013, could line up at Old Trafford next season. PSV coach Phillip Cocu was unaware of the meeting when asked on Friday. He said: 'Van Gaal is a very good coach with whom I have worked and he was always very pleasant and the Premier League is a great league. 'I have contact with Memphis on a daily basis about many things, but not on a specific club or league.' United hold the upper hand in the hunt for Depay thanks to Van Gaal, who worked with the player during his stint in charge of Holland. PSV appear to be resigned to losing their star man this summer.

Speaking to Dutch daily newspaper Algemeen Dagblad, Van Steijn said: 'If I compare him to a young Cristiano Ronaldo at the time, then Depay has more strings to his bow. I like him better.

However, Mayweather's most unhealthy food craving has got to be 'fried hot dogs... with barbecue sauce'. Jeffries explains that she tries her best to ake them as healthy as possible: 'I cut them longways, and fry them up in a little coconut oil. I spice that up the barbeque sauce, too. 'I add a oranges, orange zest, and other spices. He loves barbecue sauce. Everything with barbecue sauce. But that's life. You like what you know.' As well as unusual eating requests, Jeffries also has to cope with Mayweather's unconventional timekeeping. The 38-year-old does not followed a structured training regime and prefers to decide when he does things according to how he is feeling, which can pose problems for his 24-hour chef who charges around \u00a31,000 per meal. 'If Champ wants a meal at three, four, five, six in the morning, I have to be ready for that,' Jeffries said. 'He's called me at four and says, 'I want that oxtail.' Finding organic food stores in the early hours of the morning is also challenging, especially in Las Vegas. Mayweather and Pacquiao are just days away from their $300m mega-fight in Las Vegas .

Italian quartet Mirco Antenucci, Giuseppe Bellusci, Dario del Fabro and Marco Silvestri, Frenchman Souleymane Doukara and Albanian Edgar Cani all told beleaguered head coach Neil Redfearn they were injured and could not travel to London. Five of the sextet were signed by banned president Massimo Cellino, while Cani's deal was set-up by the Italian before he was banned by the Football League for failing its Owners and Directors Test. Mirco Antenucci is one of six Leeds players to have withdrawn from the squad to face Charlton with injury . It is understood that Redfearn was not aware of any problems with the players and that United's physio was not aware of any injuries. After receiving criticism from Leeds fans on Twitter after the story surfaced, Antenucci Tweeted: 'I'm reading a lot bad thing about myself in the last time.tomorrow i'll not be in the match because I got injured yesterday.it's the truth. 'I read so much wickedness and insults in many posts.i'm a serious professional but if someone likes to insult me there is no problem. my injury is in the right leg did yesterday in training .a muscle injury.' Goalkeeper Silvestri also Tweeted, posting a picture of a cut on his back which he suffered during Tuesday's loss at Norwich. He, Antenucci and Bellusci have been first-team regulars this season, with Cani, Del Fabro and Doukara resigned to roles on the fringes. It is understood that Neil Redfearn and the medical team were unaware of the players' injuries . Redfearn's position at Elland Road has become increasingly threatened over recent weeks, despite leading the club to Championship safety after taking off from ill-fated predecessors David Hockaday and Darko Milanic.

Referee: Svein Oddvar Moen (Norway) He was then a spectator on the half hour when his international team-mate got the second climbing unmarked to head Dani Alves\u2019 cross past Salvatore Sirigu to make it 5-1 on aggregate. PSG\u2019s soft centre cost them in the first leg and it was cruelly exposed again. Luiz was also booked inside the first five minutes for a foul on Andres Iniesta, who ran the first half. The man who won the World Cup for Spain but is these days criticised for neither scoring nor assisting went on a sublime run for the first goal, pulling away from Edinson Cavani and swerving past Marco Verratti before releasing Neymar. The French champions thought they were back in the game between the two Barcelona goals when on 17 minutes Zlatan Ibrahimovic had the ball in the net but he was a yard offside when Blaise Matuidi slipped him through and the flag was raised to rule out the goal. The Swede was jeered by Barcelona supporters in the early stages as was former Barcelona defender Maxwell but such was Barca\u2019s dominance that home fans eased up on the light-hearted abuse. Suarez and Messi were also impressive in the first half and Alves looked like a man trying to impress a potential employer. PSG could still be a possible destination for him beyond the end of this season. He tested Sirigu from distance before his assist for Neymar\u2019s second. With Suarez and Alves snapping into challenges and Iniesta and Neymar providing the finesse Barcelona were completely dominant \u2013 to the extent that for once Messi was not their most impressive performer. The home side eased up after the break and PSG breathed more easily without ever threatening to get back into the tie. Rakitic saw his shot saved and Messi went close with chip that Sirigu gathered.

Missing the domestic campaign has been tough but a final appearance in Berlin would be some consolation. Luis Enrique\u2019s side were so comfortable at half-time Xavi replaced the impeccable Iniesta at the break. And it wasn\u2019t long before Busquets and Suarez were also given early cuts. Barcelona still have a league to win and play the Catalan derby against Espanyol this weekend with sill just a narrow two point lead over Real Madrid. Iniesta had done enough in 45 minutes of football to not need to come out after half time. His performance and at times Barca\u2019s was a throwback to some of their best football under Pep Guardiola when the won this completion in both 2009 and 2011. Iniesta was in sensational form for Barcelona before replaced at half time by veteran midfielder Xavi . Barcelona's captain had been criticised earlier this season for a lack of goals and assists but he looks to be back to his best . Guardiola was the name on most supporters lips at half time as news filtered through that Bayern were mauling Porto and were also heading for the semi-finals.

It appeared the car was accidentally left running in the garage, but it was unclear for how long, investigators said. Neighbors lined the streets and sidewalks in the suburban neighborhood next to Long Island's Nassau County. Some cried as police officers and firefighters walked around the Cape Cod-style, two-story home. Before police officially identified the victims, neighbor Helga Harter told The Associated Press that the couple was named Jerry Hugel and Marie Hugel, who were in their 80s and had known her for 40 years. 'They were wonderful people,' Harter said through tears as she stood on a street corner, looking at the home. 'They were married for 60 years.'

The Labour leader used a speech in Edinburgh to claim the Tory election campaign has descended into 'desperation and panic', as some polls put Labour ahead across the UK. But Mr Miliband has been rocked by a survey showing that in Scotland, 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour, robbing him of any possibility of an overall majority. Scroll down for video . A poll of Scotlans shows 49 per cent of people plan to vote for the SNP, with just 25 per cent backing Labour . There has been a surge in support for the SNP in the months since the independence referendum in September . In September's referendum, 55 per cent voted in favour of staying in the UK, but the SNP has seen a surge in support since then and is set to take dozens of seats from Labour in the general election on May 7. The new YouGov poll for The Times shows Labour is down four points on last month to their lowest level since the survey began in 2007. The SNP is up three points to 49 per cent, a record high. Support for the Conservatives was up two points at 18 per cent and backing for the Liberal Democrats was up one point at 4 per cent. The results have delighted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, who insisted she is taking 'absolutely nothing for granted'. 'The polls are hugely encouraging and they show that that case that the SNP is putting forward for an end to austerity and support for the NHS and public services is winning support across Scotland.' Ms Sturgeon has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7. However, the SNP leader demanded full fiscal autonomy for Scotland in return, meaning all money raised in tax north of the border would be spent there. Labour leader Ed Miliband said the SNP's plan 'will mean a \u00a37.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances' In a joint press conference, Mr Miliband was joined by his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy . The SNP has proposed 'a modest increase in public spending' to end austerity and allow Scotland's health budget to rise by \u00a32 billion by 2020. 'Let us lift austerity and have spending increases in the next parliament that are fiscally responsible but allow us to spend more money on our vital public services like the health service,' she said. 'I am proposing an increase in spending in the health service across the UK that would see by the end of this decade an additional \u00a32 billion being spent on the NHS in Scotland. 'That's the choice we have at this election - continued austerity being proposed by the Tories and Labour, or an alternative to austerity, which is what the SNP is proposing, and we need a strong Scottish voice in Westminster that can force that alternative to austerity.' But in a joint press conference, Mr Miliband, his shadow chancellor Ed Balls and Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy said the SNP's plan 'will mean a \u00a37.6 billion hole in Scotland's finances'. Mr Miliband said: 'Today I challenge Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to say how they will fill this GBP7.6 billion gap. Which services will be cut? Which taxes will be raised? And what cuts will it mean for pensioners in Scotland when they are taken out of the UK pensions system? 'The SNP claim in this campaign to be proposing no reductions in spending, but in fact they are planning dramatic reductions in spending.\u00a0They must now come clean.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon, pictured in Sterling today, has offered to prop up a Labour government, even if the Tories win more seats on May 7 .

And I will never sell Britain short by abandoning the pooling and sharing of resources. Because this is a pooling and sharing which benefits all parts of our country, because we look after each other and we know we can only tackle the problems our country faces across the whole of the United Kingdom.' Speaking ahead of Mr Miliband's speech, Ms Sturgeon claimed that Labour was 'wrong' in its analysis. 'This is desperation on the part of the Labour Party,' the SNP leader said during a campaign visit to Stirling. 'Instead of putting forward a positive case of their own, they are resorting to the same fears and smears that they resorted to during the referendum. 'The truth is, the only cuts on the horizon for Scotland are the ones that the Tories are proposing and Labour are backing.'\n"]}

The six-strong gang dressed in high-vis jackets were captured on CCTV working throughout Thursday night having successfully broken into the\u00a0basement of the building in the heart of London\u2019s jewellery district. Shockingly, the footage reveals they returned again on Saturday - spending another eight hours cleaning out the jewels and cash left there for safekeeping. Scroll down for video . The Mirror has obtained the first pictures of the six-strong gang which raided Hatton Gardens last week . Images obtained by the Daily Mirror\u00a0reveal the precise timings of the raid for the first time - as well as the fact they used wheelie bins to remove millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables from the safe. Scotland Yard tonight refused to confirm to MailOnline whether they had seen the footage before it was handed to them by the Mirror, but it is likely to place even more pressure on police already under fire for not responding to the alarm. The footage begins at 9.23pm \u2013 just four minutes after staff at the safety deposit centre lock up for the Easter weekend \u2013 as the first thief appears on camera carrying a black bin bag. It was unclear exactly where the cameras were situated, but at least one is aimed outside the building and shows a white van thought to be the getaway vehicle. Over the following four nights, half a dozen raiders are seen lugging heavy-duty tools, including massive bolt cutters and a red monkey wrench down to the secure vault. Each member of the gang is wearing builder\u2019s overalls and high-visibility vests. At least one has a balaclava over his face, while others wear dust masks \u2013 but each one is partially reconisable. The first raider to appear has been dubbed Mr Ginger after the colour of his hair. Another, wearing a builder\u2019s hat, has been referred to as Mr Strong and is seen carrying steel supports that may have been used for the diamond-tipped drill that police say cut through into the vault. The gang is thought to have hidden in an office before abseiling down a lift shaft and drilling into a vault . The Tall Man \u2013 who wears an Adidas tracksuit \u2013 carries two red tools up and down the stairs. Another, dubbed the Old Man because of his grey hair, later appears to struggle for breath in the footage as he lugs bags from the vault. Two other raiders have been nicknamed The Gent, for his smart brown shoes, and Mr Montana because he is wears a sweatshirt emblazoned with the word. Reports say that he has a shaved head, and possibly an earring in his left ear. At about 9.40pm the gang disappear into the building. At 7.52am on Good Friday, according to the footage, members of the gang can be seen again. The street camera captures the white Transit pull up to the alley. On Sunday, at around 6am, the gem thieves can be seen dragging heavy wheelie bins and several black bags back up the stairs. It has been reported these contained potentially millions of pounds worth of jewellery and valuables. The last trace of the raiders is recorded at 6.44am on Easter Sunday, when a white van pulls up and the gang load it with all the remaining equipment and disappear. Detective Chief Inspector Paul Johnson of the Flying Squad, speaks to journalists outside Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd today following last weekend's burglary in London . Another suspect, riding a moped, may also be connected to the gang. The raid was not discovered until the following Tuesday . The thieves apparently thought they had covered all their bases when covering their footsteps, but had failed to realise they had missed the cameras. A source told the Mirror: 'This was clearly the work of a professional gang who planned this job down to every last detail. 'But they may have made a mistake in leaving this footage behind.' The footage came to light as Scotland Yard was forced to admit it did not respond to a burglar alarm triggered during the raid - which could make it liable for million in compensation. That\u00a0failure to investigate immediately left the gang free to work uninterrupted over Easter and escape with gems and cash worth \u2018millions and millions\u2019 from 70 deposit boxes - as can clearly be seen in the video. Officers were informed that the warning had been triggered shortly after midnight on Good Friday. But they decided that the possibility of a burglary did not need immediate investigation. Instead, a private security guard is understood to have made a cursory check of the building. Last night, jewellers who rent boxes with the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd security firm accused the police of incompetence and threatened to sue them and the owners of the deposit company. One jeweller, a 63-year-old named Michael, said: \u2018As far as I\u2019m concerned the police have got a lot to answer for. Suing anyone is a last resort but it\u2019s something I would consider.\u2019 A gang of criminals broke into the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit Ltd over the Easter Bank Holiday weekend . Another jeweller called Ryan, who runs a business with his father in Hatton Garden, added: \u2018It is just unbelievable that they could ignore a call from an alarm company.\u2019 The deposit firm has also faced criticism over the building\u2019s \u2018antiquated\u2019 alarm system. Security expert Seamus Fahy, 47, said: \u2018It was a well-planned heist, but the lack of modern technology made it a lot less difficult than it should have been.\u2019 A Scotland Yard spokesman said: \u2018A grade was applied to the call that meant that no police response was deemed to be required. We are now investigating why this grade was applied to the call. \u2018It is too early to say if the handling of the call would have had an impact on the outcome of the incident.\u2019\n"]}

Both centre-backs' current deals expire this summer and it seems highly unlikely Distin, who is 38 in December and has played more for the under-21s in the last month than he has the first team, will be retained. Alcaraz, 33 in July, has more of a chance of securing a short-term extension as Martinez looks to strengthen and restructure his defence in the summer. Roberto Martinez insists 37-year-old defender Sylvain Distin still has time to prove he deserves a new deal . Antolin Alcaraz, who joined Everton from Wigan where he played under Martinez, could get a new deal . While the Toffees boss is keen to advance the talents of younger players - Tyias Browning and Brendan Galloway the two most likely to benefit - he has not ruled out retaining existing senior players. 'There are only two players out of contract and we have two loan players (Aaron Lennon and Christian Atsu) and those decisions will be made when we have finished the season,' said Martinez. 'The next six games could have a massive bearing on that. Ninety minutes is a big opportunity to change people's views. 'All individuals will be judged over that period. In football it does not matter if you have a contract or not, you always need to improve and show the right attitude and show you are ready to be part of the future of the club.

The data comes nine months after commander Sarah West, the first woman to captain a Royal Navy warship, was flown back to the UK following claims she had a sexual relationship with a member of her crew.

{"question_id": 53, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Five years after the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and unleashed the largest marine oil spill in the nation's history, we are still experiencing -- yet only beginning to truly understand -- its profound environmental and economic repercussions. The immediate aftermath of the oil spill has been well documented, with declines in tourism and the seafood industry, as well as the significant destruction of wildlife in the region. Since then, the amount of oil in the area has dissipated and communities have started to show signs of recovery. In fact, reports indicate that the Gulf of Mexico's seafood industry, which supplies the United States with roughly 40% of its seafood, is finally starting to rebound. However, profound challenges remain, in part because so many questions about the long-term consequences remain unanswered. To this day, it's still unclear where all of the oil went, exactly how much remains or whether the reappearance of wildlife is a result of adaptation or a signal that the crisis is truly abating. One of the populations that can provide insight into these questions is the Gulf crab. Crabs play an important role in the region: Roughly 60 million pounds were fished in the Gulf in 2012, earning tens of millions in revenue. Yet in the aftermath of the spill, changes to crustacean communities in the area were quite apparent to the naked eye. Researchers documented substantial differences in appearance, and deformities in crabs that were affected by the spill including lesions so numerous they ate through the joints, forcing limbs to fall off. These traits have affected not only the crabs' market value but also likely their ability to survive. While these changes in outward appearance have dissipated in the short-term, the health of these crabs could still be precarious. I have been working with colleagues at Florida International University and University of Louisiana at Lafayette to better understand what might be happening biologically inside the crab when it is exposed to oil and the dispersant used to respond to the spill. Using the power of genomics and computational biology, we analyzed the genes of flat back mud crabs that were exposed to oil from the Macondo Prospect where the Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling when it exploded or to a combination of oil and dispersant in the lab. By studying gene expression, the process that turns information from a gene into a product that functions within a cell, we searched for indicators that might signal exposure to oil and, based on the types of changes we might see, clues as to how the crabs respond. Although we are still in the early stages of our research, we are seeing significant differences in gene expression connected to exposure -- meaning the crabs are turning some genes on or off in response to oil and dispersant. We are still working to determine whether these changes impact their ability to survive and reproduce. It's not just Gulf crabs that are experiencing changes. Research on different species and other aspects of the regional environment is starting to show that there could be long-term effects resulting from the oil spill and the response to the spill. This not only has consequences for the Gulf area, where oil drilling continues, but also for communities along the Atlantic Coast, where the Obama administration has recently announced a plan to open unprecedented oil and natural gas exploration. (BP's vice president of communications, Geoff Morrell, told CNN that wildlife species in the Gulf have \"bounced back and \"there is no data that suggests there are any long-term population-level impacts to any species.\") With the virtual certainty of more spills, we need a lot more information on the consequences of these disasters and how we can combat them effectively and efficiently. The U.S. Department of the Interior and the Environmental Protection Agency are making some progress. In coming months, they are releasing changes to regulations and response plans based on the early lessons learned from the Deepwater Horizon spill. But government agencies cannot just rely on the short-term data to determine the best response for the next oil spill crisis. Instead, the government and oil companies should work together to support ongoing, long-term ecological research so that we have a better grasp of what \"normal\" looks like and what factors are important in maintaining those conditions even after a disastrous oil spill. Only then will we truly understand the impact of offshore drilling and the best ways to respond to crises to protect our most important natural resources.\n"]}

Lee Allan Bonneau, 6, died from blunt force trauma to the head in August 2013 following a savage attack on a reservation in Saskatchewan. A 10-year-old boy, identified in court documents as L.T., reportedly admitted to killing Lee Bonneau and crushing his head after initially blaming a stranger for the slaying. Slain: Lee Allan Bonneau was 6 years old when in August 2013 he was attacked by a 10-year-old boy and beaten to death with a rock and a stick . Brief life: Lee was pronounced dead from severe head injuries four hours after he went missing in Saskatchewan, Canada, while in the care of his foster mother . Tribute: A collage created by Lee's biological family celebrating his short, troubled life . On Thursday, a coroner's jury in Regina heard how the underage suspect ran to his friends after the attack on Bonneau telling them he had witnessed a murder, reported National Post. The troubled 10-year-old was described as appearing scared but also excited, telling his friends how a 'big guy' had struck Lee with a stick three times, pushed him down an embankment and then bashed him with a rock. L.T. then changed his story, according to Thursday's hearing, saying the he was the one who killed the 6-year-old. He then pleaded with his pals, 'Don't tell on me,' because he was afraid of being jailed. During an interview with investigators a day after Lee Bonneau's slaying August 21, 2013, L.T. reverted back to his original version of events, telling Royal Canadian Mounted Police that a 'big person' committed the crime. The 10-year-old named the purported killer and told law enforcement officials that he even walked up to the man and asked him what he was doing. 'I'm just killing a little boy,' L.T. quoted the man as saying. Police later questioned the person identified by L.T. and cleared him of any wrongdoing. On the evening of August 21, 2013, Lee Bonneau accompanied his foster mother, Mary Ramstead, to a bingo game at the Kahkewistahaw First Nation hall. At around 8pm, Lee stepped outside the bingo venue to buy snacks and never returned. He was last seen playing with some dogs and walking in the company of an older boy, later identified as 10-year-old L.T. More than two hours after his disappearance, Lee was found critically injured in a remote field more than half a mile from the bingo hall. A coroner's inquest has heard how a 10-year-old boy named L.T. attacked the younger child, pictured here as an infant on the evening of August 21, 2013 on a reservation . Family troubles: Lee was removed from the home of his biological mother, Stacey Merk (pictured) just two and a half months before his murder . Lee is pictured here with his birth father, Dave Bonneau. Child servers reportedly refused to release the 6-year-old into his parent's care . The 6-year-old was rushed to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead from his injuries at around midnight. Forensic pathologist Dr Shaun Ladhman determined that Lee died from blunt force trauma to the left side of the head after suffering multiple skull fractures. In his testimony at the coroner's inquest Thursday, Ladhman compared the boy's injuries to those seen in high-speed car collisions or a three-story fall. Bonneau also had bite marks on his body. Because of his young age, 10-year-old L.T. has not been charged with Lee Bonneau's murder. Global News reported that Saskatchewan\u2019s children\u2019s advocate determined the underage killer had severe behavioral issues and likely required constant supervision. RCMP Cpl. Donna Zawislak testified court that when officers came to the child's house and said that Lee Bonneau has died, the 10-year-old did not react. The following day, L.T. sat down for a forensic interview, saying he had been a witness to the killing, not the perpetrator. When asked about the blood stains on his clothes and shoes, the 10-year-old blamed it on a nosebleed. The child had a history of troubling behavior, including a break-in where he killed a pregnant dog and her puppies, which had been cut out of the animal's body. Lee had been removed from the home of his biological mother, Stacey Merk, just two and a half months before his death citing concerns related to his verbal skills and behavioral problems. Violent end: A pathologist testified that 6-year-old Lee suffered injuries often observed in high-speed car collisions. He had multiple skull fractures and bite marks on his body . Lies:\u00a0The troubled 10-year-old was described as appearing scared but also, telling his friends after the killing how a 'big guy' had struck Lee . Unpunished:\u00a0L.T. will not face any charges in connection to Lee Bonneau's death because of his young age . During the coroner\u2019s inquest, Ms Merk testified that a social worker became alarmed when she confided in her that she has been struggling with depression and had suicidal thoughts. On August 1, child services placed Lee with Mary Ramstead's family on a temporary basis. Three weeks later, the 6-year-old was murdered while in the care of his foster mother. L.T. will not face any charges in connection to Lee Bonneau's death because of his young age. The goal of the coroner's inquest is to determine the circumstances of the murder and make recommendations to prevent similar tragedies going forward.\n"]}

Paul Downton was brave enough to make huge decisions in his first 14 months as England\u2019s managing director but the jury is still out on all of them at a time as the clamour for change has grown louder. It was Downton who made the big call to sack Kevin Pietersen and reappoint Peter Moores as England coach. Paul Downton has left his role as managing director of England and Wales Cricket Board . The move came a day ahead of an ECB board meeting that was meant to discuss the future of Downton . OCTOBER 2013 . Downton, a former England wicketkeeper, is appointed managing sirector of England and Wales Cricket Board, with his position taking effect from February 1, 2014. FEBRUARY 2014 . After the Ashes whitewash, Kevin Pietersen and head coach Andy Flower are sacked. After days of silence, the official line on Pietersen\u2019s dismissal is that the ECB wanted to \u2018create a culture\u2019 in which captain Alastair Cook had \u2018the full support of all players\u2019. MARCH 2014 . England suffer a humiliating 45-run defeat to Holland in the World T20. Ravi Bopara top-scored for England with just 18. APRIL 2014 .

England lose the second Test against India, but come back to win the home series 3-1. In the fifth Test, England inflict upon India their third heaviest defeat in history. DECEMBER 2014 . Cook is sacked as one-day captain and replaced by Eoin Morgan, marking the end of a sorry year for England in which they won just 18 of their 48 matches across all formats. FEBRUARY-MARCH 2015 . England endure a dreadful World Cup campaign, failing to advance from the group stage and finishing behind Bangladesh, who sealed their exit with a 15-run victory. APRIL 2015 . Downton departs as ECB managing director. The ECB are to create a new role of \u2018director of England Cricket\u2019 ahead of the Ashes series. He also had to back the decision to replace Alastair Cook as one-day captain on the brink of the World Cup even though it was the selectors who drove it. But, most of all, it is England\u2019s humiliating World Cup that led the 14 members of the ECB management board to unanimously back the sacking of Downton when new chief executive Tom Harrison rang them on Wednesday morning. So acute was the embarrassment at England going out in the first round of the World Cup that any hopes Downton had for an extended stay in office proved impossible. To the new regime he had to go. \u2018Hugh Morris (his predecessor) stayed in the background but Paul became far too high-profile,\u2019 one board member told Sportsmail on Wednesday night. \u2018He was always on the outfield before games. The bottom line is that he was just too accident prone.\u2019 Downton is the most high-profile casualty so far of that new broom sweeping through English cricket, led by Harrison and chairman-elect Colin Graves but he will not be the last, unless England are successful in their busiest of all years. James Whitaker, the national selector, is the most vulnerable, not least because a change of job description for Downton\u2019s successor to director of England cricket looks likely to make the new man an all-round supremo. Moores and captain Alastair Cook now need to beat the West Indies in the three-Test series starting in Antigua on Monday if they are to feel secure. They must then carry on winning when they face New Zealand, Australia, Pakistan and South Africa over the next 10 months in Test cricket alone. Whether this makes a difference to Pietersen\u2019s future remains to be seen. Clearly the removal of the man who sacked him and an ECB chairman Giles Clarke who was firmly against Pietersen must increase the odds on one of the most unlikely comebacks in sport history happening this summer. Much may depend on who replaces Downton because there is still no real appetite within the ECB, and certainly not among senior members of the England team, for Pietersen to return. His best chance may be if Michael Vaughan is appointed by a man he is known to be close to in Graves. The former England captain  said on Wednesday that he would like to talk to the ECB about the role. Vaughan was the England captain who brought the best from Pietersen, admittedly when he was young and far less likely to cause trouble, and has made no secret of his encouragement for his return. Yet Vaughan, a constant critic of Downton and Moores, has a myriad of interests, both cricketing and otherwise, that he presumably must shelve if he is to return to the ECB now. A more likely scenario is for another former England captain in Andrew Strauss to take up a role that would appear made for him. There were many at the ECB who wanted Strauss to succeed Morris, not least the Welshman himself, but he ruled it out at the time, saying it was too soon after the end of his playing career. Since then he has dabbled in commentary with Sky but may now think the time is right for what seems a natural progression to administration. Downton's job description has been abolished as a result following England's dismal World Cup showing . Downton leaves his role as ECB managing director following England's shameful performance at World Cup . Former England captain Michael Vaughan  said on Wednesday he would like to talk to the ECB about the role . Kevin Pietersen (left) could return for England while\u00a0Andrew Strauss (right) is another that could take the role . Pietersen was uncharacteristically coy when asked on Twitter for his thoughts on Downton\u2019s departure . Alec Stewart is another candidate who, presumably, would have a more open mind about recalling Pietersen as he has just re-signed him for Surrey. He is the third man on the most likely three-man short-list. The best brains in English cricket are undoubtedly Hussain and Atherton so Harrison and Graves should be doing all they possibly can to encourage one of them to return to the national cause. Hussain has already refused and it is extremely unlikely Atherton would be tempted either. Downton has become a derided character but he does not deserve to be the figure of ridicule he has become as frustration has grown at the national team. He was a respected wicketkeeper-batsman with England who had to play much of his Test cricket against the West Indies at their peak and was widely admired for his bravery and gutsy character. His return to cricket after a career in the City came at a time when Morris assured him that everything was in place for a bright future. England\u2019s catastrophic collapse in Australia changed everything. The decision to ditch Pietersen was, as far as I am concerned, absolutely right while Moores may yet prove to be the coach Downton and others believe him to be. But a fall-guy was needed for the World Cup and Downton was the obvious candidate. It remains to be seen how many follow.

Moores (from left to right), Downton and England captain Alastair Cook during the press conference . Downton speaks with Sir Ian Botham  at Lord's Cricket Ground on May 31, 2014 . Meanwhile, here in Basseterre, Jonny Bairstow picked a bad day to remind England that he is a player of real potential despite being jettisoned after the winter\u2019s Ashes disaster. England\u2019s decision to turn their second warm-up game into a practice session saw Bairstow, Jonathan Trott, Gary Ballance and Joe Root bat for an extremely weak St Kitts Invitational XI against their own team. Trott fell third ball to Jimmy Anderson, fending a ball outside off stump to third slip, while Ballance still looked out of touch in being dismissed for 17. Yet Bairstow, the back-up keeper on this tour, made the most of his chance to score 98 before falling to the impressive Ben Stokes. There was an early worry when Stuart Broad slipped in his delivery stride and fell clutching his ankle. He went off for treatment but later returned to bowl and looked no worse for the accident. Root was also struck flush on the helmet fielding at short leg but came out later to bat for St Kitts. England will bat for the whole of Thursday before leaving for Monday\u2019s first Test in Antigua. Alastair Cook . Downton was a supporter of Cook as Test captain but was persuaded to sack him as one-day captain three weeks before the disastrous World Cup campaign. The new \u2018Director of England cricket\u2019 might think Cook needs to go back to scoring runs at the top of the order after failing to convince as a tactician . Verdict: Vulnerable . Alastair Cook was suppoerted by Downton before being sacked as one-day captain before the World Cup . James Whitaker . The chairman of selectors and former Leicestershire captain has been involved in one of the grimmest periods in English cricket.

An atrocious World Cup heaped even more pressure on the coach, whose reappointment last year by Downton has been mitigated only by last summer\u2019s Test series win against India.

Peter Moores\u2019 position is now as weak as it has been following Downton's dismissal at the ECB . Kevin Pietersen . It is almost inconceivable that barely six months after publishing one of the most vitriolic books in the history of sport, this high-maintenance player could be on the brink of a return. But Downton\u2019s removal, and Giles Clarke\u2019s departure, means the path is now clear for Pietersen if he scores runs for Surrey. Verdict: Return possible . Kevin Pietersen's path is now clear to return if he scores runs for Surrey and he tweeted just as much .\n"]}

After a 62-mile (100km) trek through the Thai jungle, Me-Bai, the small elephant can be seen nuzzling her mother, Mae Yui, while the pair joyfully flap their ears and caress each other with their trunks  in the Elephant Nature Park sanctuary, in the north of the country. Me-Bai was sold to provide rides for tourists in Thailand when she was three-and-a-half years old, and didn't see her mother, who also worked in the trade, for three years. Scroll down for video . It would appear to be true that an elephant never forgets, based on a touching video showing an Asian elephant returning to her mother after years apart (pictured) It is particularly sad because females tend to stick together in herds until they die, sharing incredibly strong bonds. They are very rarely separated before the calf is five years of age. The small elephant left the tourism trade 'because she [Me-Bai] was too young [and] began to lose weight and could not carry the tourists any longer,' according to Elephant News'\u00a0YouTube page. Me-Bai was recently rescued and brought to the sanctuary after a tiring 62 mile (100km) trek in the hot sun that lasted four days. The small elephant was sold to provide rides for tourists in Thailand when she was three-and-a-half years old, and didn't see her mother, who also worked in the trade, for three years. They are pictured here togeher . Asian elephants remember old friends and have large social networks of friends, a 2011 study found. Researchers claimed that just like humans, some elephants are social butterflies, while other prefer to stick to a close-knit group of friends. Past studies suggested elephants usually live in small groups centred around females and their young while adult males live independently. However, the study found that though males do live apart, females and their young actually have the sort of complex network of friends, relatives and acquaintances normally seen in humans. Study author Dr Shermin de Silva from the University of Pennsylvania said: 'Elephants are able to track one another over large distances by calling to each other and using their sense of smell. 'So the 'herd' of elephants one sees at any given time is often only a fragment of a much larger social group. 'Our work shows that they are able recognise their friends and renew these bonds even after being apart for a long time.' 'Me-Bai was nervous and wary of people when she first arrived at the sanctuary, but she quickly learned that her new caretakers had no intention of abusing her in any way,' the sanctuary writes. She was initially wary of humans but quickly adjusted to her new surroundings,\u00a0National Geographic reported. Workers learned that Me-Bai's mother was working in the tourist industry nearby and its owners agreed to retire Mae Yui so she could join her young at the sanctuary. The emotional moment the pair were reunited was captured on camera. It shows the elephants caressing each other with their trunks and flapping their ears \u2013 seemingly in joy - after spending an uncertain half an hour together where the keepers thought they may be worried about being separated again. A previous study conducted at the park by Mahidol University in Thailand and Emory University in the US, found that elephants comfort each other when they are stressed by chirping softly and stroking each other's heads and genitals. These actions can be seen in the video. Psychologist and elephant behaviour expert, Preston Foerder, of the University of Tennessee, said the elephants are communicating with touch, as well as sound and sight, because their trunks are so sensitive. The duo can be seen walking and eating together happily, later in the video. After a 62-mile (100km) trek through the Thai jungle, Me-Bai, the small calf can be seen nuzzling her mother, Mae Yui, and joyfully flapping her ears in the Elephant Nature Park sanctuary in the north of the country . However, animal behaviour expert Frans de Waal of Emory University, said that it's possible the elephants don't remember each other, but are just a compatible pair. 'There is no doubt about elephant feelings and bonding, but we humans like to read the mother-child relation into this,' he said. 'It is possible the two remember each other but the video itself does not necessarily prove this.' Whatever the case, the sanctuary says: 'Now, Mae Yui's owners and Elephant Nature Park are working together to rehabilitate Mae Yui and Me-Bai so that they can return to the wild and live free.' Me-Bai was recently rescued and brought to the sanctuary after an exhausting 62 mile (100km) trek in the hot sun that lasted four days. Here the pair walk towards each other at the sanctuary . Workers learned that Me-Bai's mother was working in the tourist industry nearby and its owners agreed to retire Mae Yui so she could join her young at the sanctuary .\n"]}

Carwyn Scott-Howell got lost on the slopes and left the piste before walking through a treacherously steep wooded area, according to a source. The Welsh schoolboy, who was formally named by police today, was holidaying in the French resort of Flaine with his mother Ceri, elder brother Gerwyn, 19, and nine-year-old sister Antonia when the accident took place. A seven-year-old British boy has died after getting separated from his parents on a family skiing holiday in the French resort of Flaine near Geneva (pictured above). He fell down a 160ft cliff after trying to find his parents . Police are still trying to piece together the tragic sequence of events, but they believe the little boy was killed instantly in the fall on Friday after leaving the marked ski slope to look for his family. Investigators are unsure how he came to be at the top of the steep 320ft-high cliff, which overshadows the Lac de Flaine. One theory is that he wandered away from a blue run to try to find his family, while there has also been speculation that he may have fallen off one of the ski resort's lifts. His frantic family began searching for him at around 4pm. They scoured the piste and, increasingly worried, alerted the piste patrol who launched a search. At around 6pm search and rescue workers discovered his tracks in the snow leading through woodland up to the top of the cliff, where they found his abandoned skis. He was then spotted by rescuers in a helicopter, and they recovered his body at around 7.30pm from the bottom of the cliff. The area was described as a 'dangerous, out-of-bounds area' by emergency services, who said rescuers had to be winched down from a helicopter to retrieve the body. The conditions in the French ski resort of Flaine (pictured) were clear and sunny but it is believed the boy ventured off-piste while trying to find his parents. Police found tracks in the snow which led to his body . Michel Ollagnon, an officer with the Bonneville mountain rescue service, told reporters that the boy had been skiing with his mother, brother and sister, but he had asked to ski alone for his last descent of the day. He said the boy had then fallen off a rocky outcrop after apparently losing his way. Police chief Patrick Poirot, the head of the mountain rescue division in Annecy, added: 'His family were on the piste and then they could not see him. 'They looked for him but couldn't see him anywhere on the piste. They went to the piste patrol and said: 'Our child has disappeared' and a search was started. 'At about 6pm some tracks were discovered in the snow. It was in a very dangerous, out-of-bounds area. The tracks led to the little boy's skis. 'They were there in the snow at the top of a cliff. It was very dangerous. The piste patrol could not go down the cliff. So they called a helicopter but it could not land. They spotted the boy and rescuers were then winched down but the child was dead. It was now about 7.30pm.' He added: 'Hypothetically we think that the little boy didn't know where to go and skied in the wrong direction. He's just seven years old. 'He left the marked ski slope and probably skied to the top of a cliff. He then stopped, removed his skis, walked a little way and then fell. 'He fell 50 metres. Specialists are now at the scene to try and determine exactly what happened and understand every element that led to this tragedy.' Resort boss Sylvain Philippe, director of the Societe du Domaine Skiable de Flaine, said: 'The whole resort has been affected by the death of this young boy. We are thinking above all of his family. 'An enquiry into his death has started to find out the exact circumstances of what happened. Unfortunately and sadly they confirmed that his body was found off piste in an area of the resort called Aujon. 'He was very far from the piste, it's not a skiable area. He was unfortunately found in the middle of the cliffs, everyone has been very affected by it. 'We're working with the police and the family on this and we will be helping the family for as long as they need.' Carwyn's mother Ceri lives with her husband Rhys in the Brecon Beacons where the pair run the award-winning Coity Bach Farm near Talybont-on-Usk. The farm rents out its 'four-star gold award' self-catering cottages to visitors and is well known for its prize-winning speciality sausages. David Cameron was once pictured buying scotch eggs from the couple's stand at an agricultural show in Wales in July 2014. On the Coity Bach website it tells how ex-nurse Ceri and former butcher Rhys bought the farm to live out their dream of growing their own food and living 'the good life'. Last night, relatives at the farm were too upset to speak, but a neighbour told of the village's shock. 'It's extremely sad \u2013 they are a loving family and he was a smashing lad,' said one neighbour, who did not want to be named. They went on to say: 'I haven't even broken the news to my own children yet, it's just too shocking.' Another added: 'Ceri is a great mum and they're well-loved in the village. We will all rally round her when they return from France.' An assistant from Ski Set, a shop in the resort where the family had hired some of their equipment, said: 'They loved skiing. They said that they had been to lots of ski resorts before. 'They were a very nice family. The little boy seemed just happy to be on holiday. They had been on holiday for a week. He was good enough for a seven-year-old. He wasn't a beginner.'\n"]}

But astronomers say 'rogue', sun-less planets that wander the stars  could still harbour extra-terrestrials. While it sounds like science fiction, these planets may offer scientists a new avenue in their search for alien life. The warmth of a sun has long been thought to be a key ingredient to life. But astronomers say 'rogue', sun-less planets that wander the stars could still harbour extra-terrestrials . This is according to Sean Raymond, an astrophysicist with the Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux in France, who has taken a look at how life can form on rogue planets. Writing in Aeon, he says: 'To have any chance of life \u2013 at least life like our own \u2013 a free-floating Earth would need liquid water.' A planet needs to keep warm for liquid water to form, and without the sun, this heat would have to come from its interior. 'A layer of ice on a planet's surface can act as a strong insulator, locking in a planet's heat,' claims Raymond. Globulettes - regions of dust and gas that can form planets - could make rogue more common than first thought.\u00a0Rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star . PSO J318.5-22 was detected 80 light years away from Earth and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of Jupiter . Several years ago, an\u00a0international team of astronomers discovered a large planet floating freely through space with no star to orbit. Planets traditionally travel in a uniform, singular direction, around a star. However, the free-floating planet, named PSO J318.5-22, was found without a host. Its movement isn't structured, and scientists do not understand how it formed and they are baffled by what - if anything - controls it. PSO J318.5-22 was detected 80 light years away from Earth and it is estimated to have a mass six times that of Jupiter. Astronomers believe it formed 12 million years ago, and is considered a newborn in planetary terms - Earth is thought to be around 4.5 billion years old. Dr Michael Liu of the Institute for Astronomy at the University of Hawaii identified the rogue planet from its 'faint and unique heat signature'. We have never before seen an object free-floating in space that that looks like this. 'It has all the characteristics of young planets found around other stars, but it is drifting out there all alone,' explained Liu. 'If the ice layer is thick enough, then a planet can maintain an ocean of liquid water beneath the ice.' He calculates that the ice layer needs to be at least 10 km (6 miles) thick to prevent it from freezing for billions of years. Raymonds comments echo a similar conclusion reached by scientists in Chicago several years ago. They calculated that life can cling on to a planet for billions of years without a star to provide a direct source of warmth. Research by astrophysicists Dorian Abbot and Eric Switzer from the city's university discovered that heat would come from the breakdown of radioactive elements inside the planet's core. The scientists named their discovery a 'Steppenwolf' planet because they claimed any life found there would 'exist like a lone wolf wandering the galactic steppe'. However the pair refused to speculate on what life forms would be discovered, but agreed that they would me microscopic in size. As well as internal heat, Raymond says another way a planet can keep warm is using a thick atmosphere. 'A free-floating Earth with a thick hydrogen atmosphere could keep its surface temperature above the freezing point of water,' writes Raymond. 'The planet could have lakes and oceans (and possibly life) on its surface.' Rogue planets are hard to find because, without orbiting a star, they reflect very little light. But 50 have now been found in the past 15 years, leading some to suggest they may be abundant in the universe. Rogue planets are of particular interest to astronomers because they represent objects that have likely failed to form into a star. Brown dwarfs, for example, are substellar objects that are not massive enough to sustain fusion, but are still more than 13 times the mass of Jupiter. The exact boundary between a giant planet and a low-mass brown dwarf is still being debated, but finding more rogue planets could shed light on this mystery. And this could indicate that there are more rogue planets than we know of in the cosmos.\n"]}

She then steers head-on into a truck which rolls over on its side with debris flying everywhere. As the back end of the 18-wheeler swings out, it pushes a red pickup truck off course. Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air. Rivera told\u00a0waxahachietx.com\u00a0that once things came to a standstill he got out of his vehicle to see if he could offer any assistance to the parties involved before authorities arrived. The incident, which occurred just past 6pm, shut the highway for around two hours. Mayeaux, from Waco, Texas, was transported to Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas because of the injuries she sustained during the wreck.

Off course: Footage shows a black SUV coming off at 397 exit and veering over to the wrong side of the lane . Lt. Ron Turbeville, with the Waxahachie police department, said that she was found 'inebriated' and \u00a0'smelling of alcohol' by medics who pulled her from her crushed Chevrolet Suburban. He added: 'Basically, based off that from the attending paramedics and firefighters, there was enough evidence there to suggest that she was drinking. 'That is the reason why we got a warrant for her blood.' After undergoing treatment, Mayeaux apparently admitted to police that she was trying to take her own life. She was released from hospital last Friday. In a puff of smoke: Thick black skid marks can be seen on the tarmac as smoke fills the air .

It is not known if Mayeaux will face charges and the event remains under investigation. Riveria, who caught the near-fatal crash on his camera, said he remains shaken up by what he saw.

PKS is a rare chromosomal disorder which affects about 200 people worldwide and 15 those cases are known to be in Australia, according to the Pallister Killian Syndrome\u00a0Foundation of Australia. It is commonly undiagnosed during pregnancy and is discovered at birth or soon after due to characteristic appearance or other complications such as\u00a0developmental delays, seizures and congenital heart defects. Ms Maitai has told of the heartbreaking moment she learnt about her son's condition. 'I wanted to commit suicide because I thought it was all my fault,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'But then I found myself having to choose whether to escape all this and give up my son or be strong for my children by moving forward and staying with them every step of the way. 'It's been a difficult journey so far but also a blessing because I have found hope in Malakai and I know he will make it through.'

While Ms Maitai juggles her time between the hospital with Malakai and at home with her seven-year-old daughter Serenity, the financial strain of being without a job and dependent on $90 from welfare is taking its toll.

Not having grown up with a proper mother and father figure back in New Zealand, Ms Maitai is determined to give her children the life she never hard. 'I want to be a better parent and I want to be there for my kids,' she said. 'It's just a waiting game with Malakai and the doctors even asked me if I wanted to look after him even with his condition and I said yes. I chose to be there for him and he will make it through - I just know it.' Pallister Killian Syndrome, also known as PKS, is a rare chromosomal disorder.

The hope is that the videos shown to residents of a care home in the city will ease their confusion, forgetfulness and agitation. The idea is borrowed from the 2004 Adam Sandler film 50 First Dates, in which Drew Barrymore's character suffers a brain injury and memory loss each day. A suitor, played by Sandler, uses videos to remind her of him. Charlotte Dell, director of social services at Hebrew Home in Riverdale, said the film was 'fluff', but added it inspired her to think about how the idea could help residents. The film 50 First Dates starring Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore has inspired a new dementia experiment taking place at a care home in Riverdale, New York . 'We're looking to see if we can set a positive tone for the day,' without using drugs, she said. 'What better way to start the day than to see the face and hear the voice of someone you love wishing you a wonderful morning?' As in the film, each day a new video is shown to residents. Relatives are encouraged to take part to say good morning, use memory-triggering personal anecdotes and remind their loved ones that care home staff will be helping them get dressed and ready for the day. People suffering Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia often fell confused and anxious in the morning. The programme is designed to help those who are in the early to moderate stages of dementia, those who are still likely to recognise the people in the video and understand what they are saying. Ms Dell said: 'Do we know for sure that they know, this is my daughter, this is my son? No. 'But they recognise them as somebody they care about and love.' The Hebrew Home is planning to evaluate the programme next month, with the aim of expanding it to several hundred residents in its memory-care 'neighbourhoods'. Ms Dell said anecdotal evidence so far from staff at the home is 'very positive'. Robert Abrams, a geriatric psychiatrist at New York Presbyterian Hospital said the pilot is 'both innovative and thoughtful'. 'You've got a group of people with dementia who don't really grasp the nature and purpose of their surroundings or the circumstances that compelled them to be there,' he said. 'Consequently they're alone and at sea and feel frightened and even abandoned by family.' Resident Louisa Irving, 94, is one of several dementia sufferers at Hebrew Care Home, who is woken up each morning with a video recording from a loved one to help ease confusion and agitation . Her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, pictured in the striped top, records messages including stories of happy memories and family get-togethers, signing off with the family goodbye, 'Kiss, kiss, I love you' Among the residents taking part in the study is 94-year-old dementia sufferer, Louisa Irving. She wakes up each day to a video from her daughter Tamara Rusoff-Hoen, who sings: 'Good morning, merry sunshine, how did you wake so soon?' to her mother. The five-minute video includes stories of happy memories and get-togethers, and often inspires a bright smile from Ms Irving, before her daughter signs off with the family goodbye: 'Kiss, kiss, I love you.' Ms Rusoff-Hoen, said: 'Some of her agitation comes from, \"Who the heck are these people? Why am I here?\".' Although Ms Rusoff-Hoen, who lives a few hours away in Ghent, visits her mother three days a week, she said the video allows her to fill in the gaps. 'I am there with my mum, loving her and wishing her a wonderful day and helping her to feel better because there's not a lot I can do for her.' Other videos include a woman reminding her mother, in Spainish, to eat and take her medications before telling her: 'I love you, mum.' And in another, a man encourages his mother, telling her: 'You used to tell me that attitude is everything. You said that it's best to start off on the sunny side of the street.'\n"]}

Bob Heslip, 50, suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF-1, which is caused by a gene malfunction that causes the bubble-like bumps to appear all over his body. However, he says he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life now that he has joined the Venice Beach Freakshow  where he has met performers including a bearded lady and America's smallest couple. 'When I met the performers, there was a feeling of belonging. I felt at home,' Heslip told The Huffington Post. Scroll down for video . Bob Heslip (pictured), 50, who suffers from Neurofibromatosis type 1, or NF-1, has joined the Venice Beach Freakshow and said for the first time in his life he feels comfortable in his skin . The noncancerous lumps began appearing on his body around puberty and became more severe as he aged . Heslip, who works at a Dollar Tree in Tuscon, said around eight months ago he was on vacation with his family in Los Angeles when they saw the Freakshow, as his daughter is a fan of the TV show. Todd Ray, the owner, saw Heslip and recognized his condition as NF-1 and began talking to him. 'I went to the front, took off my shirt and the crowd went crazy,' Heslip told the Huffington Post. He accepted Ray's offer to join the show as the 'Bubble Boy' a few weeks ago and said it gives him the platform to talk about his condition to people who otherwise just stare. For Heslip, the tumors on his body began appearing around puberty but became more severe as he aged. He noted that when he got married 25 years ago he did not have any bumps on his face, but now he does. 'I don't feel a lot of pain from the bumps,' Heslip told The Huffington Post. 'I have a large bump on the side of my body that used to be very sensitive, but not so much now.' To have the tumors surgically removed is not an option for him as he said it is not guaranteed that they will not grow back or possibly grow back larger than before. Heslip said: 'When I met the performers, there was a feeling of belonging. I felt at home' Staying in hiding from the public is also not an option as he has a family including his wife and children to support. Ray said that some people will see Heslip's hands and will not want him to touch their items while he is working because they think he is contagious. As Heslip manages his job in Tuscon and his new role as a performer, he feels comfortable in his skin for the first time in his life because of the Venice Beach Freakshow. The job which he works on the weekends is also making it possible for him to talk to others about NF-1. 'I want to teach people that it's not taboo to ask questions. I'm OK talking about it,' he told the Huffington Post. 'My son and oldest daughter also have this condition and my speaking out about it gets them excited. They know my attitude is positive.' Heslip joins performers including Asia Ray, Morgue, Jessa the Bearded Lady, Larry the Wolf Boy and Miss Sunshine as part of the Venice Beach Freakshow (pictured above) Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1) is one of the most common inherited neurological disorders affecting around one in every 3,000 people. NF-1 ranges from mild to severe and can cause more symptoms in some people than in others. The condition primarily affects the skin, the nervous system and the eyes, and most people with NF-1 have recognizable signs before the age of 10. The most common symptoms include six or more light brown skin spots (caf\u00e9 au lait spots), freckles in unusual places, such as under the arms and in the groin, colored bumps on the iris (Lisch nodules) and Neurofibromas. Regardless if the NF-1 gene change was inherited from a parent or is newly affected, every person who has an NF-1 gene change has a 50 per cent chance of passing it on every time they have a child. Genetic testing for the NF-1 gene is available and can be coordinated for families in which testing would be appropriate. Source: Johns Hopkins Medicine .\n"]}

No one is dead and buried and even Sunderland in 15th are a bad weekend away from falling into the relegation zone. It\u2019s extremely close with the delightful benefit that there will be five key fixtures between sides in the bottom six. Have Hull got enough breathing room to survive what looks like the hardest run-in? Are Leicester too far back? Burnley have been dealt a reasonable hand but can they capitalise? Have QPR improved enough away from home to take any confidence to Leicester on the final day? Sportsmail considers the possibilities and delivers a verdict. Sunderland . Position: 15th on 29 points . Jermain Defoe (centre) reinvigorated Sunderland with a stunning strike to beat rivals Newcastle 1-0 . Dick Advocaat is overseeing Sunderland's survival bid as manager until the end of the season . Seven points split Sunderland in 15th and Leicester in 20th as the battle for Premier League survival heats up . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Crystal Palace (H) -D . Stoke (A) - D . Southampton (H) - L . Everton (A) - L . Leicester (H) - W . Arsenal (A) - L . Chelsea (A) L . Predicted total: 34 points . Verdict: Safe . Their derby win will have done them the world of good, as will the relative comfort of facing three teams in Palace, Stoke and Everton who have very little to play for. They need to make the most of those initial fixtures because it\u2019s highly unlikely that they will get anything out of closing trips to Arsenal and Chelsea. Aston Villa . Position: 16th on 29 points . Christian Benteke scored a hat-trick as Aston Villa drew 3-3 against Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday . Tim Sherwood has helped Villa rediscover their scoring touch since replacing Paul Lambert as manager . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester City (A) - L . Everton (H) - D . West Ham (H) - W . Southampton (A) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Predicted total: 36 points . Verdict: Safe . At this stage of the season and in these circumstances you want winnable home games and that is what Villa have. However, with only three home wins this season (one less than on the road) they face a challenge. They ought to be OK, not least because a team that struggled to score under Paul Lambert has improved under Tim Sherwood. Hull . Position: 17th on 28 points . Steve Bruce's Hull  are placed perilously above the drop zone in 17th with seven games remaining . Ahmed Elmohamady will be a key man in Hull's bid to protect their position outside of the relegation zone . Predicted results: Five points from seven games . Southampton (A) - L . Liverpool (H) - D . Crystal Palace (A) - D . Arsenal (H) - L . Burnley (H) - W . Tottenham (A) - L . Manchester United (H) - L . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Safe. On goal difference. The hardest run-in of the lot? It looks that way and therefore they could cut it awfully fine with regards to survival. There are two points between them and QPR at the moment, but Hull could have a potentially decisive advantage in the form of their goal difference, which is six better than QPR\u2019s. Their fixtures are simply awful. Crystal Palace are isolated on that list as a team without major incentive. QPR . Position: 18th on 26 points . Charlie Austin has netted 17 goals in 29 games for QPR and will be vital during his team's difficult run-in . Chris Ramsey may find QPR's goal difference a big disadvantage, particularly with a tough final seven games . Predicted results: Seven points from six games . Chelsea (H) - L . West Ham (H) - W . Liverpool (A) - L . Man City (A) - L . Newcastle (H) - W . Leicester (A) - D . Predicted total: 33 points . Verdict: Relegated on goal difference . Three brutally hard fixtures with perhaps a mixed blessing that Liverpool and Manchester City \u2013 games you would expect them to lose anywhere \u2013 are played away. That places huge emphasis on home games against West Ham and Newcastle, neither of whom are in form nor have much to play for. It could all come down to the final game of the season, which is away at Leicester. Chris Ramsey has improved their away form but it is a big ask. Their poor goal difference in relation to Hull\u2019s could be the deciding factor. Burnley . Position: 19th on 26 points . Danny Ings will spearhead Burnley's attack as they attempt to escape the Premier League relegation zone . Sean Dyche's side have two relegation crunch matches away from home against Hull and Villa . Predicted results: Six points from seven games . Arsenal (H) \u2013 L . Everton (A) - D . Leicester (H) \u2013 W . West Ham (A) - D . Hull (A) - L . Stoke (H) - D . Aston Villa (A) - L . Predicted total: 32 points . Verdict: Relegated . On paper they probably have the most straightforward opponents, but have the misfortune of playing two of their most critical fixtures \u2013 against Hull and Villa \u2013 away from Turf Moor. They have won only once away all season so it would be extremely ambitious to expect them to make hay now, considering four of those seven fixtures are on the road. Would expect their status to be decided by the final two games. Leicester . Position: 20th on 22 points . Esteban Cambiasso celebrates after an impressive display helped Leicester beat West Ham 2-1 on Saturday . Nigel Pearson (left) has eight games remaining to get Leicester safe and has five home games to play . Predicted results: Four points from eight games . West Brom (A) - L . Swansea (H) - D . Burnley (A) - L . Chelsea (H) - L . Newcastle (H) - D . Southampton (H) - D . Sunderland (A) - L . QPR (H) - D . Predicted total: 26 points . Verdict: Relegated . As with Burnley, it\u2019s not the most intimidating run-in and they do have the most games from which to gain points. They also have the slight advantage of five fixtures at home. But 22 points from 30 games so far offers little indication that they will mount any kind of sprint for the line.\n"]}

Friday is also Sukumaran's 34th birthday which could well be his last as the pair contemplate the prospect of facing a firing squad\u00a0on Execution Island in Java. The talented artist's birthday is being marked in London where his cousin has organised\u00a0an exhibition of his paintings at the\u00a0Amnesty International headquarters. Meanwhile, the pair are in an isolated cell pinning their hopes on yet another legal quest for mercy which rests with a court that has previously recommended an option of a life sentence for reformed inmates. Myuran Sukumaran has put all of his energy into his art while spending 10 years in Kerobokan jail . His cousin\u00a0Niranjela Karunatilake is currently holding an exhibition of his artwork in London . Sukumaran (left) and Andrew Chan (right) await their fate on Execution Island in Java - exactly a decade after they were arrested . The pair were identified as leaders of the plot to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin, taped to the bodies of young mules, on April 17, 2005, and sentenced to death. Since they were refused clemency earlier this year, their lawyers have been desperate to show the courts their rehabilitation over the past decade. Chan is now a pastor and Sukumaran a painter, and both had a hugely positive impact on fellow inmates at Kerobokan jail. Sukumaran's skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives. Painting has proven a great sense of solace for Sukumaran during his time in jail and has even run art classes for fellow inmates as part of the drug rehabilitation program that he set up with Chan. His cousin, Niranjela Karunatilake, last visited her cousin on death row in February. Niranjela said it was: ' just too sad to think that could be his last birthday'. 'The death penalty is never the answer and I don't believe it deters crime, but in Myu's case, when he has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short,' she said. 'We are not asking for Myu to be freed, all we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life and continues his positive impact on the Indonesian prison system and other inmates.' Friday is also Sukumaran's 34th birthday which could well be his last as the pair contemplate the prospect of facing a firing squad on Execution Island in Java . Karunatilake said\u00a0his skill has developed over the past four years and she can see him finding himself in his paintings . His cousin Niranjela said it was: ' just too sad to think that could be his last birthday' Sukumaran's skill and love for his art grew as he was mentored by well-known Australian artist Ben Quilty - who has also led the charge in the mercy campaign to save the pair's lives . Their Melbourne barrister Julian McMahon visited the men last week, and says they are well. As he waits for the constitutional court to respond to a new bid to challenge the clemency process, Mr McMahon recalls the court's 2007 recommendation on the death penalty. While it upheld its constitutional validity, the court recommended that death row prisoners who showed rehabilitation after 10 years had the option of being re-sentenced to a fixed term. 'There's absolutely no doubt my two clients have done a heroic job in reforming themselves and many others,' Mr McMahon said. 'I see that as an opportunity to enliven the constitutional court jurisprudence.' President Joko Widodo refused clemency to the men citing a 'drugs emergency' but has the authority to reverse the decision. No date has been fixed for the executions of the Sydney men and eight other drug offenders, but officials say they're considering a date after the Asian African Conference ends on April 24. 'We are not asking for Myu to be freed, all we ask is for mercy, that he keeps his life and continues his positive impact on the Indonesian prison system and other inmates,' Niranjela said . Sukumaran taught inmates how to paint as part of the drug rehabilitation program he set up with Chan . Niranjela said her cousin has done so much to repent and improve prison conditions, it would be a real tragedy if his life was cut short' \u201cIt\u2019s clear painting has been a vital comfort for him on death row,'\u00a0Niranjela said .

'It was dim, the movie was still playing, the alarm was going off,' Aurora police officer Annette Brook told jurors in the trial of gunman James Holmes. 'I began to notice the bodies, the live victims, the blood.' Prosecutors called Brook and two other officers as witnesses on Wednesday, and their descriptions of the chaos of inside the suburban Denver theater intensified the already disturbing scene described a day earlier by moviegoers who were badly wounded or saw loved ones gunned down in the July 20, 2012, attack. Scroll down for video . The third day of the trial against suspected Aurora, Colorado movie theater shooter James Holmes continued on Wednesday. If convicted, Holmes could be sentenced to death. Pictured above in court on Monday, far left . Twelve people were killed and 70 hurt when Holmes allegedly opened fire on a packed theater in Aurora, Colorado for a midnight showing of The Dark Knight Rises in July 2012. Above, the scene of the theater after the shooting . Twelve people died and 70 were wounded. Holmes is charged with multiple counts of murder and attempted murder. He admits he was the shooter, his defense attorneys say, but schizophrenia had taken control of his mind and compelled him to kill. His lawyers are asking the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity, which would send him to the state mental hospital indefinitely. Prosecutors argue Holmes was sane and fully aware that what he was doing was wrong. They want the jury to convict him and sentence him to die. Holmes' defense attorneys want the jury to find him not guilty by reason of insanity. Prosecutors say Holmes knew what he was doing, however. On the left, a sketch of Holmes in court on Monday and and 2012 mugshot on the right . In the opening days of the trial, prosecutors have appeared intent on planting a deeply upsetting image in the jurors' minds. 'It smelled very, very bad,' officer Tomas Campagna testified Wednesday, describing the mixed odors of blood, sweat, urine and feces. 'It's hard to imagine unless you've been there.' Spent cartridges and casings from a shotgun, a rifle and a handgun littered the ground, so thick that officers couldn't avoid stepping on them, Campagna said. In places, the floor looked like it had been painted in blood, he said. Cellphones left behind by the victims rang far into the night. More victims testified Wednesday, describing the booms and the brilliant flashes of light that burst from the muzzles of the weapons aimed at them and the hot pain of being shot. One of those victims was Joshua Nowlan, a former member of the military who worked on aircraft carriers. He went to the movie, 'The Dark Knight Rises,' at the Century 16 multiplex in the Denver suburb of Aurora with friends who had just returned from their honeymoon in Florida. About 15 or 20 minutes into the film, a tear gas canister was thrown into the theater, and then the shooting started. Nowlan, who shielded his friends from the bullets, was shot twice and has undergone multiple surgeries. He used the cane he now needs to walk to show jurors what he saw next. 'I assumed it had to be the shooter, from his stance ... He was walking around, and I can see him pointing the gun in a circular motion that looked like he was searching for more people ... I was terribly scared,' Nowlan told the court. 'My thought process was that he was searching for other people and that he was going to start going row by row, and that anybody he would see in that row who was still moving, he would shoot.' He described the shooter firing three-round bursts. Asked if the gunman moved fast or methodically, Nowlan said: 'He was definitely moving slowly.' None of the victims said they saw Holmes' face, but one of the police officers did. Sgt. Spc. Gerald Jonsgaard testified he saw Holmes lying on the ground in the parking lot outside the theater as two officers arrested him. Jonsgaard didn't identify Holmes by name Wednesday but said he was sitting at the defense table. Holmes' lawyers have not cross-examined any prosecution witnesses. They will call their own witnesses after the prosecution rests.\n"]}

Supporters from both clubs say they are 'disgusted' at the continuing rise of ticket prices, with the protest coming in the aftermath of the announcement of the Premier League's \u00a35.14billion TV rights deal with banners held up inside and outside the ground. With tickets at the sold-out Emirates starting from \u00a364 for the 12.45pm kick-off, protesters hope the image of empty seats around the ground will raise awareness of the struggles fans face to meet the rising costs of following their clubs. Fans inside the Emirates Stadium display a banner reading: '\u00a35bn and what do we get? \u00a364 a ticket' The cheapest tickets for the lunchtime kick-off were \u00a364, some of the highest prices in the Premier League . Supporters of both sides gathered outside the 60,000-capacity stadium before kick-off to show off banners against the rising costs of modern football. A banner inside the stadium, held between the home and away ends, read: '\u00a35bn and what do we get? \u00a364 a ticket'. Ahead of the game, Kelvin Meadows of Arsenal's Black Scarf Movement - who organised the event with Liverpool's\u00a0Spirit of Shankly and Spion Kop 1906 fan groups - called ticket prices 'extortionate'.

'I was pregnant with Elijah when I found out that I had breast cancer, so it was a bit scary wondering what was going to happen with the pregnancy and the other kids,' Ms Van Santen told Daily Mail Australia. After undergoing a specific chemotherapy regime which had been found to have no negative impact on unborn children, and having a mastectomy, her son was born happy and most importantly, healthy. 'He had a full head of hair when he was born, and I was bald so that made me feel better,' Ms Van Santen, who is from Perth, joked. Singe mother-of-five Clare Van Santen, 37, (back of image) is currently battling terminal breast cancer. She is pictured here with her four youngest kids\u00a0Susan 17, Nikita, 14, Jack, 12, Elijah, 9, . The Perth woman was first diagnosed when she was pregnant with her fifth child, Elijah, now aged nine . When she asked her doctor after all her treatment whether she was in remission, he told her that with breast cancer, if it is contained within the breast like hers was, you are essentially cured. But ten years on, after living a life which she thought was cancer-free, the single mum-of-five has been told her cancer is now terminal. Her biggest concern going forward is for her children, whose ages range from 20 to nine years old, and how they will live without her. 'I worry about how they\u2019re going to be and who\u2019s going to look after them, what\u2019s going to happen, how they\u2019re going to cope,' Ms Van Santen said. After her initial diagnosis, the Perth woman learned in October 2013 her cancer had spread to her liver, and she also had a small amount in one of her shoulders. 'I went to have lap-band surgery and they did a scan of my liver and found some legions which ended up being cancer, little tiny bit in my shoulder too,' Ms Van Santen revealed. Ms Van Santen has a bucket list of things she wants to do with her children: Keisha, 20, Susan 17, Nikita, 14, Jack, 12, Elijah, 9, in the time she has left . She was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2005, but it has since spread to her liver, shoulder, and brain . The 37-year-old has undergone coutnless chemotherapy and radiation treatments in the past decade . Instead of the surgery she was supposed to have, she had to endure five months of chemotherapy and hormone treatments, which successfully shrunk the spots in her liver. 'For most people a Bucket List is something that has lots of adventurous things on it...\u00a0My Bucket List is for me and my kids, so they can enjoy their home environment and that we can make as many happy memories as possible while I can.' - Clare Van Santen. Some of the items on the mother-of-five's list include: . Then at the beginning of this year, Ms Van Santen began having some strange symptoms once again. 'I'd been having headaches and just forgetting things, and sometimes I'd read something and the worlds had been jumbled around. 'On\u00a0February 14 I had a seizure and discovered the cancer had gone to my brain,' she revealed, saying the horrible event happened in front of three of her kids. Radiation therapy is currently trying to shrink the ten tumors spread throughout her brain, but the cancer is inoperable, and devastatingly, terminal. As for how much time Ms Van Santen has left with her children, it's impossible to know. 'They can\u2019t say,' she said, speaking of her doctors. 'They've said a few months to a few years.' Ms Van Santen has a bucket list of things she hopes to do, see and experience with her family before her time is up, but life is much harder for her than it used to be. With the time she has left she hopes to makeover the kids' rooms so they have their own sanctuary, get a 'HUGE comfortable leather lounge for me and kids to sit on, so I can be with them', and fix up other things around the house. Ms Van Santen also wants to go on a family holiday on a cruise, have a photo-shoot with her kids, and simply 'make lots of little moments special'. She has thrown her support behind Breast Cancer Care's Buying Time campaign which aims to raise money to fund more breast cancer nurses . Ms Van Santen, pictured here with eldest daughter Keisha, is not sure how much time she has left with her kids . And perhaps the most important: 'Finding someone who will love my kids nearly as much as I do!'. But the medication she currently on makes her more exhausted than 'I've ever been in my life', and leaves her wiped out for days at a time. However the mum-of-five said her life would be even more difficult if she didn't have the support of Breast Cancer Care, WA. She has thrown her support behind the Buying Time Campaign, which aims to raise money which will go towards funding more breast cancer nurses and support services. 'I've rung them crying so many times,' Ms Van Santen revealed. 'Their\u00a0support is so, so amazing.' When a patient first receives their diagnosis and calls the care centre, they are allocated a nurse who helps them through their entire journey. The nurses make house calls, ring and check up on them, send counsellors out to get people through tough times and help patients get connected with support groups. She hopes to take her family on a holiday together, and get a photoshoot with everyone soon . Ms Van Santen also hopes to raise awareness about the mortality rates of women with breast cancer . 'They help with everything, if you need some financial help, or you need legal help, if you need a lift...' Ms Van Santen said. '(And) it\u2019s good to be able to speak to other people going through the same thing,' she added, speaking of the help she received through her Stage 4 support group. Through her involvement in this campaign, Ms Van Santen also wants to help raise awareness about the mortality rates of women who suffer from breast cancer. She has questioned why she is classified as a 'survivor' because she has lived for more than five years after her diagnosis, but will still eventually succumb to the disease. Ms Van Santen said she would like to see more research done on Stage 4, or terminal, breast cancer because even though hers was detected early, it will still eventually take her life. 'So much money goes into awareness for breast cancer, but no money goes into actually researching Stage 4 cancer,' she said, adding that as it's the one that takes lives there should be more known about it. Ms Van Santen hopes in the future there can be more awareness about the mortality rates of the disease, and that people know that even if detected early, that breast cancer can still kill. 'It\u2019s important for so many people, you know, my kids, people's families', she said. You can support the Buying Time campaign here, donate to help Clare Van Santen tick things off her bucket list here, or keep up with her journey here.\n"]}

The charges include assault of a police officer, robbery, resisting police, disobedience to lawful orders, obstructing roadways, and interference. [Previous story, posted at 10:54 p.m. ET] . (CNN) -- In cities across the United States, marchers took to the streets to show support for protesters in Baltimore and to complain about police violence in their own towns. On Wednesday night, several hundred people streamed into Union Square for an \"NYC Rise Up & Shut It Down With Baltimore\" rally. Protesters headed west on 17th Street and were met by New York City Police officers who pushed them back. A small scuffle broke out between the two front lines and police placed at least 20 people in zip ties in the street. The NYPD also handed out fliers and used loudspeakers to tell protesters and pedestrians to stay on the sidewalk. One person was placed in ambulance and taken away. The crowd headed toward Times Square. A law enforcement source told CNN that more than 60 people were arrested during the demonstrations. The rally was organized through social media, much like protests over the killing of Eric Garner, who died while police held him in what appeared to be a chokehold. The demonstrators chanted \"Black Lives Matter\" and \"Justice for Freddie Gray\" -- the Baltimore man whose death sparked street confrontations in Baltimore. CNN affiliate WCBS reported Mayor Bill de Blasio sent a message to the protesters: \"I'd say that if you want to make change, keep things peaceful.\" A smaller rally was held Tuesday in New York. In Washington, about 500 protesters, mostly in their 20s, gathered in the middle of H Street and 7th and chanted, \"All night, all day, we're gonna fight for Freddie Gray.\" The mood seemed more festive than confrontational, with songs by Public Enemy like \"Fight the Power\" playing and sign-language interpreters translating the music and chants. The protest moved to the White House where most of the crowd dispersed. It started after most office workers had headed home and didn't disrupt the Washington workforce badly. One of the groups involved in the protest is the DC Ferguson Movement. Organizer Eugene Puryear said the march was called to show solidarity with the residents in Baltimore and to highlight that police brutality is a national issue. Several hundred people gathered in Gold Medal Park in Minneapolis for a rally organized by the group of #BlackLivesMatter. The Minneapolis group  held similar events in the past in response to alleged police brutality across the country. Protests also were held in Boston and Houston. On Tuesday, violent protests took place in Ferguson, Missouri, where three people were shot, the city police reported. Police said they didn't do the shooting. A 20-year-old man was arrested and the three victims were in stable condition -- two with wounds to the neck, one in the leg, police said. Police said about 300 people marched, with protesters throwing rocks at police, damaging four police cars and setting trash and debris on fire near Northwinds Estates and West Florissant, police said. One business in Dellwood was damaged, police said. No officers were injured as police conducted anti-riot activities until 3 a.m. In Los Angeles, six people protesting against police brutality were arrested Monday night when they failed to disperse, reported CNN affiliate KABC. About 50 people marched, KABC said. On Tuesday, protesters gathered outside the Stapes Center, where the Los Angeles Clippers and the San Antonio Spurs were playing an NBA playoff game. They disrupted traffic and carried protest signs. In Chicago, hundreds of protesters marched Tuesday from police headquarters at 35th and Michigan through the Southside, CNN affiliate WGN reported. Police made one arrest, for reckless conduct. WGN said protesters spoke about police violence and the death of Rekia Boyd, who was killed by an off-duty officer in 2012. That officer was acquitted last week. The group plans to gather Wednesday night at the DePaul Law School. About 100 people marched Monday night in Oakland in support of Baltimore protesters, reported CNN affiliate KABC. A protest is planned for Thursday in Cincinnati, reported CNN affiliate WXIX.  Philly.com said a \"Philly is Baltimore\" protest will be held Thursday at Philadelphia City Hall.

And sometimes, airlines lose things that are irreplaceable. American Jennifer Stewart says she was devastated to learn that Etihad Airways lost her most important baggage following a recent trip from Abu Dhabi to New York City: her 2-year-old pet cat, Felix. Stewart said that she and her husband, Joseph Naaman, booked Felix on their Etihad Airways flight from the United Arab Emirates to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on April 1. Shortly after the plane arrived in New York that evening, Felix went missing somewhere on the grounds of Kennedy Airport, according to Etihad Airways. Felix was able to get loose, Stewart said she believes, because the cat's plastic carrier was badly damaged at some point either during the flight or the transfer from the airplane to the pickup area. Stewart said a cargo manager called the couple to an office after they landed at Kennedy last week and notified them that their cat's carrier had been crushed. Photographs taken by Stewart showed a large hole in the top of the cat's carrier. At least one of the corners of the case appeared partially collapsed. Nearly one week later, Felix remains missing. \"For them to take a cat and ship him like he was cargo, not a live animal, makes me sick,\" Stewart said.  \"You trust that people care and are doing the job well, and then this happens.\" A representative for Etihad Airways told CNN that that the loss of pets during air travel is \"extremely rare.\"  The airline shipped more than 200 pets last year. Etihad Airways is investigating the incident and is working with ground handlers at the New York airport to help locate the missing cat. The Abu Dhabi-based carrier also said it hired \"third-party specialists\" to help in the hunt for Felix. \"We deeply regret this unfortunate incident and are keeping the owner apprised of the progress of the search,\" Etihad Airways told CNN in a statement. \"We will review our pet handling procedures in the wake of this incident, as the safety and care of pets traveling with Etihad Airways is a top priority.\" Stewart and her husband booked the cat's flight as part of their job relocation to the United States after living in Abu Dhabi for more than three years. The couple said they spent $1,200 to ship Felix on the 14-hour flight. \"You pay all of this money, but for what? People assume you pay extra to have your pets taken care of, but they're treated no differently than a free piece of checked luggage,\" Stewart said. It isn't the first time a pet has gone missing at New York's busiest airport. In August 2011, a cat escaped from its carrier before an American Airlines flight from New York to San Francisco. That cat was eventually discovered -- alive -- two months later in a customs room at the airport. But the cat later had to be euthanized because of injuries and malnutrition it suffered while lost. This weekend, Stewart enlisted the help of a local nonprofit, which provided a highly trained detection dog, to help track down Felix's scent. A wildlife biologist who works with the airport has also placed traps to facilitate Felix's safe return, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Officials at Kennedy have offered to assist Etihad Airways as the airline investigates what happened, the Port Authority said. Stewart said the couple will continue to search the airport until they have answers. \"We just want to find Felix. But I just don't know if we will,\" she said.\n"]}

Brown has not played since the final round of the RBS 6 Nations on March 21, is still suffering headaches after a week-long holiday in Dubai and no closer to being declared symptom-free. The episode raises questions about whether the 29-year-old was brought back too early for England\u2019s title-decider against France, having been knocked out in the Test against Italy five weeks earlier following a crunching collision with Andrea Masi. Mike Brown is knocked out in a collision with Italy\u2019s Andrea Masi in the Six Nations last month . Brown was out cold for approximately eight minutes and hasn't played since the Italy game on March 21st . \u2018It\u2019s a concern because I don\u2019t like someone coming in with something you can\u2019t diagnose,\u2019 said O\u2019Shea, Quins\u2019 director of rugby. \u2018Sometimes a physio will sit you down and say, \u201cIt\u2019s six to 12 weeks out\u201d. Here it could be tomorrow or it could be whenever \u2014 we don\u2019t have a timescale. There\u2019s no doubt that a decade or even a year ago Browny would be back out on the pitch. \u2018You want to see the gladiatorial side of things \u2014 the big hits that we\u2019ve all grown up with. It was once a badge of honour that you got up and got on with it. But at least we\u2019re now aware. Is it a concern for the game that we\u2019re seeing collisions of the nature that we are? Yes, it has to be.\u2019 Brown will have played just six of his club\u2019s last 19 games after sitting out of the coming weekend, and his England team-mates Joe Marler and Chris Robshaw have featured in only eight of the last 18. Northampton have ruled out George North, who is suffering from his own concussion problems after being knocked out in three different collisions, until the end of the month and O\u2019Shea must also deal with the absence of one of his marquee players. George North suffered his third concussion in four months during Northampton's defeat to Wasps . \u2018You can look at a succession of events for George North, whereas this is a follow-on of symptoms from one event,\u2019 said O\u2019Shea. \u2018Against Italy it was as big a hit as I\u2019ve seen someone take. It was quite frankly a monstrous hit. I was pretty worried when I saw it live. \u2018Is it tough on us having the England full back for six out of 19 games and still indeterminate? Yes, but there are more important things than rugby.\u2019\n"]}

Arsene Wenger has revealed the selection process he uses to pick his Arsenal team . Wenger lifts the FA Cup following Arsenal's triumph over Hull City at Wembley last season . 'You try to make it as scientific as much as you can, but it's intuitive as well because you have to think if the balance of the team is right or if one player was a bit better in the last training session. 'When two players are together in your mind, competing for one position, every single detail can go for one of them - experience, confidence under pressure - everything can make a difference. 'I always have a final chat with the medical people to make my mind up and make sure that everybody is alright. I do that on the morning of every game. Then I make my decision.' But even though the Frenchman waits until the hours before the game to confirm his team, the overall selection process takes much longer. Wenger, drenched in champagne, is held aloft by his players after Arsenal's FA Cup win last season . Wenger said: 'Anyway, you always have your team in your head, for the whole week. You never go to bed without thinking about what the next line-up will be. 'You live with that always. That can create uncertainties, because you think about it every day.

The Pacman laughed with trainer Freddie Roach on Monday after Shapiro, most famed for representing OJ Simpson in 1995, gave him a custom-made speed ball with Mayweather's face painted on it. Pacquiao's speed and work rate are expected to be his biggest weapon against Mayweather when they take the ring in less than three weeks at the MGM Grand Garden Area in Las Vegas. Manny Pacquiao inspects a speed ball with the face of Floyd Mayweather painted on it during a break from training on Tuesday . Pacquiao and his trainer Freddie Roach (right) laugh at the gift given by celebrity lawyer Robert Shapiro (centre in the white hat) Robert Leslie Shapiro, 72, is a civil litigator working out of Los Angeles-based firm Glaser Weil Fink Jacobs Howard Avchen & Shapiro. Most famously, Shapiro was an integral member of OJ Simpson's 1995 defense team when the former NFL player successfully fought charges that he murdered his ex-wife Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman in 1994. Other star clients include baseballers Darryl Strawberry, Jos\u00e9 Canseco and Vince Coleman, along with Johnny Carson, the Kardashians, Ol' Dirty Bastard and Linda Lovelace. In the US, he also appears in TV commercials for LegalZoom, a company he co-founded. Pacquiao is the underdog for the bout, billed as The Biggest Fight In History and tipped to gross more than \u00a3300m, but you wouldn't know it from his quiet  confidence as he works through the closing stages of preparations with Roach at his Los Angeles base. While sparring has been strictly off limits to all but their inner sanctum, Pacman looked fresh and sharp as he limbered up and shadow boxed during his session on Tuesday at the Wild Card Boxing gym, just off Santa Monica Boulevarde in Hollywood. For victory the eight-division world champion must do what no-one has done in Mayweather's 47-fight career and inflict defeat on the Money Man from Michigan, a five-division world champion in his own right and, of course, the holder of the welterweight titles they'll be fighting for.

There have been no shortage of reports out of both camps that the other's preparations are below par. Pacquiao's promoter Bob Arum claimed Maywether's sparring has been limited by a split lip, which was later confirmed in an eye witness report from David Mayo from MLive.com, in addition to some cuts on his knuckles. 'Let me confirm that Mayweather indeed has been coping with hand injuries. He has some skin marks on his knuckles. They require antiseptic. He even sometimes blows on them to relieve the stinging after the medication is applied, lest anyone think it is impossible to hurt boxing's pound-for-pound king,' Mayo wrote. They aren't injuries to be worried about though, says Mayo, just like the reported calf problems Pacquiao is said to have been struggling with. 'Mayweather is 38. Pacquiao is 36. It would be a surprise if they didn't have some aches and pains. And it would be an excuse if anyone said a split lip or cramping calves in early April had any effect on a fight scheduled in early May,' he added. It's thirsty work for Pacquiao with less than three weeks to wait before he takes the ring against Mayweather . Pacman takes a rest against the ropes during his tough workout with Roach and his close-knit entourage . Last week Pacquiao's own sparring was cut short after US Anti Doping Agency technicians arrived to take four vials of blood for routine testing ahead of the fight.\u00a0Roach decided to call it a day for his fighter, who had only been running the day before. Boxing Scene reported Arum saying that Pacquiao didn't want to keep the USADA officials waiting so gae blood and urine before his workout.\u00a0'Since it took a while to get it done, Freddie (Roach) asked Manny to take off,' Arum reportedly said. Arum then said Mayweather was 'getting hit a lot by his sparring partners and couldn't spar for a few days because his lip was cut and they had to manufacture a special headgear that also covered his lips because every time Floyd got hit, it bled.' Mayweather doesn't appear too bothered though, Tweeting on Friday: 'I always have the remedy to do what I have to do to come out on top.'\n"]}

But second children are left to rely on hand-me-downs, with around \u00a3500 less spent on them in their first year of life. More than a third of mothers clothed their second baby in one or more hand-me-downs, with 46 per cent giving them toys bought for their elder sibling. Second children are left with hand-me-downs, and around \u00a3500 less spent on them in their first year of life . And though 82 per cent have a memento of their first child, such as a lock of hair or a video of their first steps, only 23 per cent have a keepsake for their second, a report by Debenhams found. The new Royal baby may be about to force Prince George to share the Royal spotlight, but most second borns in the family have every reason to feel hard done by, the research shows. Doubtless the latest addition to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's family, due next week, won't have to put up with many hand-me-downs, but he, or she, will be a baby that bucks the trend, says the new study. The report for the high street retailer found on average the second born has over \u00a3500 less spent on them in the first 12 months, than the first sibling who is showered with attention and given the best of everything. Second children have to put up with having fewer new clothes bought for then as well as having a poorer record of their upbringing, with noticeably fewer photos and home movies taken of their young life. It happened with Prince William and Prince Harry as babies. The Duke of Cambridge has 124m images and mentions on social media of him as a toddler compared with 116m for the younger brother. Prince Willam and Prince Harry:\u00a0The Duke of Cambridge has 124m images and mentions on social media of him as a toddler compared with 116m for the younger brother . Over eight out of ten mums (82%) say they have a memento of their first child, such as a lock of hair, a video of the first step, or the first drawing while less than one in four (23%) have a keepsake of their second. A third (32%) of second time mums admit to clothing their new baby in one or more hand-me-downs and almost half (46%) say they give them toys which had been brought originally for the elder brother or sister. Mums confess to wasting money on the first born due to, 'inexperience', and the, 'excitement' of a first baby, but also report a sharp decline in gifts for the second- born. They also say they are more knowledgeable about toddlers' demands when it comes to subsequent children and realise they don't need so much. The new Royal baby may be about to force Prince George to share the Royal spotlight, but most second borns in the family have every reason to feel hard done by, the research shows . Four of five mums say they bought, or were given, more expensive items than were required when their first child came along. Designer outfits promoted by fashion loving celebrities were rated as the biggest luxury with only 12% of second children being bought clothing with a designer label compared with 38% of first-borns. More than half of first-time mums also admitted to splashing out on clothes their children have never worn. First children have on average 14 cuddly toys by the age of six months, whereas the later child makes do with an average of eight. Mums said they asked friends and relatives for specific practical gifts for the second child rather than relying on chance, which cut down on presents that were never used. When asked about family albums of their children up to the age of two, three quarters admit that those photos almost always include the older sibling. It was only when a toddler started nursery school that the second child started having more photos taken. Debenhams head of childrenswear, Shani Delargy said: 'Having a baby at any time is a momentous experience but it's understandable that mums adopt a much more practical approach by the time the second child comes along. 'Whilst mothers want the best for all their children. It's all about being sensible and looking for good value products. At Debenhams we recognise this and offer a great choice of baby products and clothing for all budgets, including designer labels at high street prices.' According to the Office for National Statistics the average age to have a second child is 30.1 years, while the average age of first time mothers is 28.1 years old. The Duchess of Cambridge was 31 when Prince George was born and is now aged 33.

{"question_id": 90, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)In the end, it played out like a movie. A tense, heartbreaking story, and then a surprise twist at the end. As eight of Mary Jane Veloso's fellow death row inmates -- mostly foreigners, like her -- were put to death by firing squad early Wednesday in a wooded grove on the Indonesian island of Nusa Kambangan, the Filipina maid and mother of two was spared, at least for now. Her family was returning from what they thought was their final visit to the prison on so-called \"execution island\" when a Philippine TV crew flagged their bus down to tell them of the decision to postpone her execution. Her ecstatic mother, Celia Veloso, told CNN: \"We are so happy, so happy. I thought I had lost my daughter already but God is so good. Thank you to everyone who helped us.\" Supporters were \"overjoyed\" with the news. \"This is all because of the efforts of the Filipino people and the international community who have been with Mary Jane, her family and the Filipino people all throughout,\" a supporter said upon hearing of the eleventh-hour reprieve. Veloso was arrested in 2010 after a flight from Malaysia to Indonesia when $500,000 worth of heroin was discovered in the lining of her luggage. Supporters, including the Filipino advocacy group Migrante, and her lawyers claim the young mother was the victim of human trafficking. They say she was offered work in Malaysia, but when she arrived she was told the job had been filled and wasn't aware the bag she'd been given for the return journey to Indonesia was filled with drugs. The Philippine Embassy in Indonesia's capital, Jakarta, said Wednesday that it welcomed the reprieve and appreciated that the Indonesian government appeared to be reconsidering the case. \"While Mary Jane was convicted for a drug-related offense in 2010, the Philippines believes that due to her personal circumstances, she herself is a victim of heartless drug syndicates,\" embassy political secretary Jed Llona said. \"The alleged recruiters of Mary Jane are currently being investigated in the Philippines, and the embassy hopes that through this ongoing case, those truly responsible for drug trafficking in the region are brought to justice.\" Questions about her detention and trial, including the competency of her translator, have also been raised. Veloso had been given the customary 72 hours' notice of execution, and her family had traveled to Nusa Kambangan to say their final goodbyes. However, developments in her home country appear to have changed  -- or at least delayed -- her fate. CNN Philippines reported that Veloso's alleged recruiter, Maria Kristina Sergio, and her partner Julius Lacanilao surrendered to authorities in the Philippines Tuesday. Sergio faces charges of illegal recruitment, human trafficking, and fraud, but maintains her innocence. Sergio said that she had received anonymous death threats by phone, and further threatening messages from Veloso's family on social media. Veloso's lawyer, Edre Olalia, confirmed that developments in the case had prompted the stay. \"As far as Mary Jane is concerned, her life has been spared for the moment and the reason is that the legal proceedings in the Philippines must be respected first in view of the fact that the illegal recruiter is now in custody,\" he told CNN Philippines. Indonesian President Joko Widodo told reporters Wednesday that the decision was the result of the Indonesian government's desire to cooperate with the ongoing case in the Philippines. \"There was a letter from the Philippine government saying that there is a legal process related to human trafficking there. So we need to respect this legal process.\" He stressed, however, that the execution was delayed, rather than canceled. Veloso's case has touched the public in her native Philippines, with the highest levels of government and celebrity calling for mercy. President Benigno Aquino met his Indonesian counterpart on the sidelines at the ASEAN summit in Kuala Lumpur last weekend and pressed for him to commute Veloso's sentence. Filipino boxing superstar Manny Pacquiao, who is primed to fight longtime foe Floyd Mayweather Saturday, made a televised appeal to President Widodo, also asking for mercy for Veloso. \"I am begging and knocking on your kind heart that Your Excellency will grant executive clemency to her,\" he said. Veloso's sons, Mark Daniel and Mark Darren, ages 6 and 12, issued a heartbreaking plea, aimed at Widodo's son, asking him to intervene. \"Please tell your father not to execute her,\" they asked. Ordinary people are also fighting for their compatriot, including Filipino domestic workers in Hong Kong, who protested at the Indonesian Consulate in Hong Kong Tuesday. Philippine Embassy officials said Veloso would be returned to Yogyakarta prison in Central Java later on Wednesday. Lawyers fighting to delay her execution previously said they'd given up their bid after her second legal review was rejected on Monday.\n"]}

On Thursday morning, the NSW State Emergency Service said about 2000 people in the Hunter Region - including the Macdonald Valley, Webbs Creek Valley and Colo Valley - are expected to be isolated for days. The murky flood water submerges the train line and begins moving like a river as it reaches almost the height of the platform . The flooding at Bardwell Park forced the partial closure of the T2 Airport line in Sydney . An evacuation order remains in place for parts of Milperra in Sydney, about 200,000 remain without power and the SES is still working to address 50 per cent of 12,420 calls for help it has received since Monday morning. In Dungog, in the Hunter Region, an elderly woman and two elderly men reportedly died in their homes as water surged through the small town after it received more than 300mm of rain in 24 hours. The Bureau of Meteorology said wild weather conditions would continue to ease on Thursday but warned floodwaters still had yet to peak in some areas - including Singleton and Bulga in the Hunter. NSW SES deputy commissioner Steven Pearce said: 'The recovery effort will be huge for those areas that have been smashed by what has been the largest storms in the last 10 years.' After being submerged in flood water, the airport line reopened in time for the afternoon peak . The train line appeared more like a river than a track on Wednesday .

Most of those sentenced -- 52 of the 73 defendants -- were tried in absentia, with 21 already in prison, according to Egynews. Some blamed the church and other attacks on supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist movement that backed Mohamed Morsy. Morsy became Egypt's first democratically elected president following the ouster of longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Morsy was pushed out by Egypt's military.

Sensors at Argentina's Esperanza Base on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula recorded a temperature of 17.5\u00b0C (63.5\u00b0F). According to meteorologists this is potentially a new record for the warmest temperature measured on the frozen continent. The new temperature record was measured on the northern tip of the Antarctic Peninsula (pictured) where the ice shelf covering the sea has declined considerably in recent years and glaciers are thought to be receding . Over a two day period last week temperatures reached 17.4\u00b0C (63.3\u00b0F) and 17.5\u00b0C (63.5\u00b0F). However, the heatwave on the coldest continent on Earth has still to be officially certified by the World Meteorological Organisation. Antarctica's icy edge is disappearing in warming ocean waters, with the last decade seeing the rate of ice loss increase dramatically. This is according to a new study that has combined 18-years worth of ice shelf thinning data from three different sets of satellites. The researchers claim that some ice shelves in West Antarctica have lost as much as 18 per cent of their volume in the last ten years. Satellite data from 1994 to . 2012 clearly shows the accelerating decline which could hasten the rise in global sea levels, . scientists say. The findings come amid concern among many scientists about the effects of . global climate change on Earth's vast, remote polar regions. The previous hottest temperature recorded in Antarctica - which is usually the coldest place on Earth - was in April 24 1961 when the temperature reached 17.1\u00b0C (62.8\u00b0F). Writing for website Weather Underground, meteorologist Dr Jeff Masters said: 'A new all-time temperature record for an entire continent is a rare event. 'This week's record temperatures were made possible by an unusually extreme jet stream contortion that brought a strong ridge of high pressure over the Antarctic Peninsula, allowing warm air from South America to push southwards over Antarctica. 'At the surface, west to east blowing winds over the Antarctic Peninsula rose up over the 1,000-foot high mountains just to the west of Esperanza Base, then descended and warmed via adiabatic compression (without transfer of heat) into a warm foehn wind (a warm dry wind that blows down a slope).' Antarctica is known as the coldest place on Earth where temperatures have dropped to -93.2\u00b0C (-135.8\u00b0F) on the East Antarctic Plateau. The graphic above shows rates of thickness change around the Antarctic coastline with areas of most loss in the past 18 years indicated by red circles and areas where ice has increased shown by blue circles . However, the Antarctic Peninsula is one of the fastest warming spots on Earth. While most of the continent has experienced an increase in ice sheet mass, nearly 10,000 square miles of ice has been lost from the ice shelves off coast of the Peninsula. Glaciers extending out from the fjords of the Antarctic Peninsula have also been retreating, according to researchers. Climate scientists have blamed the changes happening there on human-generated global warming. The collapse of the Larson B shelf (shown above) on the Antarctic Peninsula is one example of the changes that have been taking place on the continent in recent years and have caused concern among some scientists . Marine sediment cores suggest the changes happening in the area are unprecedented at least in the past 10,000 years. Dr Masters said last week's heatwave matched a trend occurring around the world. He said that in 2015 five nations or territories have now set all time records or matched their records for hottest temperatures in history. He added that 46 nations or territories, out of 235, have set or tied all time heat records since 2010. However, despite the new record temperature, climate scientists are urging caution about drawing conclusions from it. This graphic shows how warm water from the ocean may be increasing the flow of glaciers from the Antarctic ice sheet as they cause melting from below while fresh snow accumulates on top of the ice sheet . Gavin Schmidt, a climate scientist with Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York, told National Geographic that last year Antarctica also logged a record cold temperature. He said that long term climate changes in Antarctica are complex and still have not been complained properly. The new record will also depend on what scientists regard as being Antarctica. Currently the World Meteorological Society records the warmest temperature on the continent as being at Vanda Station on the opposite side Antarctica on 1 May 1974 when temperatures reached\u00a015\u00b0C (59\u00b0F).\n"]}

A teenager bullied and groomed a friend with learning difficulties into helping him make a pipe bomb in a series of coded text messages which were given away when the friend failed to grasp that 'cake' was a codeword for 'bomb', a court has heard. Kazi Islam, 18, sent messages via his Blackberry to Harry Thomas, 19, praising Lee Rigby's killers and encouraging him to buy a knife to attack soldiers with, along with the ingredients to make an explosive device, the Old Bailey was told. Islam, who is accused of preparing for acts of terrorism, used  'cake' as code for bomb in his messages, but failing to understand his ingenious ruse, Thomas replied: 'Cake? U mean the b o m b', the jury was told. The court heard that Islam, from Manor Park, east London, met Mr Thomas at Barking and Dagenham College in October 2013, and immediately began manipulating him. Messages taken from Islam's phone show that Mr Thomas had confided in Islam about a break-up with his girlfriend, and Islam lied to him about suffering a break-up of his own, saying: \u2018Coming back to Islam helped me.\u2019 Prosecutor Annabel Darlow QC said Islam then used his friend to help assemble parts for a pipe bomb, including fireworks, hydrogen peroxide, pipes, metal end caps and glue. She said: \u2018The defendant carefully groomed Mr Thomas over many months, flattering him when he appeared willing to do his bidding and bullying him with implied threats of what people associated with him would do if he didn\u2019t carry out his wishes when he didn\u2019t appear to be going according to plan. \u2018During the same time period, Kazi Islam carried out research on the internet for information which could assist him in the construction of an explosive device. \u2018He also applied liberal encouragement to Thomas to murder a British soldier, inciting him with stories about the murder of innocent children by the military forces and referring approvingly to the murder of Fusilier Lee Rigby in Woolwich.\u2019 Ms Darlow said Islam\u2019s messages on WhatsApp and BlackBerry messenger show he was trying to radicalise others at the same time. She added: \u2018His activities centred upon two particular planned acts of terrorism. The first of those was a plot to construct an improvised explosive device. The pair met while at Barking and Dagenham College (pictured) in October 2013 after Mr Thomas confided in Islam about breaking up with his girlfriend. Islam then began bullying and grooming Mr Thomas . \u2018He also entered into discussions about a second scheme of his, that was to murder a member of the armed forces, although the evidence would seem to show us that the first plot had reached a far more advanced stage than the second. \u2018In respect of both enterprises, he sought to use a vulnerable and impressionable young man with mental health difficulties.\u2019 Shortly after the pair met in October 2013, they began talking about buying 'ingredients' for their bomb, with Mr Thomas telling Islam where to find steel and brass caps, the Old Bailey heard. In messages on November 1, Islam admonishes his friend for buying ten inch pipes instead of five inch ones, the jury was told. In a text message Islam then adds: \u2018What you need to do is get me the fireworks mate. Ones dat have flash powder in them. The explosions gonna make a big noise.\u2019 Four days later Islam sends Mr Thomas a picture, and Mr Thomas replies asking: 'Is that what we're going to make?' While the image was not shown in court, Ms Darlow said it could be inferred from the response. She added: \u2018As the messages between Mr Thomas and the defendant expose all too clearly, Mr Thomas was a vulnerable, not particularly bright young man who was desperate to impress Islam and to try and forge some sort of friendship with him. The court heard that Islam tried to use 'cake' as a codeword for the bomb, but not understanding Mr Thomas replied, saying: 'Cake? U mean the b o m b' \u2018Islam exploited to the utmost his friend\u2019s vulnerability and obvious wish to try and ingratiate himself with Islam.\u2019 In December 2013 it appears that Mr Thomas began having second thoughts about the plot, so Islam told him that British soldiers had murdered an innocent 10-year-old boy, the court heard. Mr Thomas then asked Islam if a report in a newspaper saying one of Lee Rigby\u2019s killers had raped a teenager was true, the jury was told. Islam responded: \u2018If you read it in the newspaper it\u2019s lies, the media will do anything to give Muslims a bad name.\u2019 Islam also suggested that Mr Thomas change his first name from Harry to Haroon, saying it sounded better. Later that month Islam began messaging Mr Thomas about killing a soldier with a knife, Ms Darlow told the Old Bailey. In messages shown to the court,\u00a0Islam wrote: \u2018David Cameron is sending troops to kill innocent people, his soldiers are committing mass murder. \u2018If the war doesn\u2019t stop, there should be another soldier killed.\u2019 Thomas replied: \u2018U want me to get one\u2019 and Islam told him \u2018yeah\u2019. Islam then asked if Mr Thomas would carry out an attack on a soldier. He replied: \u2018I don\u2019t agree with what Cameron is doing. I would kill a soldier because they are scum. They have no right to kill these children.\u2019 Pleased with the reply, Islam told him: \u2018Well done Harry. I\u2019m glad you understand mate.. I\u2019m proud of you.\u2019 Around the same time Islam began asking Mr Thomas to buy hydrogen peroxide from a shop in order to make into explosives, the court was told. In February the following year Islam also downloaded issues of Al Qaeda's magazine Inspire to his laptop, along with a guide on how to make semtex, Ms Darlow said. However, messages revealed that around this time Islam discovered that Mr Thomas had been telling other people about the bomb, and began threatening him, it was said. He wrote: 'The brothers are gonna come after me and kill me and they\u2019re gonna kill u as well.' Police raided Islam's home in August and recovered a Lenovo laptop computer where they found the bomb-making guides, along with evidence of searches for extreme preachers and extremist material. Islam also sent Mr Thomas texts praising Michael Adebolajo (left) and Michael Adebowale (right), Lee Rigby's killers, and asked his friend to get a meat clever to kill a soldier, the Old Bailey heard . The court heard Islam\u2019s phone had been used to look up the Al Qaeda propaganda magazine Inspire and the article \u201844 ways to support Jihad\u2019. Islam had also looked up the name of hate preacher Anjem Choudary, killer Michael Adebolajo, and former Guantanamo Bay detainee Moazzam Begg, police said. Ms Darlow said that when Islam was arrested, police also raided Mr Thomas\u2019 home. She added: \u2018Nothing was found to suggest Harry Thomas had in fact gone on to purchase any of the items the defendant had asked him to purchase.\u2019 Islam denies engaging in conduct in preparation of terrorist acts, contrary to section 5 (1) of the Terrorism Act 2006.

Australian artist Ben Quilty has penned an impassioned message to the Indonesian President in the final hours before his treasured friends, Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan, are expected to be executed in Indonesia . Artist and vigil organiser, Ben Quilty speaks during the Ampuni (Mercy) Vigils in February. He has long led the Mercy campaigns and has now addressed a message to Indonesian President Joko Widodo . The heartbreaking message Ben Quilty wrote, directed at Joko Widodo, during Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran's last day on earth . Present Joko Widodo has repeatedly rejected all pleas for clemency for the nine on death row . 'Joko Widodo tonight you will kill two good men, my friends,' Quilty wrote. 'I want you to know that you may take their freedom and their lives, you may rob their fellow inmates of the support and love that both men have offered and provided for so long, you can turn off Myu's imagination but you will never kill the memory of them.' Quilty has pledged to become the 'most outspoken critic of the death penalty for the rest of my life'. 'I have promised Myu and Andrew, their parents and their siblings, that I will fight against the death penalty for the rest of my life,' he wrote. Quilty gives an insight into the two men's compassionate characters and the strength he imagines they are showing during their last hours of earth. 'I can also assure you that Myu and Andrew will care for the other inmates you will execute tonight,' he wrote. A portrait on Ben Quilty, painted by his protege and death row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran . Recent paintings done in prison by Australian drug convict and death row prisoner Myuran Sukumaran are carried by relatives at the Nusakambangan port in Cilacap across from the Nusakambangan maximum security prison island on his last day alive. The heart is his last ever painting . 'The six men and one young woman from the Philippines, Ghana, Brazil and Nigeria will have two constant, calming and compassionate voices beside them right until the last second.' The artist particularly mentions that Sukumaran would be a vital source of comfort for single mother-of-two, Filipino woman Mary Jane Veloso, who was not allowed a translator during her crucial court cases. 'Myuran will continue to translate your executioner's words into English for Mary Jane Veloso and Andrew will calm and console,' Quilty wrote, describing the artist and the priest. 'I know that before the sound of your guns the island will hear the comforting whisper of Myuran Sukumaran and Andrew Chan.' Quilty has tirelessly led the Mercy Campaigns and organised vigils to appeal for mercy from the Indonesian Government. He has organised concerts and created videos with well-known Australians pleading for compassion to be shown for the two young men.

Helen Chan, the mother of Andrew Chan cries as she arrived from Nusakambangan island at a hotel in Cilicap, Central Java, Indonesia . Quilty has previously described Sukumaran as 'humble and generous and kind'. 'He is not a terrorist. He is not even dangerous,' wrote Quilty in March, as Sukumaran and Chan were taken by Special Force soldiers. 'He was a self indulgent kid. But now he is a quiet, dignified young man. He is an artist.' On Monday, as time continued to slip away, Quilty posted another reflection as he tried to come to terms with the imminent death of his Sukumaran, a masterful artist who became his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Sukumaran completed a fine arts degree this year through correspondence with Curtin University and produced his last artwork on Tuesday afternoon \u2013 a heart, signed by all nine people on death row. 'With his passing my world will take a dark plunge backwards,' Quilty wrote.

Supporters of Bali Nine duo Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran held a vigil tonight as the pair prepare to face the firing squad this evening at Indonesia's Nusakambangan Island . He's called for the men to be pardoned and organised candle-lit vigils in a bid to sway Indonesian President Joko Widodo's favour. But with the news on Monday that Indonesia authorities have told the men they had begun the 72-hour notification period, even Quilty's hope appears to be fading. 'Myu is ok. He is ready for what is to come,' he posted on Facebook. The artist said his friend, Sukumaran, had brought people together in an outpouring of compassion. 'We will all ensure that compassion continues to flourish,' he promised. Quilty also hit out at media reports depicting Sukumaran as 'The Enforcer' and hoped in the future no young man would be victimised by such coverage.

An ambulance bearing the name of Mary Jane Veloso, a Filipino facing execution, enters Wijayapura port as it heads to the prison island of Nusa Kambangan in Cilacap, preparing for the executions . 'The only thing Myu enforced in me is that compassion is at the core of a healthy society,' he wrote. Notably, Quilty rose to prominence in the Australian contemporary art scene for his expressive artworks - such as a series of crashed car portraits - that often focused on the destructive character of masculine youth. Now, it appears his one-time pupil and eternal friend will pay the ultimate price for such indiscretions. 'Myu made terrible mistakes,' Quilty writes. 'So did I, but Myu, his family and his friends will pay a dreadful price for his youthful self-indulgence. 'And so will Myu.' It comes as Sukumaran and Chan's heartbroken families pleaded for the Indonesian government to spare their brother's lives after their final goodbyes on Tuesday afternoon.

But 10 years on from the sunny April day that saw Camilla Parker-Bowles become the Duchess of Cornwall, things are looking very different for the 67-year-old royal. Indeed, so popular has Camilla become, a recent poll revealed that not only is the Duchess loved by 50 per cent of Britons, 56 per cent credit her with Charles' own increasing popularity. Scroll down for video . Relaxed: The Prince of Wales has cut an increasingly relaxed figure since marrying Camilla . Still in love: An intimate photo released today to mark their 10th wedding anniversary . More to the point, she has also become a much-loved member of the Royal Family, adored by her step-sons William and Harry and noticeably close to her mother-in-law, the Queen. That her relationship with the rest of the Firm is so good is due, in no small part, to her 'charm and charisma', both of which got an appreciative mention from her husband during a recent interview with CNN. The natural warmth she displays during public appearances has helped cement her place in the Royal Family, with courtiers impressed by her knack of creating an instant rapport with members of the public. Most recently, she pulled off a tour of the US with aplomb, charming locals with her approachability and winning admiring headlines at home. Her relaxed approach to life was in evidence once again during last month's Cheltenham Festival where, accosted by ex-glamour model Katie Price in the paddock, she posed obligingly for a selfie. A few minutes later, she was seen engrossed in conversation with author Jilly Cooper, who memorably based the caddish Rupert Campbell-Black, the star of the much-loved Rutshire Chronicles, on Camilla's ex-husband Andrew Parker-Bowles. Sharing a joke: Camilla and Prince William share a joke at the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games . Natural warmth: Camilla's success is due to her charm - on display here during last month's Cheltenham . Involved: Camilla's granddaughter Eliza Lopes was a bridesmaid at the 2011 Royal Wedding . 'She is warm, smiley and sincere,' reveals one Royal insider. 'If you were going to use five words to describe her, they would be funny, down-to-earth, opinionated, family-orientated and hearty.' But Camilla's new-found confidence is hard-won. A salt-of-the-earth countrywoman who, given the opportunity, would happily go make-up free and avoid set-piece events, taking on the very public life of a senior royal hasn't been easy. That she has managed it, apparently without breaking a sweat, hasn't gone unnoticed - not least by Prince Charles himself. 'You can imagine it is a real, real challenge,\u2019 said the prince in the same CNN interview, adding: 'But she's, I think, been brilliant in the way she's tackled these things\u00a0. insiders say the transformation is less about careful PR work and more about Camilla herself - in particular, the way she has thrown herself into championing the charities closest to her heart. One of the first to benefit was the National Osteoporosis Society, with whom the Duchess has been involved for more than 19 years. 'Throughout our association with the Duchess, she has been unwavering in her support,' says Chief Executive Claire Severgnini. 'She is personable, knowledgeable and compassionate.'

All together: The Duchess of Cornwall in the family photo released after Prince George's christening . Close: The Duchess of Cornwall now enjoys a close relationship with the Queen . Approval: A clear sign of approval is the regularity with which the Duchess appears alongside the Queen . Shared interests: Both Camilla and the Queen share a passion for all things equestrian . Her interest in osteoporosis comes as no surprise to those who know the Duchess. In 1994, aged 47, she was forced to watch as her 'beloved Mama' Rosalind Shand died, slowly and in agony, as a result of the disease. Indeed, the Camilla's association with the charity pre-dates her marriage, with the Duchess first getting involved while still Mrs Parker-Bowles. Asked to join forces with the charity while at the height of her infamy, biographer Penny Junor writes that she was initially reluctant, fearing she might do more harm than good, before agreeing to get involved. Although her first attempt at fundraising was curtailed by Princess Diana's tragic death, she never stopped supporting the organisation and still gets involved in events. She has also made a name for herself as a champion of women's rights, becoming deeply involved in the UK's rape crisis centres and making a visit to a local women's refuge part of every international tour. While visiting Colombian capital Bogota last November, she cut a sympathetic figure as she chatted to rape victims over a cup of tea at the Memory, Peace and Reconciliation Center. Having a laugh: Camilla, Harry and Kate share a joke on the balcony of Buckingham Palace in June 2013 . Friendly: The Duchess of Cornwall enjoys a friendly relationship with the Duchess of Cambridge . All smiles: The pair were frequently spotted together during the London 2012 Olympic Games . In Washington last month, the Duchess left Prince Charles to his own devices for a couple of hours while she met detectives working for the District of Colombia's Sexual Assault Response Team. Camilla's increasing confidence has also shown itself in the ensembles she wears, with the frumpy get-ups of old swapped for elegant tailored dresses designed to flatter her still-trim waist. Like the Duchess of Cambridge, she's never far from a delicate cream dress and accessorises nearly everything she wears with one of her trademark five-strand pearl chokers. In the country, she likes tailored tweed suits by Roy Allen, one of her favourite couturiers, cosy coats by Swiss label Moncler and flattering hats by London-based milliner, Lock & Co. But as the Duchess of Cornwall prepares to celebrate her 10th wedding anniversary, it is the sea-change in her family life as much as her public image that ought to leave her smiling. Mirror image: The two also share a similar sense of style - including a penchant for nude pumps . Cheers! Meanwhile Camilla's relationship with Prince Charles has gone from strength to strength . Charm: The Prince spoke glowingly of his wife's 'charm and charisma' in an interview last month . Not only is she close to the Queen, who was once reported as wishing she 'would just go away', Camilla is also adored by Diana's sons William and Harry - as photos of the trio laughing together at the opening ceremony of September's Invictus Games made only too clear. 'Having initially loathed her, the Queen gets on well with Camilla now,' adds the insider. 'She isn't as close to the Queen as Sophie [Countess of Wessex] is but that is partly because the Queen's relationship with Charles is a bit complicated anyway.' What certainly isn't complicated is Camilla's relationship with Charles. Despite such quirks  as maintaining separate country homes, after 10 years, the royal couple are closer - and happier - than ever. Born Camilla Rosemary Shand on the 17th July 1947, the Duchess of Cornwall's 67 years have undoubtedly been interesting ones. The daughter of Major Bruce Middleton Hope Shand and his wife Rosalind, the Duchess was born in London but spent much of her childhood in Sussex along with her siblings, Annabel and Mark. According to her biographer Giles Brandreth, her upbringing, although not royal, was certainly a grand one. 'Camilla is often described as having had an \"Enid Blyton sort of Childhood\",' he writes. 'In fact, it was much grander than that. 'The Shands had position and they had help \u2013 help in the house, help in the garden, help with children. 'They were gentry. They opened their garden for the local Conservative Party Association summer f\u00eate. Enough said.' After a stint at a Swiss finishing school, Camilla burst onto the London social scene as a debutante on the 25th March 1965. But it wasn't all fun, with the future Duchess of Cornwall working as a secretary for a succession of London firms to pay for her Belgravia flat, which she shared with Lady Moyra Campbell. In the late 1960s, Camilla met the man who was to become her first husband, cavalry officer Andrew Parker-Bowles, with the couple dating off and on for several years - with Mr Parker-Bowles striking up a relationship with Princess Anne at one point. Camilla, meanwhile, had struck up a relationship with Prince Charles, who was first introduced to her sometime in 1971. When the couple split following an overseas posting for Charles in 1973, Camilla reconciled with Parker-Bowles and the couple announced their engagement and married the same year. Two children followed. Tom in 1974 and Laura in 1978. But it was her continuing relationship with Prince Charles that would come to define her, with the former couple remaining close friends even after both had married other people. In 1992, claims that the two had remained an item throughout both marriages emerged when Diana: Her True Story was published, followed, a year later by the 'Camillagate' scandal. By 1995, both marriages had come to an end and Charles and Camilla were unofficially back together, with the future Duchess often seen attending events with the prince. Royal acceptance soon followed with the Queen making Camilla part of the Golden Jubilee celebrations in 2002. A year later, the Duchess moved into Clarence House and on the 10th February 2005, Charles and Camilla's engagement was announced. The couple married just under two months later in Windsor, with Camilla taking the title of the Duchess of Cornwall.\n"]}

He wants Stoke to better last year\u2019s points tally of 50 and secure consecutive top-half finishes in the top flight for the first time in 40 years, and this result leaves such feats on the cards. Victory was unlikely in a one-sided first half. Southampton, who had wasted chances, eventually took one when Jose Fonte rose at the near post to divert Steven Davis\u2019s corner goalwards but was denied by a goal-hanging Schneiderlin, who got the final touch before it crossed the line. Graziano Pelle should have doubled the lead when played in by a lively Sadio Mane but Stoke goalkeeper Asmir Begovic saved well to leave Koeman ruing his side\u2019s profligacy. \u2018I think we played very well in the first 45 minutes and were by far better team,\u2019 he said. \u2018Maybe we could have been more clinical in the box but in general we played well today, we played at least at our level and it\u2019s important to keep that for rest of the season.\u2019 For all Southampton\u2019s dominance Stoke should have been level when Geoff Cameron flicked on a Marko Arnautovic free-kick only for an unmarked Steven Nzonzi to inexplicably miss from no more than two yards out. Jose Fonte celebrates with team-mate Schneiderlin as Southampton grabbed the lead against Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium . Schneiderlin  celebrates the first goal with his team-mates during the Barclays Premier League match between Stoke City and Southampton . They did go level following the arrival of Adam from the bench, albeit in exceptionally fortunate circumstances. When Nzonzi mis-hit a cross into the sky there were groans. When it landed on the bar and Diouf slammed home the rebound they turned into disbelieving cheers. The first Delilah of the day duly followed, with Adam urged to shoot wherever he picked up the ball. With six minutes remaining he did just that, lashing home following a goalmouth scramble to bring that song out again. \u2018I think he played the initial ball into the box, followed his ball in and thankfully it has dropped to him,\u2019 said an admiring Hughes. \u2018It\u2019s great technique. He knows exactly what he is doing. He has hit it into the ground and that has made it even harder for the keeper to save it.\u2019 Adam\u2019s fellow substitute Peter Crouch could have piled on the agony for Koeman after being teed up by Jonathan Walters but scuffed his shot wide from six yards. More misery for the Saints arrived in injury time when Toby Alderweireld went down clutching a shoulder and was carried off on a stretcher, although he is expected to be fit for the remainder of the run-in. Regardless, Koeman was certainly laughing no more. Southampton striker Graziano Pelle had his chances but he failed to take them as Southampton lost to Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium .

Depressed Donna Oettinger, 41, had sought urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son Zaki died on train tracks in south London in March 2013, Croydon Coroner's Court heard. She had attempted to kill herself three months before the tragedy but was unable to receive the treatment recommended to her by doctors. Depressed Donna Oettinger, 41, had sought urgent psychiatric help in the months before she and her son Zaki died on train tracks in south London in March 2013, Croydon Coroner's Court heard. \u00a0Ms Oettinger had starting suffering depression after going to Zaki's father, Mohammed El Shaer, in Egypt, and discovering he had another family, an inquest heard . Her mental health had declined after discovering Zaki's father, an Egyptian national who could not travel to the UK, had a second family. She also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened, the inquest heard. After visiting a psychiatrist in November Zaki was referred to social services, although the case was not reviewed. It meant the family and Zaki's safety was never assessed by the authority. A coroner has today ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after Ms Oettinger, made five 'significant' failures in the months before she and her young son lay in the path of a train in March 2012. But at the end of a three day inquest into their deaths, coroner Selena Lynch\u00a0said that despite the family slipping under social services' radar 'nothing could have be done' to foresee the deaths. A coroner has ruled that doctors and social services in charge of looking after Ms Oettinger, made five 'significant' failures. But at the end of a three day inquest into their deaths, coroner Selena Lynch said that despite the family slipping under social services' radar 'nothing could have be done' to foresee the deaths . Ms Lynch concluded at the end of a three-day inquest that Ms Oettinger, who suffered chronic anxiety, unlawfully killed her son. She said: 'Donna Oettinger suffered from depression and had suicidal ideas. 'She had taken a significant overdose and had been seen by a number of professionals. 'The failures that I have identified, are in some respects quite significant, but can't be said to have caused or contributed to her death or Zaki's.' She said some of the measures now in place might have made a difference, but added: 'I think it is unlikely that Donna Oettinger would have been admitted to hospital or prevented from being alone with her child. 'Whether there might have been some improvement in her condition it is impossible to say.' The Coroner identified five separate failures by doctors and nurses at the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Croydon child protection services, who first came into contact with Ms Oettinger in late 2012. Her mental health had declined after discovering Zaki's father, an Egyptian national who could not travel to the UK, had a second family. She also was using cocaine regularly for six months and became convinced she had caused lasting damage and her anxiety worsened, the inquest heard . Ms Oettinger took an overdose of tablets while visiting a friend in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, on December 13 2012. A social worker in Rotherham advised doctors back in Croydon that she should be cared for by a Home Treatment Team (HTT) However the request was not met. After a follow up appointment back in London a few days later no-one liaised with Rotherham and Ms Oettinger was not reassessed. Doctors decided that instead of treating her at home she would benefit from her own 'care coordinator'. But a miscommunication meant this never happened. As a result the Trust failed to check on Ms Oettinger's condition when she missed a number of appointments in early 2013. The pair died around a month after her last missed appointment. Zaki's grandmother, Carol Oettinger, wept as the the Coroner recorded her daughter's death as suicide and the unlawful killing of Zaki. The coroner said: 'With respect to Donna Oettinger the only appropriate conclusion in this case is a matter of law I conclude to be one of suicide.' With respect to Zaki, she said:\u00a0'His mother was suffering from an anxiety disorder. The conclusion for Zaki, again as a matter of law, must be one of unlawful killing.' At the end of the hearing the Coroner pleaded that the horrific nature of Zaki's death and its link to Ms Oettinger's health didn't undo work to end stigma around mental illness. She said: 'It's important to recognise what happened to Donna and Zaki is very much out of the ordinary. '[But] I fear that the stigma of depression and mental illness will grow as a result of events such as these. 'The circumstances of these deaths are extremely upsetting, even for the experienced professionals who dealt with the events of March 22 2013. 'But they represent a tiny fraction of Donna and Zaki's lives. The mother and baby were seen lying on the tracks at a south London station, before their deaths . 'Zaki was a happy child who was very much loved by all those around him and wouldn't have had any time at all to understand what happened to him. 'The events that day do not define them as people. 'Don't let anyone tell you that suicide can always be prevented. They are wrong. Zaki and Donna deserve to be remembered as they were in happier and healthier times.' Speaking after the hearing,\u00a0Bridget Hughes, Solicitor to the Oettinger family at Kingsley Napley LLP said: 'The Oettinger family is devastated by the loss of Donna and dear Zaki. No one could have fought harder than Donna's mother, Carol, to try and get the care her daughter desperately needed when she became ill. 'The Coroner has heard that there were serious shortcomings in care at the Croydon Mood Anxiety and Personality Disorder Team (MAP) which was managed by the South London & Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. 'These shortcomings permeated through from community psychiatric nurse to consultant level. The service, fragmented in design, was chaotic in its implementation. 'In the family's view, this contributed to Donna's deepening despair and distress. 'Nothing will bring Donna and Zaki Oettinger back, but it is hoped that something may be learned from this family's experiences given the detailed investigation that has since taken place.'\n"]}

Staff at Scooter's Coffee, in Omaha, were locked out of the page for almost 24 hours, starting at 5pm on Sunday, by an 'unknown third party' who then took control of the picture feed. Instead of the usual images of smoothies, coffees and cookies, the page was plastered with adult cartoons - similar to those posted on Delta Air Lines and Crayola's pages after they were hacked. Scooter's Coffee, Omaha, issued this apology to customers on its Facebook page after it was hijacked by hackers for 24 hours who used it to post pornography . Scooter's said that the images which appeared on their Facebook page were similar to the images that were posted on Crayola's page when they were hacked in January (pictured) From 5pm Sunday until almost the same time the next day, followers of the Scooter's Facebook page were sent links such as this one, instead of the regular images of smoothies and cookies . After trying to contact officials at Facebook with limited success, it was not until a day later that the company managed to kick the hacker out, and regain control of the account. Jamie Hamburg, spokesman for the company, said: 'At approximately 5pm CST on Sunday, 29 March, the Scooter's Coffee Facebook page was hacked by an unknown third party. 'The offensive content that has been posted as a result of this hack is similar to that seen in other recent breaches of major brands. 'Scooter's Coffee would like to apologize to our loyal Facebook audience and anyone that has been affected by this inappropriate content.' The hack is believed to have come after an employee clicked on a link of a direct message sent through Facebook itself. The hacker then kicked the member of staff out of the page, locked it, and began posting. Scooter's Coffee said that, despite repeated attempts to contact Facbook, and hundreds of reports being sent about inappropriate content, nobody at the social media network responded. It was only by contacting larger businesses that they were able to get in touch with Facebook, who removed the content and restored the page nearly 24 hours later. All of the images have now been removed, and Scooter's have offered apologies to thier customers via their Facebook and Twitter pages . It is thought that the hack occurred after an employee clicked on a link in an email which purported to be from Facebook. Hackers were then able to gather enough data to allow them to take control of the page . Crayon manufacturer Crayola was caught out by a similar breach in January, when hackers took control of the page to post pictures of cartoon breasts, and links to adult websites. One post included a link to a drawing of a scantily clad female cartoon character from the DreamWorks movie 'The Road to El Dorado' - with the words 'If Disney Was For Adults.' Delta Air Lines was also affected the following month in a similar attack\u00a0involving a link to a sexually explicit joke. Their page was hijacked for around an hour, during which 'objectionable and offensive content', similar to that in the Crayola and Scooter's hacks, was published.\n"]}

The image shows a giant distant cluster of about 3,000 stars called Westerlund 2 inside a stellar 'breeding ground' called Gum 29, 20,000 light-years from Earth. In the image massive young stars can be seen feeding a nearby region with the fuel it needs to form new stars. Scroll down for video . A stellar nursery of about 3,000 stars called Westerlund 2 located about 20,000 light-years from the planet earth in the constellation Carina is shown in this image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, released today to celebrate the silver anniversary of Hubble's launch . Hubble was launched on 24 April 1990 aboard Space Shuttle Discovery. Despite a shaky start, when its primary mirror was ground to the wrong shape, Hubble soon began returning fantastic images of the distant universe, to the delight of scientists and the public alike on Earth. And this latest image is no exception, revealing a fascinating cluster of stars in the constellation Carina. The telescope, when it was first devised, was ambitious to say the least - it is 43ft (12.3 metres) long and 14ft (4.2 metres wide). It orbits Earth at a height of about 345 miles (555km) at a speed of 16,000 mph (27,750km/h), with its instruments finely tuned to account for its movement. It is able to image the universe in near-infrared, visible light and ultraviolet. It\u2019s estimated that the telescope can continue operating until 2020, when it will overlap with the James Webb Space Telescope, which is set to launch in 2018. 'Hubble has completely transformed our view of the universe,' said John Grunsfeld, astronaut and associate administrator of Nasa's Science Mission Directorate. 'This vista of starry fireworks and glowing gas is a fitting image for our celebration of 25 years of amazing Hubble science.' Hubble captured the image using its Wide Field Camera 3, which pierced through the dusty veil of dust and gas around the stellar nursery using near-infrared light. The cluster is between six and 13 light-years across but only two million years old, and thus contains some of the hottest, brightest and most massive stars in the galaxy. Some of the biggest stars in the cluster unleash torrents of ultraviolet light and hurricane-force winds of charged particles that disrupt the surrounding cloud of hydrogen gas. Inside the nebula is a fantasy landscape of pillars, ridges and valleys made of gas - the fuel for new stars. Some of the pillars are several light-years tall and point towards the centre of the cluster, while other dense regions surround the pillars. As the clusters is very young in astronomical terms, it has not had time to disperse its stars into deep space, so it provides astronomers an opportunity to gather information on how clusters like this form. Hubble's near-infrared imaging camera pierces through the dusty veil enshrouding the stellar nursery, giving astronomers a clear view of the dense concentration of stars in the central cluster, shown . Westerlund 2 is surrounded by the star-forming region Gum 29. The heaviest cluster stars are unleashing a torrent of ultraviolet radiation and hurricane-force winds streaming with charged particles, etching away the enveloping hydrogen gas cloud from where the cluster formed . The red dots scattered throughout the landscape around Westerlund 2 are a rich population of newly forming stars still wrapped in their gas-and-dust cocoons. These tiny, faint stars are between 1 million and 2 million years old and have not yet ignited the hydrogen in their cores. Hubble's near-infrared vision allows astronomers to identify these fledgling stars . The pillars in the star-forming region surrounding Westerlund 2, composed of dense gas, are a few light-years tall and point to the central cluster. They are thought to be incubators for new stars. Besides sculpting the gaseous terrain, intense radiation from the most brilliant of the cluster stars is creating a successive generation of baby stars. The bluish haze is an indicator of oxygen gas in the nebula . The image is part of a week of celebrations by Nasa to commemorate what is widely regarded as the most important space telescope of all. 'This is really an exciting week for astronomers and people who love astronomy all over the world,' said Hubble scientist Jennifer Wiseman at a televised anniversary celebration at the Newseum in Washington, DC. Learning about the life cycle of stars was one of the reasons Hubble was built. By operating above distortions and blocking effects of Earth's atmosphere, astronomers hoped to look farther back in time, at generations of stars and galaxies that formed closer to the Big Bang, some 13.7 billion years ago. But the mission almost start in disaster, when Nasa discovered a manufacturing flaw in the telescope's 7.9ft (2.4-meter) diameter mirror. Corrective optics, installed by space-walking astronauts, saved the day in 1993, the first of five servicing calls by Space Shuttle crews. 'We never thought it would last this long,' said Nasa administrator and former astronaut Charlie Bolden, the pilot on the mission that launched Hubble. Nasa is celebrating the Hubble Space Telescope's (pictured) 25th anniversary with a variety of events highlighting its groundbreaking achievements and scientific contributions with activities running April 20-26.  In its quarter-century in orbit, the observatory has transformed our understanding of our solar system and beyond, and helped us find our place among the stars . This is one of Hubble's most iconic images: the Eagle Nebula's Pillars of Creation. It shows the pillars as seen in visible light, capturing the multi-coloured glow of gas clouds, wispy tendrils of dark cosmic dust, and the rust-coloured elephants trunks of the nebulas famous pillars. The dust and gas in the pillars is seared by the intense radiation from young stars and eroded by strong winds . Here we see one of the universe's most stately and photogenic galaxies, the Sombrero galaxy, Messier 104 (M104).  The galaxy's hallmark is a brilliant white, bulbous core encircled by the thick dust lanes comprising the spiral structure of the galaxy. As seen from Earth, the galaxy is tilted nearly edge-on . This dramatic image offers a peek inside a cavern of roiling dust and gas where thousands of stars are forming. The image, taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) aboard Hubble, represents the sharpest view ever taken of this region, called the Orion Nebula. More than 3,000 stars of various sizes appear in this image. Some of them have never been seen in visible light . Many of the telescope's most important discoveries turned out to be in areas that didn't even exist when it was launched. Hubble's observations of a particular kind of exploded star helped astronomers realise that the pace of the universe's expansion is ramping up, propelled by some unknown force referred to as 'dark energy.' Hubble also has imaged a planet beyond the solar system and scanned other planets' atmospheres for telltale chemical fingerprints. The first so-called exoplanet was discovered in 1992, two years after Hubble's launch. 'Hubble has fundamentally changed our human understanding of our universe,' Bolden said. Nasa hopes to keep Hubble operating through 2020 to overlap with its successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, due to launch in October 2018.\n"]}

Wardens at Windsor Castle say they are expected to carry out extra duties, including giving guided tours to visitors, for no extra money. Union chiefs claim workers earn as little as \u00a314,700 despite working the \u2018country\u2019s richest family\u2019. Wardens at Windsor Castle (pictured here collecting flowers laid by well-wishers following the death of The Queen Mother) have voted for industrial action in a dispute over pay . Their main role includes meeting and greeting visitors, conducting security searches, telling people about the history of the Castle, and handing out free audio guides. But The Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) said staff are also asked to perform extra duties for free, such as leading paid-for tours, carrying out first aid and speaking foreign languages to overseas visitors. Now, staff have voted \u2018overwhelmingly\u2019 in favour of industrial action after complaining they have suffered \u2018years of pay restraint\u2019. The PCS said 76 wardens out of 180 at the Castle will now refuse to host tours of the Great Kitchen and the Tower and will instead \u2018work to rule \u2013 meaning they rigidly stick to their contractual obligations. The Public and Commercial Services Union said the Queen and Royal Family (pictured at the Castle) should not 'abuse the (workers') goodwill by not properly rewarding them' Wardens are also considering causing \u2018disruption\u2019 and \u2018long queues\u2019 by conducting more thorough security searches than usual and \u2018observing every single check they are supposed to do\u2019 \u2013 slowing down visitors\u2019 entry to the Castle. The wardens work for the Royal Collection Trust, a charity which presides over one of the world\u2019s largest and most important works of art, jewels and artefacts. It is held in trust by the sovereign on behalf of the nation, so they are technically employees of the Royal Household. A spokesman for the PCS said: \u2018The dispute here is not with the Queen and the Royal Family but the managers who run the Castle on their behalf. \u2018The wardens who work at Windsor Castle are very loyal and want to work for the Royal Family. \u2018We believe our requests are modest and reasonable and, by not resolving this dispute, the Royal Collection is dragging the Queen\u2019s name into this. That is not what staff want.\u2019 Staff claim they receive poor salaries and perform extra duties such as guiding visitors around Windsor Castle\u00a0for no additional money . The union has proposed that wardens receive an extra \u00a3150 a year for speaking a foreign language to visitors and an allowance for every day they conduct tours. They claimed that at nearby Hampton Court Palace, owned by a separate charity, wardens received an extra \u00a310 to \u00a315 a day for leading guided tours and that Windsor Castle staff should also receive \u2018fair recompense\u2019. The union said they narrowly accepted a poor pay offer last year on the understanding that additional allowances for tours and other skills would be considered this year. But following failed negotiations, non-strike industrial action could now start from the end of April. A Royal Collection Trust spokesman said: \u2018Following the union ballot, we have been informed that some PCS-affiliated wardens at Windsor Castle will no longer participate in various activities undertaken during their working day, including using their language and first-aid skills, and conducting tours of specific areas of the castle during August and September. A spokesman for the Royal Collection Trust, which employee the wardens at one of the official residences of the Queen said they were 'disappointed' with the result of the ballot . \u2018These activities have never been compulsory. It has always been the choice of the individual as to whether they take part. \u2018While the outcome of the ballot is disappointing, it will have no effect on services to visitors to the castle.\u2019 The Royal Collection said that only nine wardens were required to conduct tours every day out of an average of 85 wardens in work, and that the industrial action should have \u2018no impact\u2019 on visitors. Asked about the threat of slower security searches, a spokeswoman said: \u2018Security searches at Windsor Castle are rigorous and we would expect staff to carry out their usual duties.\u2019 Staff\u2019s wages were raised to the new \u2018living wage\u2019, which is above the National minimum wage, earlier this month. This increased wardens\u2019 pay from \u00a37.70 an hour (\u00a314,400 a year) to \u00a37.85 an hour (\u00a314,700). But the PCS complained that the living wage officially rose last November and that this wage hike should therefore be back-dated \u2013 a condition the Royal Collection has now agreed to.\n"]}

Played with more freedom once Chelsea had the lead and tried to help in attack down the wing. Gary Cahill \u2013 6 .5 . Looked cool when called into action and was able to clear the danger as Stoke tried to cross their way into the lead in the second half. John Terry \u2013 7 . Manned the back well and it took a goal-of-the-season contender for his team to concede against a Stoke side that ran out of ideas at times. Always the man that remained at the back to kill off any threat. Cesar Azpilicueta \u2013 6.5 . Tried to get forward and help Hazard down the left. Closed down well and put in a tireless performance. Nemanja Matic \u2013 6 . A few too many misplaced passes and a hurried clearance almost spelled danger for Chelsea. Cleaned up well when needed to win back possession, however. Cesc Fabregas \u2013 7 . Won the penalty with a clever cut back that fooled Wollscheid. Kept the midfield ticking over well. Brazil international Willian (left) also produced an impressive display for Chelsea in the win over Stoke . Eden Hazard put Chelsea into the lead with from the penalty spot in the first half . Diego Costa's (right) game was curtailed 10 minutes after coming on with what looked like a hamstring injury . Willian \u2013 7.5 . A handful for Stoke as he, Oscar and Hazard linked up well to create chances in the first half, though they were never taken. Never short of a run. Oscar \u2013 6.5 . Scuppered one of Chelsea\u2019s best chances to take the lead by placing his shot wide of the far post, and was ultimately \u2013 and unfortunately \u2013 sacrificed for Costa at half time. Eden Hazard \u2013 8.5 . A live wire. Master of the one-two and creating chances. Ultimately kept his cool from the spot to give Chelsea a much-needed lead before Adam\u2019s equaliser. Didn\u2019t look tired, despite his weariness during international break. Assisted the winning goal. Loic Remy - 7.5 . Looked a worthy replacement for Costa as he twice went close to giving Chelsea the lead in the opening seven minutes. Scored in the second half when Mourinho really needed it, and it was deserved. Loic Remy (left) slots in Chelsea's winner against Stoke in the second half at Stamford Bridge . SUBS: . Diego Costa \u2013 6 . Came on but could do no damage as he was forced off with what looked like another hamstring injury. Immediately called to the bench for him to come off after 10 minutes on the field. Didier Drogba \u2013 6 . Replaced Costa after the striker went off with an injury. Had little to do but hold up the ball. Juan Cuadrado \u2013 6 . Little to do but helped Chelsea get over the line. MANAGER: Jose Mourinho \u2013 6.5 . A frustrating afternoon for Mourinho, who was active on the touchline throughout, looking unhappy and muttering to himself. Either way, it worked, and his team added three points to their title charge. Jose Mourinho was active throughout the game on the touchline as Chelsea beat Stoke 2-1 . STOKE CITY (4-4-2) Asmir Begovic \u2013 6.5 . Outstanding one-handed save at full stretch to deny Remy\u2019s deflected shot after less than three minutes. Ultimately took a penalty for Begovic to concede the first. He\u2019d done his homework, going the same way Hazard normally does, but beaten at the other side. His throw was intercepted by Willian which led to Chelsea's winner, though. Geoff Cameron \u2013 5.5 . Given the unwanted task of stopping Hazard on his runs down the left wing on occasion. Ryan Shawcross \u2013 6 . Stayed physical throughout, as per. Captained his team well on a ground that has been unkind to them previously, but ultimately could not help them steal a point. Philipp Wollscheid \u2013 5.5 . Took the bait from Fabregas by sweeping the Spaniard\u2019s feet to give Chelsea a penalty and ultimately the lead. Ryan Shawcross (right) led Stoke well but could not help his side take a point at Stamford Bridge . Wollscheid (right) slides in on Cesc Fabregas to concede a penalty in the first half, from which Hazard scored . Marc Wilson \u2013 5.5 . A little unsure at times, largely down to a lack of communication between him and his team-mates. Stephen Ireland \u2013 6 . Strong in midfield but found it difficult to get involved as that area was dominated by the men in blue. Glenn Whelan \u2013 5.5 . Rightly booked for a late challenge on Fabregas but did not see much of the ball as Chelsea dominated midfield. Steven Nzonzi \u2013 6 . Close with a controlled shot after a poor clearance by Matic and again in the second half as he grazed the far post with a bouncing effort across goal. Could not take the few chances that fell his way. Steven Nzonzi (centre) went close to scoring for Stoke but ultimately did not impose himself on the game . Charlie Adam (second left) is mobbed by his team-mates after his astonishing strike levelled the scores . Charlie Adam \u2013 6.5 . Take a bow, Charlie Adam. Incredible goal as he channelled his inner David Beckham and, noticing Courtois off his line, scored from in his own half. A little anonymous until that moment, but his faults were obliterated with that 66-yard strike. Jonathan Walters \u2013 5.5 . Little joy as Stoke rarely threatened up top but tried to keep them in with a shot and held the ball well on occasion. Closely marked by Terry throughout. Mame Biram Diouf \u2013 5.5 . Failed to make an impact and was substituted after 62 minutes for Arnautovic. Jonathan Walters (left) had little joy for Stoke against Chelsea on Saturday, despite his hard work .

Paris Saint Germain remain keen on Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech with Liverpool looking unlikely to match the financial package required to prise him out of Stamford Bridge. PSG also like Tottenham's Hugo Lloris but Daniel Levy is no mood to sell the France goalkeeper. Damien Dussaut (left) has impressed for Standard Liege despite only starting five games this season . Manchester City are considering the merits of QPR goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. The 25-year-old has had to take a back seat this season while in-form Robert Green held down the No 1 spot. However, the England U21 international is still recognised as one of the more talented English keepers in the country and has been the subject of interest from Liverpool, Tottenham and Everton over the past year. Alex McCarthy (centre) has played second fiddle to Rob Green at QPR but could be a target for Man City .

The shadow chancellor said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note'. Mr Byrne's glib note to his successor as Treasury Secretary stated: 'Dear Chief Secretary, I'm afraid there is no money. Kind regards \u2013 and good luck! Liam.' Scroll down for video . Damaging: Labour's Liam Byrne sent left this handwritten note to his successor before he left the Treasury in 2010 . The note has become emblematic of Labour's fiscal irresponsibility in office and was used by David Cameron in the seven-way leaders' debate earlier this month. When the Coalition took office in 2010 the budget deficit had reached more than \u00a3150billion \u2013 more than 10 per cent of the entire size of the economy. But Mr Ball insisted the note admitting that Labour had blown the nation's finances should not be taken seriously. He told BBC West Midlands: 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note\u2026 of the course the money hadn't run out.' Mr Balls said Labour would cut the deficit \u2013 still running at \u00a390billion a year \u2013 every year. He said: 'Nothing in our manifesto is going to require additional borrowing. I think in tough times, people want a government which will make tough decisions, and will make the sums add up, and that is what we're saying very clearly today.' But he was asked if Labour was 'credible' and could be trusted with the economy. Mr Balls said: 'I think people want to know the sums add up. People know that the global financial crisis wasn't caused by Labour's spending \u2013 it wasn't Labour's spending on nurses and doctors which meant the Lehman Brothers investment bank went bankrupt in New York. 'Liam Byrne's note was a jokey note, of course the money hadn't run out.' Ed Balls, pictured in Birmingham today, said the letter, left in the Treasury by the former Labour minister Liam Byrne in 2010, was just a 'jokey note' Mr Balls blamed the Lib Dem minister David Laws for leaking the note. He said it was supposed to be a private note, adding: 'It was supposed to be a piece of humour. In fact, in that year, the government spend hundreds of billions of pounds, so of course the money hadn't run out, but there was a large deficit, and we had to get it down, and we needed to get it down in a fair way. 'The reason why we're more credible than the Tories now is that they're not people who understand the need for change in the economy, it's not been all in it together, they've not even balanced the books \u2013 it's going to take a Labour government to do it.' Former Treasury Secretary Liam Byrne left the note to his successor David Laws in 2010 . The Tories this morning slammed Mr Balls's remarks \u2013 claiming they showed that he had not learnt the lessons from the great economic crash. Treasury minister David Gauke said: 'The fact that Ed Balls thinks the debt they left the country was a 'joke' goes to show the contempt they hold the public in. 'It is clear Labour has not learnt the lessons of the past and would do the same all over again - more taxes, more borrowing and more debt.' The letter has haunted Labour for years, allowing Tory and Liberal Democrat ministers to prove the nation's coffers were empty. The letter consisting of just 18 words it offers no apology or justification for the state of the nation's finances, only a glib 'good luck' to whoever was left to clear up the economic mess. Written in blue ink on government note paper, it was opened by Lib Dem David Laws who became Chief Secretary to the Treasury when the coalition was formed. Lib Dem Mr Laws said: 'He left a note which frankly does sum up precisely the state of the Treasury when he left it. I think it is refreshing that a Labour politician has been prepared to admit that.' Mr Byrne has admitted he will regret it for the rest of his life. He said: 'It was a very foolish thing to do. 'I suppose I did think there was a convention amongst honourable members that private correspondence would stay private. 'There's obviously a very old tradition of these notes that goes back to the 1930s. I felt disappointed that some very old conventions had been cast aside for political advantage.'\n"]}

Rosberg asked the team to get Hamilton to speed up, an instruction they issued and one with which the Briton complied. \u2018I wasn\u2019t controlling his race; I was controlling my own race,\u2019 said Hamilton, indignantly. \u2018I had no real threat from Nico.\u2019 But Rosberg said: \u2018It\u2019s interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace. That opened up the opportunity for Sebastian to try that early pit-stop to try and jump me.\u2019 Hamilton countered: \u2018My job is to manage the car and bring the car home as fast as possible and that\u2019s what I did. I didn\u2019t do anything intentionally to slow the cars up.\u2019 Boys, boys. It took a little longer last season for the old karting friends to sling so much mud in public. We are only three races into a 19-round saga and the brickbats and mutual suspicions are already tumbling out. It was easy to sympathise with Rosberg but difficult to agree with him. Even though he was somewhat stronger here than during the opening two race weekends, he must be reaching his wits\u2019 end, frustrated to distraction, wondering how on earth he can possibly beat Hamilton when he is on form. It seems, to this cod psychologist, that it was Rosberg\u2019s deep exasperation that led him to behave as he did. Niki Lauda, the Mercedes chairman, came to his not guilty verdict immediately after the race. \u2018We have first and second,\u2019 said the three-time world champion.

One thing is clear: Lewis had pole and controlled the race from beginning to the end. There\u2019s nothing more to say. True, Lewis will drive selfishly. These guys are egocentric b******s. It is the only way to win the championship, and Nico is the same if the s*** hits the fan. Lewis was better this weekend. \u2018There is no friendship out there. When you race you have to fight, that\u2019s it.\u2019 For Hamilton it was a fourth victory at this extravagant confection of a track, the circuit where he suffered one of the blackest moments of his rookie season, ending up in a gravel trap, his championship hopes devastated in 2007. He again finished the race at a relatively low speed as marshals failed to clear Max Verstappen\u2019s crippled Toro Rosso. The safety car came out. Anti-climax though it was, a giant roar erupted from the 29,000-strong main grandstand as the chequered flag was waved for Hamilton. He was congratulated over the radio for having \u2018the full house\u2019: pole, fastest lap and race win. It was a flawless performance. The race posed many tantalising questions. The first was whether Ferrari could match Mercedes in the temperate Shanghai climate, as they managed in Malaysia a fortnight ago? They were some way off in the end but clearly close enough to spook Rosberg. They will keep Mercedes on their toes, and that is balm for the sport. Hamilton takes great pleasure in spraying champagne over a grid girl as he celebrates his victory at the Shanghai International Circuit . Rosberg appeared glum on the podium after losing out to team-mate Hamilton at the third consecutive race . Hamilton, who has provided emphatic answers to every question asked of him since taking last year\u2019s title, made the perfect start. He inclined his car right on the grid, covering Rosberg next to him, before darting through the first, right-hand corner in front. Contest over before it started. An honourable mention for 17-year-old Verstappen, who drove his Toro Rosso with great elan. He put his car down the inside of Marcus Ericsson\u2019s Sauber, causing Max\u2019s father and former racer Jos to exhale in relief as he watched the dangerous move from the garage. He then applauded in admiration. Alas, Verstappen\u2019s engine gave up on him and he left his machine parked on the start-finish straight. Red Bull\u2019s woes continued with Daniil Kvyat\u2019s Renault engine billowing grey smoke into the Shanghai air. Their other car, driven by Daniel Ricciardo, was ninth. McLaren were even less successful than Red Bull, again. Jenson Button was demoted a place to 14th, having collided with Pastor Maldonado\u2019s Lotus. Button\u2019s team-mate Fernando Alonso was 12th after being lapped by Vettel, his replacement at Ferrari. Vettel was smiling afterwards, but not as widely as Hamilton. Max Verstappen starred once more following a number of thrilling passes, but he failed to make it to the end of the race after his engine expired .

{"question_id": 121, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Boston (CNN)When the bomb went off, Steve Woolfenden thought he was still standing. That was because, as he lay on the ground, he was still holding the handles of his son's stroller. He pulled back the stroller's cover and saw that his son, Leo, 3, was conscious but bleeding from the left side of his head. Woolfenden checked Leo for other injuries and thought, \"Let's get out of here.\" That was before he noticed his Achilles tendon, which resembled transparent tape covered in blood, and his left tibia protruding from his boot. The boot was next to his left stump, he testified before a federal jury Thursday, the third day in which survivors and family members of those killed in the Boston Marathon bombing shared their stories -- often gruesome and heartbreaking -- in the sentencing phase for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. The prosecution rested Thursday afternoon after attempting to convince jurors that Tsarnaev was cold-hearted and remorseless. The defense, led by famed death penalty opponent Judy Clarke, is expected to try to soften that portrayal by calling witnesses to explain Tsarnaev's difficult upbringing. Clarke will begin those efforts Monday. A group of Tsarnaev's relatives arrived at Boston's Logan International Airport on Thursday, CNN affiliate WHDH reported, but it's not clear if they plan to testify. The jury must decide whether the 21-year-old, who has been found guilty of perpetrating the attack with his now-deceased brother, will die for his crimes or spend his life in prison. Woolfenden, a biomedical researcher for the Novartis Institutes, recalled using his belt as a tourniquet on his leg and trying to comfort Leo. The boy cried, \"Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy! Mommy! Daddy!\" he testified. Amid the stench of \"burning hair, blood, sulfur,\" a good Samaritan emerged. He gave Woolfenden another tourniquet and rushed Leo to safety. \"I was completely terrified because I didn't know if I was ever going to see my son again. There was blood all over the sidewalk, all around me,\" he said. Dr. David King, a trauma surgeon at Massachusetts General Hospital, spent 14 years in the U.S. Army as a combat surgeon and served in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as in Haiti after the devastating 2010 earthquake. He has treated and operated on hundreds of troops injured by improvised explosive devices, he testified, and what he saw in Boston that day wasn't much different from the carnage he witnessed in war zones. \"I arrived just as the first wave of casualties had shown up,\" he said. \"I looked across the patients and I knew immediately, without anyone having to tell me, exactly what the wounding mechanism was.\" Heather Abbott had no such experience, so when one of the two bombs exploded, sending her through the doors of a restaurant and into a \"puddle of chaos and blood and glass,\" her instinct was to run. But she couldn't. Her foot felt like it was on fire, she testified. Two women helped her as she overheard someone saying a Hail Mary. She called for her husband. He picked her up and carried her out of the restaurant. \"I saw blood pouring out of my foot,\" she said. She finally got to a hospital, and after three attempts to save her foot, which was missing its entire heel, a doctor told her she had a decision: She could keep her leg and risk a life of excruciating pain or have it amputated below the knee. She chose the latter. \"It was probably the hardest decision I've had to make,\" she testified. Another marathon attendee rendered an amputee by the Tsarnaev brothers' attack, Marc Fucarile, recounted the two bombs going off. \"I stepped back, and the next thing I remember was looking up at the sky,\" he testified, adding that he remembered \"a lot of yelling, a lot of screaming, people crying out for tourniquets.\" A nurse was sitting on his chest, and someone said, \"Oh, s***, he's on fire!\" He tried to undo his belt and got a third-degree burn because the buckle was so hot. A firefighter would later tell Fucarile that he handed his own right leg to the firefighter. He doesn't remember that. In addition to treating him for severe burns over much of his body, doctors had to cut off a bone and stretch muscle over the stub so that a prosthetic would fit. He still gets blisters. \"So where the prosthetic attaches on your butt, it rubs and breaks down and creates open wounds,\" he said. And though his left leg survived, it was severely burned, his calf muscle was blown off and his heel was shattered, he said. He hopes to save the left leg, he testified, but it's likely that it will have to be amputated above the knee. He takes more than 70 pills -- 24 pills in morning, 22 in afternoon, 26 at night -- to cope with his injuries, he said. One of the most dramatic points in Thursday's testimony involved the death of young Martin Richard. The prosecution showed close-up video of the 8-year-old, who was only 3\u00bd feet from one of the bombs, according to the FBI's re-creation of the crime scene. His parents, Bill and Denise, are opposed to Tsarnaev receiving the death penalty and did not participate in the penalty phase, though Bill Richard did testify during the guilt phase. Dr. King told the court that Martin was especially vulnerable to the blast because he was so small and close to the ground, meaning the shrapnel more easily reached his head and torso. It's highly unlikely the boy died instantly, King said. Explaining that Martin died of rapid blood loss, King testified, \"Receptors are generally not responsive to cutting. If you happen to be awake and someone cuts your bowel or liver, it generally does not hurt. What hurts is the stretching and twisting. ... Intestines were pulled and twisted; that would have caused visceral type pain.\" Woolfenden, the biomedical researcher, recalled seeing Martin and his mother shortly after the good Samaritan took Woolfenden's son, Leo, to safety. \"I saw Martin's face, and I could see a boy that looked like he was fatally injured,\" he said, . Martin's hair was singed, his eyes had rolled back into his head and his mouth was agape. As for Martin's torso, \"I saw an immense amount of blood. I was really, really terrified,\" Woolfenden said. He recalled Denise Richard pleading with her son, saying, \"please\" and \"Martin\" over and over. Woolfenden placed his hand on Denise Richard's back, he said. She turned to ask Woolfenden if he was OK. He said he was, and she turned her attention back to Martin. But no response came. According to testimony, Martin's aorta was nearly severed and he was eviscerated by shrapnel from the blast. He bled to death on the sidewalk, and the last thing he probably felt was excruciating pain from the force of the blast twisting his internal organs.

{"question_id": 122, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)As thousands of South Africans took to the streets of the city of Durban to rally against violence and xenophobia, an online community has joined the protests. The marches follow recent violent attacks on foreigners in the country that have claimed five lives. During the protest march Thursday, Twitter followers voiced their support through hashtag campaigns. #PeaceMarch and #SayNoToXenophobia were some of the most popular. South African Police Services said more than 10,000 people attended the march, including civil rights groups and nongovernmental organizations. Hashtags are now pouring out of South Africa. But many are asking, some via Twitter, is it enough to fight #xenophobia? Attacks this week in Durban alone have killed two immigrants and three South Africans, including a 14-year-old boy, authorities said. For South African Tim Flack, tweeting wasn't going to make a bit of difference. Flack, who lives in Cape Town, has brought allegations of hate speech and human rights violations against Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini, who he said referred to foreigners as \"lice\" and has said \"they should pack their bags and go.\" \"People listen to him,\" Flack said. \"He is a monarch. The Zulu people in South Africa take him very seriously, they don't question what he says.\" Flack said he was motivated to make the allegations after seeing multiple complaints about xenophobic violence on social media and thinking they weren't enough. So he filed a complaint with the South African Human Rights Commission, and then tweeted about it. \"The activists sit around feeling accomplished because they retweeted five times,\" Flack said. \"I want to reach people who see that they can lay a charge and it won't cost them anything, but I will have done something to change the country and push it into a better state of being.\" Now, the Human Rights Commission must decide whether to investigate Flack's allegations against the King, who denies fueling any violence. Flack hopes others will also make complaints. Flack added that Zulus aren't the only people in South Africa who share in the xenophobic sentiment. \"People are frustrated and unemployed, and people in South Africa pay foreign nationals a lot less,\" he said of the tension between nationals and immigrants. \"A domestic worker would ask for 250 rand a day to clean a house, whereas a foreign national would ask for 150 rand, so it causes resentment.\" Imtiaz Sooliman, founder and chairman of the Gift of Givers Foundation in Durban, doesn't think most South Africans are against foreigners. \"South Africans are against xenophobia,\" said Sooliman, who insists the majority of the country is providing an overwhelming amount of support for foreign nationals. Gift of Givers has been administering assistance at five refugee camps set up by the South African government that now hold roughly 8,000 foreign national refugees, he said, passing out things like clothing and hygiene packs. The organization posts its work at the camps online and tags it on social media with #xenophobia. Why? \"In South Africa, everyone knows xenophobia,\" Sooliman said, \"and the way a disaster agency works is we post what people understand. So if you say #tsunami or #war, people follow it. So here, people say #xenophobia, and they all know what it is -- it is a disaster, so you are going to post what people understand.\" He said South Africans also have been going to the camps, which are on sports fields with makeshift tents, bringing cooked food and other necessities. \"This is different from what happened in 2008,\" Sooliman said. That year, scores were killed in attacks in the poorest areas of Johannesburg. Most of the victims were Zimbabweans who had fled repression and dire economic circumstances. Sooliman said that along with the government strongly condemning the violence, community engagement is happening now as it never happened before. It is a kind of national unity that can be best summed up with another hashtag that has emerged from this story: #WeAreAfrica. Only time, or, tweets will tell if it works.\n"]}

The Par-3 Contest has become a much-loved part of the Masters build-up, and is played on Augusta National\u2019s nine-hole par-3 course on the Wednesday before the tournament. American 36-year-old Kevin Streelman won the Par-3 contest after a three-hole play-off with Camilo Villegas. The pair both shot five under par, but the Colombian Villegas hit his tee shot on the eighth hole into the water during the play-off. McIlroy is desperate to win at Augusta this week and add the Masters, which is the only major he is yet to win, to his trophy collection and will get down to the serious business on Thursday. Victory at the Augusta National will mean a third major title in a row for the Northern Irishman, who shot a one-under-par round in the Par-3 Contest after winning The Open and the USPGA Championship at the back end of 2014. Woods, meanwhile,\u00a0had declined to participate in the mini-tournament, which he has previously called 'distracting',since 2004. But Woods gave his fans a treat by joining in with the event for the first time in 11 years, with his daughter, Sam, 7, and his son, Charlie, 6, keeping him company. His playing partners were old pals Steve Stricker and Fred Couples. Sam Snead won the first Par 3 Contest in 1960, two years after the course was completed. A record five holes-in-one were made in the 2002 event, when Japan's Toshi Izawa made back-to-back aces on holes five and six. Players often invite their wives or children to caddie for them.

'They can afford to have a blip and still win the league but on the flip side, we need to pick up every point we can.

'I think we shocked them that day,' he told Hoops Player. 'If we can show the same desire both on and off the pitch then hopefully we can get a result again.

Corey Edwards, from Teignmouth, Devon more than anything wanted to see his parents Craig, 28, and Jemma, 21, tie the knot. The five-year-old was diagnosed with a complex congenital heart defect at the age of seven months and since then has undergone eight open-heart operations and other treatments. Jemma and Craig Edwards listen to their wedding vows during their marriage at Bristol Children's Hospital . Corey Edwards' job was to hold the rings for his parents during the marriage ceremony . The five-year-old is suffering from a terminal congenital heart defect and had often asked his parents why they were not married . Corey has been on the paediatric intensive care unit at Bristol Children's Hospital since January and when doctors gave his parents the devastating news that he may not live much longer, Mr and Mrs Edwards decided to get married. They had been engaged for three years but plans to tie the knot were put on hold due to the birth of their daughters, two-year-old Isabelle and six-month-old Caitlyn, and Corey's ill health. When they learnt of their son's wish, they felt there was no time like the present and, with the help of staff and friends made at the hospital, they were able to organise the whole service within 48 hours. They made history when they became the first couple to marry at the hospital but had to get special permission from the Archbishop of Canterbury. The law allows couples to marry in hospital if one of them is desperately ill and that did not apply in this case. But a law dating back to Henry VIII gives the Archbishop of Canterbury special dispensation to allow weddings in hospital for 'pastoral reasons'. Mr Edwards, a council worker, said: 'A couple of weeks ago we were told they didn't think he would go home. We keep hoping that he will but it just looks less likely each day. 'When we knew Corey's wishes, everyone on the paediatric intensive care unit and Ward 32, including staff and friends, got together to help us. The Edwards had been engaged for three years but decided to fast track their wedding when they discovered their son Corey may not live much longer . 'We both planned to get married years ago but decided we wouldn't get married without Corey there, so the only way we could do it was in hospital. 'He's asked quite a few times why we are not married, so we thought we would make it a special day and cheer him up a bit. 'The Bishop of Bristol had to write to the Archbishop of Canterbury to get special permission for us to marry in the hospital and we are so grateful he agreed. 'When we got the go-ahead, we only had a matter of days to plan. We rushed into town to buy a dress and suit and made do with our engagement rings as wedding rings. 'We couldn't believe the generosity of all those involved. One nurse helped to do Jemma's hair, whilst another two members of staff made the cake and iced it. 'Chairs were pulled together to form an aisle and decorations were put up to make it feel like a wedding venue. 'We were married by the hospital's chaplain, Rev Stephen Oram, who was very excited to be sharing this occasion with us. 'However, the most important thing for us was having our son Corey at our side, holding the rings and wearing his suit. 'We couldn't have been more proud of him. We were also incredibly lucky to have our daughters there and the support of so many.' Mr Edwards added: 'It turned into a really, really amazing day and Corey was so proud. He looked very handsome. I think he really enjoyed it, which was the main thing. 'Getting married is usually the bride and groom's special day, which it was, but it's more Corey's special day because he is such a special boy. 'It was nice to share our special day with the people who have helped us enjoy Corey's short life. It has got to the point where there isn't more they can do now, which is obviously very hard. 'Instead of being at his bedside crying the whole time at least on that one day we had a real special day. We know he was happy that day. 'When he's home and well you wouldn't know he is a cardiac patient. He's happy, running around and loves to play.' William Booth, the paediatric intensive care unit matron, said: 'It was a privilege to share Craig and Jemma's special day with their children Corey, Isabelle and Caitlyn, family and friends. 'The whole hospital was abuzz with excitement and one of the nurses made and iced a cake, others brought in flowers and gifts for the newlyweds. 'Lots of the nursing and medical teams involved in Corey's care came in over the Easter break to share this special occasion with them all.' Pictured front from left to right on the wedding day is Corey Edwards and his sisters Isabelle and Caitlyn. Across the back is their mother Jemma, Reverend Stephen Oram and their father Craig Edwards . Rev Oram said: 'Henry VIII gave the then Archbishop of Canterbury this special power to by-pass the law. 'It was that ancient law from several hundred years ago that was enacted allowing Mr and Mrs Edwards to get married. It meant a little bit of paperwork to fill out but we were able to get that done in 48 hours. 'It was very emotional and it was emotional for many reasons. The family and the ward knew how special this was for them and it was fulfilling the wish of a dying child. 'It was also emotional because we knew the outcome for poor Corey isn't going to be a good outcome and everyone was just aware of the specialness of the day for Mr and Mrs Edwards and Corey.' The newlyweds spent their wedding night at their son's bedside and later returned to the Ronald McDonald House where they are staying whilst Corey is in hospital. Mr Edwards said: 'It may not have been the day we had initially planned in our heads but it didn't matter to us. 'To have our son there meant more than anything and it will be a day we will never forget. We can't thank the staff enough for what they have done for us and Corey and we would like them to know how much we appreciate their hard work and dedication.'

Nine members of the Liana's Ransom were scooped up by Coast Guard life boats on Tuesday, leaving the Canadian charter ship adrift 30 miles east of Portland, Coast Guard officials said. The tall ship reported having issues with the engines around 12.35 a.m. on Monday, and said the sails had become wrapped around the mast. Scroll down for video . Mid-sea rescue: Coast Guard life boats facilitated a rescue of crew members from the Liana's Ransom, who had to leap from the replica schooner . Two lifeboat crews were dispatched from Gloucester, Massachusetts, to try and tow the vessel to shore, but 10-foot swells caused a tow line to break. The crew was ordered to put on immersion suits and abandon the schooner, according to a press release from the Coast Guard. In a video of the rescue, a man in a jacket successfully makes the jump from the Liana's Ransom to the lifeboat as the two ships pitch in the rough seas. CBS reports crew member Luke Arbuckle came up short while attempting to make the jump to the Coast Guard ship. 'Apparently the ship separated just as I jumped over, and I ended up in the water,' Arbuckle said. Arbuckle's forehead struck the side of the boat while jumping, and he was rescued and transported by a Coast Guard helicopter to the hospital, where he was treated and later released. Safe and sound: The crew was reportedly dehydrated and seasick after being caught in choppy weather early Monday morning . Pulled out: Crew member Luke Arbuckle shorted the jump as the two boats tilted away from each other and struck his head against the boat before being airlifted to the hospital . Ahoy: The 85-foot-long ship was on its way to St Maarten in the Caribbean with nine crew members on its first voyage of the season . The 24-year-old captain of the Liana's Ransom, Ryan Tilley, was the last crew member to depart the drifting ship, his father, Joseph Tilley, wrote on the ship's Facebook page. 'Seeing the ship crippled, damaged and left floating there as we motored away with the Coast Guard was probably one of the worst moments of my life, but you have to put lives first,' Ryan told WCVB. The boat was towed to  Kittery Point Yacht Yard in Eliot, Massachusetts, on Tuesday evening where it will be repaired. The ship's website states the vessel was on its way to St Maarten, which was to be its new home port, when it lost engine power. The schooner, which has a 70-passenger capacity, was built to resemble ships used by privateers and pirates in the 1700s and is equipped with replica black powder cannons, according to the site.\n"]}

The Battle of Britain? The Falklands crisis? The Iraq War? Scroll down for video . Labour leader Ed Miliband confessed that he 'blubbed' during the British film Pride that centres on the 1984 miners' strike . No. It centres on the 1984 miners\u2019 strike and the plucky underdogs are a London-based group of gays and lesbians who travel to South Wales to express their solidarity with the local branch of the National Union of Mineworkers. Needless to say, the evil dictator who they\u2019re fighting is Margaret Thatcher. Miliband received a lot of praise for admitting that he had a weep . What a surprise that such a storyline led the Labour leader to exclaim: \u2018Justine [his wife] and I watched it recently and blubbed.\u2019 I\u2019m sure Pride isn\u2019t the only British film that the right-on Milibands will have cried their way through. For there have been so many over recent years that mythologised the \u2018brave and downtrodden\u2019 workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories. In truth, these movies \u2014 Pride, Billy Elliot (also a piece of miners\u2019 strike propaganda that depicted Thatcher as the Devil incarnate), Made In Dagenham (about a car factory strike) and The Full Monty (about a group of redundant Sheffield steelworkers forced to strip naked to make money) \u2014might as well have been party political broadcasts for Labour. For the keystone of these Left-wing propaganda films is a pernicious rewriting of history, portraying Britain\u2019s recent past as a battle between heroic trade unionists, fighting to defend the poor and the vulnerable, and unfeeling bosses, bulldozing everything in their path in the ruthless pursuit of making money for their capitalist overlords. There is no acknowledgment by the film-makers that the unions\u2019 greed and bully-boy tactics all but destroyed the British economy, or that their beloved welfare state (which has actually created a terrible dependency culture in many parts of the country) relies on a strong, unsabotaged economy to keep it afloat. The film Pride achieves a double whammy by venerating not one but two sacred cows of the Left: bolshie unions and minorities (in this case, homosexuals). Naturally, it doesn\u2019t take long for the union bosses to recognise that the life-and-death struggle faced by gays and lesbians is very similar to that of their Welsh colliery members. Scroll down for video . Wringing every drop of emotion from Left-wing audiences, the director ends the film with a scene showing bus-loads of miners turning up to support a gay pride march in London\u2019s Hyde Park, as singer Billy Bragg\u2019s There Is Power In A Union comes blasting over the soundtrack. Strangely absent from the story, of course, is any reference to the role the NUM played in bringing down successive British governments \u2014 both Conservative and Labour alike \u2014 and its contribution to the terrible industrial unrest that gripped Britain in the Seventies and culminated in the Winter of Discontent. Nor is there any mention of the attempt by Arthur Scargill, the loony-Left leader of the NUM, to persuade communist Russia \u2014 not to mention Colonel Gaddafi \u2014 to bankroll the strike, which his members hadn\u2019t even had the right to vote for in a fair ballot. Billy Elliott is another film about \u2018brave and downtrodden\u2019 workers whose lives are made miserable by the Tories . The same historical revisionism is exhibited in Made In Dagenham, about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. As with Pride, the dramatic heart of the story is a conflict between two groups of Left-wing activists who gradually learn to make common cause \u2014 in this case, male and female shop-floor workers. At no point in the film is any sympathy shown towards the employers struggling to keep the firm competitive. The viewer is expected to assume that the demands of the strikers are completely justified. Made In Dagenham\u2019s political message couldn\u2019t be clearer, and it ends on a triumphant note with the passing of the Equal Pay Act by a Labour government in 1970. A more honest assessment of the British car industry would have featured the way union firebrands such as Derek Robinson \u2014 \u2018Red Robbo\u2019 \u2014 at British Leyland helped to destroy it and did so much damage to the economy at large. Indeed, a more realistic ending to Made In Dagenham would have pointed out that the Ford factory which once employed 40,000 people now has fewer than 4,000, thanks, in part, to rising labour costs \u2014 pushed up by militant unions. Brassed off starring Pete Postlethwaite and Ewan McGregor portrayed Margaret Thatcher as an orge . Then again, that would have meant acknowledging the inconvenient truth that the trade unions played a big role in the postwar decline of Britain\u2019s industrial base. Perhaps the most glaring omission from such Left-wing propaganda movies is any concession that the policies of Margaret Thatcher were a necessary corrective to the chaos and pessimism of the Seventies. The fact is that her government inherited a country on the brink of political and economic collapse and restored it to rude good health, able to hold its head up high again in the world. But in so many Left-inspired British films of the past 25 years, whether Brassed Off (about a colliery band facing the closure of their coalmine by a Tory government), The Full Monty or Billy Elliot, Thatcher is portrayed as a wrecking ball determined to destroy traditional working-class communities and replace nice Left-wing values with nasty Right-wing ones. Inevitably, the period before Thatcher is depicted as a golden age, a pastoral idyll straight out of a Hovis commercial, while the Britain she left behind is portrayed as a money-grubbing spiritual wasteland. Is it any wonder that such films make Ed Miliband, brought up by a Marxist academic father, \u2018blub\u2019? The only exception to this disgraceful series of truth-twisting films was The Iron Lady, in which Britain\u2019s first female Prime Minister was shown in a more nuanced light, almost in spite of its makers\u2019 Left-wing instincts. Made In Dagenham is about women workers walking out on strike at the Ford car factory in East London in 1968, demanding equal pay with male employees. It is broadly unsympathetic \u2014 there are plenty of scenes in which she is seen to be suffering from dementia, which suggests an element of hostility \u2014 but actress Meryl Streep brings such depth and humanity to the lead role that Baroness Thatcher emerges as a more complex figure than the bogeyman of Left-wing mythology. Not surprisingly, The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being \u2018shallow\u2019 and \u2018superficial\u2019, an example of \u2018self-important\u2019 film-making. No doubt if it had depicted Thatcher as a cruel monster, the same critics would have acclaimed it an out-and-out masterpiece. But not to worry. This mistake was corrected the following year by Labour-supporting Danny Boyle. In his lavish \u00a327 million opening ceremony for the London 2012 Olympics he made no direct reference to Britain\u2019s greatest postwar Prime Minister \u2014 which was odd in itself \u2014 but left viewers in no doubt about his view of Thatcherism. Once again we were treated to the familiar Left-wing version of Britain\u2019s history, in which top-hatted Tory industrialists, determined to despoil the country with dark satanic mills, are stopped in their tracks by an alliance of suffragettes, trade unionists and lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender activists. Boyle\u2019s collaborator, Frank Cottrell Boyce, condemned Thatcher for being \u2018insufficiently British\u2019 and said \u2018although she draped herself in the Union Flag, she never seemed to understand this country\u2019. The Iron Lady was condemned by many in the British film establishment for being \u2018shallow\u2019 and \u2018superficial\u2019, an example of \u2018self-important\u2019 film-making . The truth is, it\u2019s the Left that doesn\u2019t understand contemporary Britain. We are not a drab, depressed country, riven with class divisions and grotesque inequality, as you would think from watching films such as Pride and Billy Elliot. On the contrary, crime is lower, life expectancy higher and the standard of living better than at any time in our past. The rights of women, gays and ethnic minorities are all robustly defended by politicians of both Left and Right, and our schools and hospitals have never been better (or more lavishly funded). Britain now has the fastest-growing economy in the Western world, with more jobs being created last year in Yorkshire \u2014 ironically, the county where so many of these Left-wing propaganda films have been set \u2014 than in the whole of France. Couldn\u2019t we have just one home-grown film that celebrates the miracle that is modern Britain and brings a tear of pride to us all, rather than Left-wing drivel that triggers \u2018blubbing\u2019 from Ed Miliband?\n"]}

Aitor Karanka would surely have made his defenders walk home from Watford were it not for the probability they\u2019d spend most of the journey travelling in circles. This was that kind of game, a top-of-the-table occasion when Middlesbrough needed to deliver but ultimately failed on every scale \u2013 they did not create, they did not contain. They might have survived with deficiencies in one department, but not both. What a cruel time to deliver one of their worst performances of a brilliant season. What a cruel time for the Championship\u2019s best defence to explode at the seams. Odion Ighalo's shot flies into the top corner of Dimi Konstantopoulos' net on 65 minutes . Watford (3-5-2): Gomes; Cathcart (Connolly 60), Angella, Hoban; Paredes, Guedioura (Layun 90), Watson, Tozser, Anya; Deeney, Ighalo (Vydra 69). Subs not used:\u00a0Bond, Pudil, Munari, Abdi. Booked: Guedioura, Layun. Goals: Deeney 37, Ighalo 65.

Subs not used:\u00a0Ripley, Gibson, Whitehead, Vossen. Booked: Reach. Referee:\u00a0Mike Jones (Cheshire) Attendance: 19,656. They gifted Troy Deeney his 20th goal of the season and they contributed significantly to Odion Ighalo scoring his 19th in the second half. With that, Watford rose and Middlesbrough fell. That has been the way of this remarkable season in this peculiar division, for which everyone and no-one has staked a claim. The Championship lead which Boro held at the start of play has now changed hands 16 times, with Watford back in prominence and Karanka sounding like a man searching for a positive note. Karanka said: \u2018The players are completely destroyed but I am very proud of them. We have players who have come from League One and other teams in the Championship, a lot of young players, and we are fighting with the best teams in the Championship. No one could have expected this position. \u2018The people who know me and this team know we will fight to the last second. I don\u2019t want to forget our position is amazing.\u2019 True enough, but the reality is Boro have a chance to turn a good season into multi-million pound jackpot. They were woeful in falling at Bournemouth last month and have now lost four of their past five away games. Jonathan Woodgate slides in vain to try and block Troy Deeney's opening goal . The Watford captain managed to slide the ball under Boro keeper Dimi Konstantopoulos . Deeney celebrates with his team-mates after giving Watford a first-half lead . But their misery has been Watford\u2019s gain. What a luxury to have two strikers as effective as Deeney and Ighalo. They were, as Karanka said, \u2018the difference\u2019. And in the context of the season, their combined 39 goals are pulling the sleigh. Here, they had help. In the first instance, for Deeney\u2019s 37th-minute opener, Jonathan Woodgate and Dwight Tiendalli made a hash of the basics. Adlene Guedioura was given too much time to cross from the right and Woodgate misread the flight, allowing the ball to fall in the space behind him. Tiendalli could have covered but was out of position. At this level, in that situation, there can be fewer worse sights for a pair of defenders than Deeney. His touch was perfect and so was the finish - ruthless brilliance from a striker who has now scored 20 goals in each of his past three campaigns. He is the only Watford player in history to do that; he more than most deserves a chance to see what he can do at the higher level. \u2018He\u2019s a Premier League player,\u2019 said Watford manager Slavisa Jokanovic. \u2018It\u2019s just a question of whether we are all together as a Premier League team.\u2019 Watford made it 2-0 with 25 minutes to go. Again, the ease with which Ighalo turned Woodgate will have bothered Karanka, as will Grant Leadbitter\u2019s sloppy concession of the ball in the build-up. But, really, it was all about the finish, the striker\u2019s shot hitting the top corner from the edge of the area. Ighalo said he only joined Watford for the prospect of Premier League football. He might just get it. Jokanovic said: \u2018I expect this victory can help us to win points a little bit more easily in the future. But in front of us is a very serious job.\u2019 Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes gets a boot to the face from Middlesbrough forward Patrick bamford .

{"question_id": 129, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Two Maryland parents whose hands-off 'free-range' parenting got their children picked up by police yet again on Sunday are now vowing to file a lawsuit. Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their son Rafi, 10, and daughter Dvora, 6, roam free in their suburban neighborhood. But the Meitivs, both of them scientists, say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up Rafi and Dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents. Picked up: Officials seized Dvora, 6, (far left) and 10-year-old Rafi (left, blue hat) on Sunday in a Maryland park. The parents\u00a0Danielle and Alexander Meitiv (right) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours . Attorney Matthew Dowd, of the firm Wiley Rein, is representing the Meitivs and on Tuesday sent a ointed letter regarding Sunday's events. Rein wrote: . 'The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children. 'This fundamental, constitutional right of parents cannot be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent\u2019s reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children.' The firm declined to say who the suit would be against, exactly, when asked by the Washington Post. However, the attorney has vowed to pursue 'all legal remedies' to protect the rights of the Maryland parents. The Meitivs made headlines just before Christmas when police found Rafi and Dvora walking the sidewalk on their own. Picked up AGAIN: The Meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by CPS workers after their children--who they raise with a so-called 'free-range' approach--were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone . 'Besides the policeman pulling up...no': Asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal Sunday, 10-year-old Rafi admitted he was, but not because he'd been left alone with his sister . Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC\u00a0that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. \u2018They kept the kids for hours,\u2019 a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. \u2018It\u2019s 10:30 at night. They\u2019ve been missing since 6 o\u2019clock\u2026Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn\u2019t call us.\u2019 According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . \u2018The policeman said \u201cWe\u2019ll give you a ride home\u201d when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said \u201cI\u2019ll bring you home\u201d and, instead, he brought us here.\u2019 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . \u2018They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I\u2019m not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action.\n"]}

{"question_id": 132, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)The public outrage over the \"religious freedom\" bills recently passed in Arkansas and Indiana caught the governors of those states completely off-guard, judging by their confused and contradictory responses. As poll watchers, they surely knew that most Americans now oppose the discriminatory laws and practices they accepted as normal only a dozen years ago. But the politicians underestimated the pushback organized by local and national businesses, including companies with no previous record of public support for social equality. They had better adjust to a new reality. For the past three decades, socially conservative evangelicals and pro-business interests have been powerfully allied against government regulations, environmental initiatives and social welfare programs, while supporting lower taxes for the wealthy and pushing back against the growing diversity in America's population. For many, this alliance been puzzling: Other, equally devout Christians who place more emphasis on Jesus Christ's message of unconditional love and on his denunciations of excessive wealth and neglect of the poor, have been uncomfortable with it, as have many business leaders. Their priorities, after all, are based on the bottom line. And companies that sell goods and services to the public are learning that support for discrimination -- or even passive acceptance of it -- threatens that bottom line. Hence, after Indiana Gov. Mike Pence signed a law that opened a new door for discrimination against same-sex couples, the threat of boycotts and other retaliation was swift, from groups as diverse as the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Indiana Pacers, Walmart, Eli Lilly, Apple and even the Marriott International hotel chain. Marriott International was founded by J.W. Marriott, a dedicated Mormon, and is now run by his son Bill, also a Mormon who fully accepts his church's teachings about traditional marriage.  Yet in June, Marriott International launched a \"#Love Travels\" marketing campaign, aimed at attracting lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender travelers with an assurance of \"the company's commitment to make everyone feel comfortable about who they are.\" Asked about the discrepancy between his religious rejection of same-sex marriage and his marketing overtures to same-sex honeymooners, Marriott pointed to the Bible's injunction of unconditional love, but added \"beyond that, I am very careful about separating my personal faith and beliefs from how we run our business.\" In 2014, global spending by LGBT travelers was estimated at more than $200 billion, and spending by this market segment is rising much faster than overall spending on travel. So Marriott worries when states start to make such travelers feel unwelcome. Businesses seeking to develop brand loyalty among younger consumers have a special incentive to highlight their rejection of anti-gay bias.  A CNN poll taken in February found that 72% of millennials nationwide believe that same-sex couples have the right to have their marriages recognized as valid.  Even among white evangelical Protestants, 43% of millennials support same-sex marriage, compared with less than 20% of those their grandparents' age, 68 and older. It used to be that businesses could close their eyes to discrimination in areas geographically isolated from the more liberal coasts, but that is no longer possible. According to researchers for MTV's \"Look Different\" anti-bias campaign, 90% of youths aged 14 to 24 agree that it is important to make their communities a less biased place, and almost 80% say that everyone has a responsibility to help tackle bias. So who's the \"moral majority\" now? For media-savvy millennials, following that moral imperative means spreading the news about discrimination wherever it occurs and reaching beyond geographic boundaries to mobilize against it. In the first 24 hours after Arkansas passed its version of the \"religious freedom\" bill, the Twitter hashtag #BoycottArkansas was used 12,000 times. It then snowballed after celebrity blogger Perez Hilton tweeted it to his 5.9 million Twitter followers. America has crossed a threshold where it is no longer a good business model or political strategy to be intolerant of diversity, whether that pertains to race, ethnicity, gender or sexual orientation. Since 2011, the majority of children that have been born in the United States each year are members of racial or ethnic minorities.  Hispanics are projected to account for most of the growth in the labor force between now and 2060. Women now lead men in educational attainment. And more than half of Americans live in states where same-sex marriage is legal. Business leaders and politicians who ignore or offend these constituencies do so at their own peril.\n"]}
{"question_id": 133, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: It is seen as extremely rude in most human societies, but it appears apes also use whispers to pass on information they do not want others to hear. Gibbons - better known for their deafening songs that reverberate around the forests they inhabit - have been found to regularly use the secretive form of communication. The apes, which are found in the forest of south east Asia, produce a variety of soft call types, known as 'hoos', that are almost inaudible to the human ear. Scroll down for video . Lars gibbons like this one in Khao Yai National Park Thailand use soft 'hoo' calls that are similar to whispers . Yet scientists have found the animals use these whispers to communicate specific information to each other about predators, foraging and when meeting neighbours. The researchers found that predator 'hoos' in particular were produced at frequencies well below the threshold of hearing for eagles and other birds of prey. A dictionary that decodes the calls produced by gibbons is being developed by scientists. Researchers at Wisconsin University in Madison have been using computer algorithms to analyse the whoops and songs produced by the apes. Gibbons singing usually consists of a crescendo of notes, particularly in response to predators. This usually starts with a series of soft 'hoo' noises that are only audible at close range but this rapidly grows to become much louder. In most studied cases these songs are produced in response to predators but they also duet together in social song. This suggests the quiet calls were designed to alert other gibbons nearby without alerting the raptors. Similarly biologists studying lar gibbons found they used a different whisper call to when a tiger or leopard was in the area. Dr Esther Clarke, who led the research at the University of Durham, said the findings could also help to provide valuable clues about human speech evolved and perhaps even why humans began using whispers. She told Mail Online: '(Hoo calls) have been overlooked in favour of the more conspicuous songs. 'We just didn't know they were using context-specific calls at close range. 'It opens up the possibility that their vocal repertoire is much larger than we previously imagined.' She added:\u00a0'These animals are extraordinarily vocal creatures and give us the rare opportunity to study the evolution of complex vocal communication in a non-human primate. 'In the future, gibbon vocalisations may reveal much about the processes that shape vocal communication, and because they are an ape species, they may be one of our best hopes at tracing the evolution of human communication.' Gibbons have one of the loudest calls in the natural world, creating whoops that can travel for miles through the dense forests where they live. Most research until now has concentrated on their loud songs which the animals use to communicate with each other over long distances. However, Dr Clarke and her team, whose work is published in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology, decided to focus on the softer hoo call types. While these calls have been known about since the 1940s, they have not been studied in detail due to their low volume and because they are almost indistinguishable to the human ear. Lar gibbons used hoo calls to warn each other of predators but also during more intimate moments like this . The researchers used models like of this snake to test whether certain hoo calls were specific to predators . Different hoo calls appeared to be related to the activity the gibbons were taking part in like foraging (above) Using modern recording technology and computer analysis, Dr Clarke and her colleagues have been able to detect subtle differences in frequency, pitch, length and volume of these calls. They recorded 450 hoo sounds and found there were six different types of calls being produced by the gibbons. The researchers have been able to identify which of these calls are associated with particular situations. The researchers spent almost four months following lar gibbons around the forests of Mo Singto in Khao Yai National Park, north east Thailand recording their calls and behaviour. They found that the gibbons produced individual hoo calls in different situations, including when they were foraging, when they encountered neighbours, during duet songs between paired mates and when they detected predators. This model of a bird of prey produced short, low frequency and extremely quiet calls from the gibbons . This model of a leopard also produced low frequency and quiet calls from the gibbons when they spotted it . The researchers used a series of models of predators to test whether the calls were associated with specific predators. They found raptor hoos were less intense, shorter, lower pitch and had a small frequency span. They were the least audible of the calls. Raptors hear best in the 1-4kHz range while the gibbon hoos were consistently below the 1kHz threshold. Tiger and leopard hoos were similar, suggesting that callers perceived these two predators as belonging to the same \u2018big cat\u2019 class. While both gibbon sexes displayed similar hoo calls, female calls were lower in frequency than male ones. The researchers say this is surprising, as among mammals, males tend to have lower frequency voices than females. Females also typically did not produce hoo vocalisations when encountering neighbours and often remained passive. This video shows a white handed gibbon singing the more distinctive and audible calls while in a zoo enclosure . Males, however, often interacted with neighbouring individuals. The gibbons also seemed to use whispering during more intimate moments - much like humans do too. Writing in the journal BMC Evolutionary Biology, Dr Clarke and her colleagues said: 'Duet hoos tended to be higher in frequency than the other contexts, significantly so when compared with feeding,leopard, tiger and raptor hoos and raptor and tiger hoos.' The researchers say the study is of direct relevance for the on-going debate about the evolution of human speech. Researchers say the findings could shed light on the evolution of human speech and why we began whispering . The ability to produce calls that are context-specific is necessary for communication to direct the attention of others. This behaviour appears to be widespread and was likely present in the ancestor of modern primates and humans. The acoustic variation seen in gibbon hoos in particular may be similar to human speech, in which subtle acoustic parameters, like pitch, can be important carriers of meaning. Chimpanzees bash out distinctive drum solos on the roots of trees as a form of 'signature' and to tell others in their group where they are. Biologists studying the primates have found over the years that male chimps grip the buttresses of tree roots with their hands and beat them with their feet. The noises produced - which is normally accompanied with loud hooting - \u00a0are known as pant calls, and can be heard more than half a mile (1km) away, even in the dense jungle. But now one group of scientists studying the animal in the Sonso Community in the Budongo Forest in Uganda, have found that this drumming contains distinctive rhythmic patterns that can be used to identify a specific individual. Each male used a different number of beats and used a style of doublets and pauses that was distinct to them. The researchers also discovered that the chimps tended to use drumming far more often when their group was travelling. They believe this may help keeps tabs on an individual's whereabouts.\n"]}

The news of his arrival was met with much excitement and hysteria from his Australian fans, who make up a hefty chunk of his 498,000 Instagram fans. Some allegedly have even been following the model to his hotel. 'You just have to take it in your stride to be honest,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'Like today for example, I just went about doing my modelling job and it just happens to be that you have to deal with it [the fame] when it comes up in that moment.' Humbled heart throb: Despite rubbing shoulders with Madonna, model Stephen James remains very humble . The ladies of Australia may be in luck if thye manage to catch the busy model's eye. 'I'm only recently single - it's not bad, I'm having fun,' he revealed. For Hardy, tattoos were never about impressing people or gaining popularity amongst the tatt loving community - he says it's always been about expression, art and staying grounded. 'They're all about different experiences and things that have happened in my life. One of my favourite tattoos for example is of Morrissey, as I listened to The Smiths a lot growing up.' Single and ready to mingle: British supermodel Stephen James said he is recently unattached and having fun . When quizzed about the Hindu face that covers his torso, Hendry admits it comes from a deeply, personal place, despite the ridiculing tongue poking out that might suggest otherwise. 'It's about a private moment in my life when I needed more balance,' he said. 'It features symbols from Hinduism, with the tridents acting as a symbol of protection. It also reflects mandalas in my head and is a way for me to express it and keep balance.' He likens it to a guiding spirit in his life, as a sort-of expression of his religion and a constant reminder to keep his sanity grounded. No time to waste: Hendry says while fame has happened quickly he plans to just run with it and look back later . 'With fame and all the pressures of having these expectations of being the person you\u2019re meant to be, well this is my own little thing to hide behind.' And if the humbled heart throb, couldn't make girls swoon anymore, he is a big fan of poetry and has portrait tattoos of Oscar Wilde and artist Frida Kahlo, not just because he \u00a0likes them but thinks there's more to them than a face. 'I'd rather have a picture of their face, even though Frida Kahlo has one eyebrow, it's about liking them for on the inside, not judging about what they're like on the outside.' Fan girl mania: English supermodel Stephen James whose famous for his tattoos has landed in Sydney . And while he adds Sydney is very cool and suited to his lifestyle, his time here will be brief as he works on a campaign with shoe label Windsor Smith before jetting off to Adelaide - where for lucky South\u00a0Australians\u00a0he will be doing in-store appearances. While Hendry has a busy time ahead of him, he's excited to just take it and run with it. 'Right now everything in my life is happening so quick, in a year I've become one of the top models and have one of the largest social followings for a model on Instagram. But for now I just like to take it in my stride,' he said. 'Maybe when it\u2019s all over I can be like, \"wow!\"'\n"]}

The lunar event - where Earth's shadow completely blocks the moon - lasted only five minutes, making it the shortest eclipse of the century, NASA said. The so-called 'blood moon' could be seen by billions of people across the western U.S., Canada and Australia. Scroll down for video . Blood moon: Skygazers in the western U.S., Canada, Australia and New Zealand were treated to a total eclipse of the moon before dawn on Saturday (pictured over New Zealand) The eclipse is the third in a series of four blood moons, with the final one expected on September 28. The next one will be visible from Europe. The best spot this morning was at the Mississippi River, where spectators caught the entire five minutes of the orb around 5am PT, astronomers said. Sky-gazers in the Midwest and East Coast only caught part of the lunar show. The eclipse could also be seen in its entirety on Saturday night from eastern Australia, New Zealand and Japan. But observatory staff in Sydney were unable to see the eclipse due to cloudy weather and instead wrote on Twitter: 'Our live feed from the Griffith Observatory [in America] is showing gorgeous totality pink!' Don't blink! The moon may have shone red for three hours but it was only visible to citizens for five minutes (pictured over New Zealand) On the west coast of North America, the total eclipse \u2014 what astronomers call totality \u2014 began shortly before 5am PT . They accompanied their tweet with a picture of a bright pink moon. 'Blood moon' refers to its orange or red appearance, which is the result of sunlight scattering off Earth's atmosphere. Whether the moon appears dark red, copper, bronze or another shade depends on several factors including the amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere. Unlike more lengthy eclipses, the moon in this case only skimmed the upper part of Earth's shadow. Normally, the moon passes through the middle of the shadow, making the eclipse lasts longer. Sydney Observatory astronomer Andrew Smith said before the event: 'Some sources indicate it will be around 10 minutes of totality, which will make it the shortest since 1917, but other sources say it will be less than five minutes which makes it the shortest since 1592.' 'Blood moon' refers to its orange or red appearance \u2014 the result of sunlight scattering off Earth's atmosphere, seen here in Santa Barbara . Unlike solar eclipses which require eye protection, you only need clear skies to view this lunar eclipse (pictured over Santa Barbara) Whether the moon appears dark red, copper or bronze depends on several factors including the amount of volcanic ash in the atmosphere . As well as California, the eclipse could also be seen in its entirety on Saturday night from eastern Australia, New Zealand and Japan . The total lunar eclipse is observed above cherry blossoms in Shiraishi city, Miyagi district, northeastern Japan on Saturday . Geoff Chester of the U.S. Naval Observatory in Washington added that it was the changes in colour that makes lunar eclipses so interesting. The full eclipse of the moon in September will be visible across the U.S. and Canada, as well as western Europe and Africa. 'Totality' will last around an hour and 20 minutes. But those who missed out in Australia will have to wait until January 31, 2018, for the next lunar eclipse. Unlike solar eclipses which require eye protection, you only need clear skies to view a lunar eclipse. A pair of binoculars or backyard telescope will enhance your view, but are not necessary. Japanese sky-gazers caught the moon when it was still white and out of the Earth's shadow . It is the third of four consecutive lunar eclipses separated by six months - a tetrad - which is very rare . Atmospheric: The sky (pictured in Japan) burned a deep red as the gleaming orange light shone through the clouds . In New York, where the sun was rising, the sky glared orange from the reflection of the sun's rays from the moon . The full moon is seen over the Santa Monica Mountains in Topanga, California, shortly before it turns red during the lunar eclipse . The moon is seen behind downtown high-rise buildings during the shortest total lunar eclipse of the century before dawn . Sky-gazers will have a better chance of catching the next full lunar eclipse on September 28, that will last over an hour .\n"]}

Fake tanning had become part of many women\u2019s regular beauty regime thanks to its popularity among celebrities such as former Spice Girl Victoria Beckham, the stars on Strictly Come Dancing and the cast \u2013 both male and female \u2013 of reality TV show The Only Way Is Essex. But even the TOWIE crew themselves admit the look can easily go wrong. Sam Faiers, who was a brand ambassador for Fake Bake, has described her horror at looking unnaturally orange on occasion. Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, pictured (above) at the 87th annual Academy Awards, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow . She said: \u2018Just before Christmas I overdid it with the fake tan. I made my legs too dark and I just thought, what have I done?!\u2019 Other TOWIE performers have admitted similar errors, including Lauren Goodger, who was a particularly vivid colour when attending a Woman\u2019s Own event last year. Even the programme itself has ridiculed the dangers of fake tan. Charlie Sims became a laughing stock after emerging from a spay tan session designed to improve his appearance and self-esteem only to look like an orange extra from the famous Tango TV commercials. His sister, Chloe Sims, famously stripped off to be the face and body of Montana Tan\u2019s Starship Range. Georgia Percy, from Kantar Worldpanel, said sales of artificial tanning products were the hardest hit sub-sector of the suncare market in 2014. \u2018As with total suncare, the key contributor to decline was fewer shoppers, suggesting women are tending towards a more natural look,\u2019 she said. Lou Ellerton, of consultants the Value Engineers, told The Grocer magazine: \u2018Reality TV shows were effectively ongoing ads for fake tan but they passed their peak. 'It\u2019s like fake tan has been off the air for a while.\u2019 Pale skin icons include the likes of Keira Knightley, Cara Delevingne and Gwyneth Paltrow. The weather has also played a part, she said. \u2018If skin is not on show, why dress it up?\u2019\n"]}
{"question_id": 144, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Two goals within ninety seconds of each other was enough to spark an outbreak of fear and loathing rarely seen on this side of the Mersey. After more than two years of inexorable decline the patience of Tranmere's faithful finally snapped when Oxford moved decisively ahead, in an effortless manner reminiscent of the previous Saturday's Boat Race. The loathing was directed mainly at manager Micky Adams, who was announced on Sunday morning to have left the club by 'mutual consent'. The Tranmere players look down after the final whistle, as the prospect of relegation looms large . This is how it ends in football sometimes: standing in the dugout having a season ticket thrown in your face by an incandescent supporter, who you then see given a standing ovation by some sections upon being escorted out. The fear involves dropping out of the Football League a week on Saturday after 94 years of membership, something which provoked an angry demonstration by some 150 supporters outside the gates afterwards. Adams departs with two games to go and after a 3-0 defeat against a thoroughly professional Oxford side the Wirral's only professional sports outfit are one point behind Cheltenham and two behind Hartlepool. Bitter ironies abound. Relegation to the National League \u2013 the grand-sounding new title for the Conference but don't be fooled \u2013 may partly be down to Prenton Park legend and ex-manager Ronnie Moore, sacked by the club last season for a minor betting offence, and now masterminding Hartlepool's unlikely survival. And it could all happen under the ownership of former FA Chief Executive Mark Palios, knowledgeable football man and esteemed former Tranmere player who took over the club late last summer. Kemar Roofe celebrates scoring, as a professional Oxford side eased past sorry Tranmere . The battle between Barnet and Bristol Rovers to win automatic promotion to the Football League will go down to the last game. Barnet, who lead the Conference by one point, have a home game against mid-table Gateshead on Saturday while Rovers face a potentially more difficult match at home against fourth from bottom Alfreton, who almost certainly need to win themselves to avoid being relegated. Rovers looked as if they would head the table after the weekend\u2019s games but conceded a goal with two minutes left to draw 1-1 at Dover. That put Barnet, who dropped out of the Football League two seasons ago, in the driving seat after a 1-1 draw away to Kidderminster. Grimsby are guaranteed a play-off spot, but one of Eastleigh, Forest Green and Macclesfield will miss out. It all seemed such a good idea at the time. Nobody questioned his judgement in October when, with the team bottom of the table, he replaced the inexperienced Rob Edwards with a seasoned operator like Adams. There was the odd dead cat bounce, but six months on they are still bottom after failing to keep a clean sheet for nineteen consecutive matches. The Mersey ferry displays a quicker turning circle than that shown by the home defence for the two killer goals that came just after half-time, but then a cause of that may be a lack of familiarity among players. A staggering 52 have been called up to first team duty this season. Adams played the selection and recruitment game like a man on the fruit machine, continually pulling the handle in the hope that the right combination would come up in alignment. The latest loan signing has been young Everton winger George Green who, when pulled off on Saturday after 60 minutes, could be seen haranguing some of his team-mates on the bench. It was not long after full-time that you could catch assistant manager Alan Rogers, part of a distinguished list of former Tranmere players who graduated to a higher level, stripping the paint from the dressing room walls. Micky Adams has left the club by mutual consent, with Tranmere bottom of the league with two games to go . Rogers \u2013 now in charge for the next fortnight \u2013 then had to deny that Adams's decision to dodge the media was of any significance. He then professed himself 'dumbfounded' by the team's performance. And so it unravels in desperate times. They had actually competed gamely in the first half, but were overwhelmed by anxiety when getting anywhere near the goal. 'It's not acceptable,' he said. 'We just don't look like scoring a goal. The players have got to start taking some responsibility. It's an easy option pointing fingers at the manager but the players have got to look at themselves, have they done enough? The answer is no. I was a player. You've got to stand up and be counted.' Marc Laird, well-travelled journeyman and among those fighting for his career, did not try to shift the blame onto the management. He just about summed up the sense of disbelief saying: 'It's a big club, when I joined in the summer I never imagined that we would be where we are.' The prospect of dropping out of the 92 is something uniquely grim in English football, especially for a club of this heritage, who shortly after joining the league gave a debut to 16 year-old local lad Dixie Dean. It was only in January 2013 that they stood on top of League One and early in the last decade reached the League Cup final plus three FA Cup sixth rounds. But they do not have to look far for examples of how there is no easy road back in the event of relegation. Aside from Southport and Chester there is Wrexham, not far across the Welsh border and a decent sized club, who fell out of the league in 2008 and have yet to return. There is a long trip to Plymouth next Saturday and then a last home game against Bury. The unpalatable odds are that the next stop after that could be somewhere like Braintree or Dover.\n"]}

'Anyone between 10 and 65 years of age is eligible to participate in the ritual,' he added. 'We are not scared. My parents and friends have been doing it for years now. No one ever has been hurt...,God Shiv and Goddess Parvati watches over us,' the villager went on to say. Mr Nayak said he enjoys the thrill of hanging over the fire and feels proud to be one of the participants.

Raju Sahu, 40, who has been participating in the ritual for last 40 years, believes the ritual is important for the betterment of the community. 'If we don't perform the rituals anything can happen. In my lifetime I have never missed to participate and my children will follow me,' says Sahu.

Devotees from all over eastern India flock the venue. Baffled on-lookers gather around the fire to catch a glimpse of participants performing this 'miracle'. The villagers claim the festival is being celebrated from thousands of years, however they say now the duration has been trimmed because of rapid urbanisation in the area. 'In fact, they have also made amendments to the ritual. Earlier a participant was hanged with an iron hook inserted into his flesh, which now has been replaced with tying with a cloth,' said one of the villagers who had come to watch the ritual. Vijay Kumar Sahu, 63, who has been organising the festival for the past 52 years, also fears that there had been too many changes made in the ritual. 'People are making it easier now and follow only what suits them. I fear this ritual would gradually be phased out or at worst invite god's wrath,' said Sahu.\n"]}

The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club has quickly become one of Britain's most elite sporting venues since The Prince of Wales joined when it was founded in 1982. It's attracted royals and celebrities including Prince William and Harry, actress Stephanie Powers and Rolling Stone Bill Wyman. But attempts to cash in on this elite status by launching a brand of fashion and polo-related goods have been scuppered by the European Court after objections fromthe Beverly Hills Polo Club. Prince Charles, right and Actress Stefanie Powers are among those to have frequented the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club since it was founded in 1982. Charles was the first member of the club . Bill Wyman, bass guitarist for The Rolling Stones at the club with a friend in 1987 . The ruling will be all the more frustrating for bosses at the Berkshire club, given that its rival isn't even a real polo club and openly admits to using the sport to create the perception of eliteness. The Berkshire club had applied to register its polo player logo on four classes of item including glasses, watches, jewellery and leather goods including travel bags, whips, harnesses and saddlery. But it was opposed by the Beverly Hills brand on the grounds that people could confuse the logo with their own and the case was eventually taken to the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. While it allowed the logo on whips, harnesses and saddlery, which discerning customers were unlikely to get confused, it ruled against the Berkshire club on applications for the other items. It said: 'It is true that the polo player is facing left and holding his mallet upright, while the earlier marks the polo player is facing right and holding his mallet ready to strike the ball. 'However, those slight differences are not sufficient enough to reduce significantly the similarity deriving from the fact that both the signs at issue display the figure of a polo player astride a galloping horse,' The Times reports. In 2006, the club was also blocked from using its logo on perfume and soap after a challenge from Ralph Lauren, famous for its Polo brand, also featuring a polo player, swinging a mallet. Too similar: Logo for the Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club . The Royal County of Berkshire Polo Club was founded in 1985 by music mogul Bryan Morrison, who made a fortune working with stars including Wham, Pink Ffloyd, Elton John and Robin Gibb from The Beegees. After Prince Charles became its first member, it quickly gained an international reputation and attracted stars from the music, fashion and film industries. It also became a favourite with the royals, with the late Major Ronald Furguson, father of Sarah, Duchess of York, being employed as the sponsorship manager. Founder Morrison died in 2008, having spent two years in a coma after being thrown from his pony at the club. His son, Jamie, is an England polo player and is now involved in the commercial side of the club.

But this Catholic hadn't read it -- at least, not from cover to cover. So, in the middle of Holy Week, I decided to finally take the plunge. Let me explain. My name is Laura Bernardini and I'm a director of coverage at CNN, which means I manage our newsgathering and newsroom in Washington. I'm also a lifelong Catholic. At work this week, I was talking with some colleagues about Pope Francis' upcoming trip to the United States.  During the course of that conversation, I admitted something that has privately bothered me for a long time. I have never read the Bible from Genesis to Revelation. This from someone who jokingly refers to herself as the highest-ranking Catholic in the bureau. My excuse always has been that Catholics have their Bible passages read to them at Mass every Sunday. And there are so many people that can so effortlessly quote long and beautiful passages. I love to read, there is no excuse. Still, it made me wonder: Why I had not read the Good Book cover to cover? I took a scriptures class in 9th grade of my Catholic high school, but we moved through that year with only selected passages to journal about. Later, when I graduated, my grandparents gave me a beautiful Bible that has traveled with me from Vermont to Montreal to Atlanta and finally to Washington. But in 24 years, I never so much as cracked the cover, other than to write the date I received the gift. In that newsroom conversation this week, Daniel Burke, the religion editor at CNN.com, suggested I read the Bible each day for a year and chronicle it weekly for Belief. I will admit to being pretty stunned and a little scared at the prospect. I figured that no one would care about my thoughts or my process. I am no scholar, no expert on scripture, as should be obvious. But the more we talked, the more the idea grew on me. I have committed to training regimens for 5Ks and countless diets, so why not try this? I have been looking for a form of meditation in my hectic life. This might just be it. My friends seem excited about this project, sending me some of their favorite passages, which I'm keeping a list of. One Catholic friend offered to join me, suggesting I get a blank journal to help me take notes. The colleague that I sit next to everyday has already sent me his Bar Mitzvah passage and wants to discuss it when I get there. Another friend's daughter is making her first Holy Communion in May, and  has also offered to connect us because her class is reading the Bible in school. So, in a way, I'm going back to first grade in Catholic school. Yay for me. Overall, my friends and family are mainly curious how this journey will end. I am, too. Will I make it all the way to Revelation come next spring? I start on Easter Sunday. I hope you'll join me.\n"]}

The Welshman has received some criticism from sections of the Bernabeu support despite a bright start in Madrid, and these remarkable stats will do nothing to help his popularity at the club. The \u00a386million man has missed out on just eight starts in Real Madrid's 50 matches this term, but his team-mates have picked up a 100 per cent win record when he has been away, scoring 25 and conceding just one goal. Gareth Bale has not started eight of Real Madrid's matches this season, through injury and omission . His latest injury, suffered against Malaga, meant he missed Wednesday night's Champions League game . Bale's time on the sidelines has coincided with huge matches against Barcelona, two Champions League ties with Liverpool (in which he entered the fray as a 62nd-minute substitute at the Bernabeu), and Wednesday night's European quarter-final against Atletico... but it seems the rest of the Real squad are just fine without him. In the first half of the season, Bale suffered a buttock muscle injury while on international duty with Wales, and he missed La Liga matches against Levante (5-0 win), Barcelona (3-1 win), Granada (4-0 win) and a 3-0 Champions League victory against Liverpool. He was in contention for the return leg against Liverpool at the Bernabeu, but did not start the match, instead coming on as a second-half substitute. Real were 1-0 up when he came on, and the score remained the same until the final whistle. In December, Madrid were already leading 4-1 against third-tier side Cornella in their Copa del Rey tie heading into the second leg, and Carlo Ancelotti opted to rest some of his biggest names. Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos, Sergio Ramos and Bale were all among the stars watching on from the sidelines as Los Blancos recorded a comfortable 5-0 win. That's six games without Bale in the starting line-up, and six wins for Real. Moving into 2015, Bale played a major role in the team's start to the year, scoring 12 goals between his return to the side against Celta Vigo and his omission against Eibar on April 11. Bale was sidelined for Real's 3-1 win over Barcelona, in which Cristiano Ronaldo scored a penalty . Karim Benzema scored in a 3-0 win against Liverpool at Anfield in October... Bale was injured for the game . Ancelotti stated in the build-up to the match that he had decided to rest the Welshman, while the team went on to win 3-0 against their struggling opposition. Bale again returned the side for two matches, a goalless draw against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League and a win against Malaga in La Liga, but suffered a calf injury in the early stages of the latter domestic clash. Instead of taking to the field in the crucial European match on Wednesday night, Bale was resigned to watching the match from home, where he tweeted his support of the team. Javier Hernandez's goal against Atletico ensured Real have won all of their eight matches without Bale . The Welshman took to Facebook on Wednesday to wish Real Madrid good luck against city rivals Atletico . Javier Hernandez's late goal ensured another victory for Ancelotti's men, taking their Bale-less record to eight wins, no draws and no losses. With the Welshman, Real have a 69 per cent win record, far from disastrous, recording 29 wins, four draws and nine losses. But the stats without him will surely give ammunition to those unhappy with their \u00a386million man.\n"]}

Goal: Soriano . De Jong was lucky to be on the pitch after a late and dangerous sliding tackle went unpunished in the first half before he finally made it into the referee's book for leading with his elbow, an action that could have seen him sent off. With European involvement pretty much a pipe dream now for Filippo Inzaghi's side, who sit eighth seven points behind fifth-placed Fiorentina, the best they can hope for is to ruin the hopes of their rivals. Sampdoria could have moved ahead of Napoli in fourth into the first of the two Europa League qualification spots but are instead sixth in the Serie A behind Fiorentina on goal difference. They are eight points shy of third-placed Roma in the last of the Champions League places. A large section of supporters continued their protests against the club's management with banners reading 'Vendesi', meaning 'for sale', along with signs with names of star players who have been sold, and a #SaveACMilan message.

Here Marco van Ginkel was dangerous from distance for Milan forcing Emiliano Viviano into action inside 15 minutes and was only just off target moments later. Destro, who left the field late in proceedings on a stretcher, headed a quality cross straight to Viviano on 30 minutes and did the same with a volley less than 10 minutes later. Alessio Cerci also squandered a chance from just outside the box over the crossbar. A different Sampdoria came out after the break and almost took the lead through Stefano Okaka and Eder, who was well saved by Diego Lopez at full stretch.

Fading champions City had to watch in frustration on Saturday, not only as Chelsea extended their lead at the top of the Barclays Premier League, but as Arsenal and Manchester United shunted them down to fourth. Slipping to such a position was not in the script when City pulled level with Chelsea on New Year's Day and any further slips would increase the pressure on Pellegrini significantly. Manuel Pellegrini has warned his side must overcome a difficult obstacle at Crystal Palace . Manchester City manager Pellegrini does not want his side to lose any more ground in the race for the title . With the Manchester derby coming next week, City can ill afford to drop points at Selhurst Park on Monday but Pellegrini knows the Eagles have become a tough proposition under Alan Pardew. Pellegrini said: 'Maybe they are playing different. They are in a good moment and they are playing with a lot of trust. 'With the other manager also Crystal Palace was a difficult team, but now they are playing at home.' City laboured to a 3-0 win over Palace at the Etihad Stadium in December in what proved Neil Warnock's penultimate match in charge. Pardew was appointed early in the new year and since then they have proved highly resilient, losing just three times in the Premier League and removing relegation fears. The Monday fixture has meant both sides have had to be patient for their return to action after the international break. It is a wait that could have been advantageous in terms of extra rest had their rivals lost over the weekend.

Pictured riding around on their mother's backs, or cuddling up in their arms, the duo have been welcomed by the other 17 gorillas in the enclosure, including Ernie, 32, who is father to them both. Scroll down for video . Helping hand: The babies were born to mothers Layla and Kumi on January 17 and 19, but keepers don't know either of their genders yet, and so they haven't been named . Baby steps: Two three-month-old Western Lowland Gorillas have been pictured for the first time at the Bronx Zoo since they were born less than 48 hours apart back in January . Despite being born back in January, keepers at Bronx Zoo have yet to learn either of the babies' genders, and so neither of them have been named yet. But that has not stopped them from winning over crowds at the zoo as they explore their new home. Because of their young age, they are not always on display for visitors, with appearances depending on conditions such as temperature and weather. The eldest of the pair was delivered on January 17 this year, while the younger arrived just 48 hours later, much to the excitement of animal keepers. While they weighed just 4lb at birth, they will eventually grow to weigh more than 400lb as adults. The new babies are joined by two other youngsters who were born earlier in 2014. Fitting in: The two new youngsters join another pair of gorillas that were born earlier in 2014, along with 13 adults in the zoo's\u00a0Congo Gorilla Forest exhibit . Having a cuddle: While the babies have different mothers, they share a father, 32-year-old Ernie who was nowhere to be seen in these pictures . The Western lowland gorilla is an endangered species in the wild, but while exact numbers are not known because of their remote habitats, they are believed to be more common than mountain gorillas. Lowland gorillas can be distinguished by their slightly brown coat and long arms, and usually live in communities of around 30. The group will be lead by one dominant male, the alpha, sometimes called the silverback because of the shock of silver hair which usually covers his shoulders. Thanks largely to disease and destruction of habitat, the numbers of Western Lowland gorillas living in the wild have dropped by 60 per cent in the last 20 to 25 years, making zoo conservation efforts all the more vital. Surviving: While the Western Lowlands Gorilla is thought to be among the most common gorillas in the wild, they are still an endangered species, making programs like this important to ensure their survival .\n"]}

And although the angle of the prints could suggest the lumbering reptiles were avid mountaineers, Bolivia\u2019s Cal Orcko paleontological site is the result of tectonic activity that forced the earth upwards. The attraction, at Fancesa limestone quarry in Sucre, comprises some 462 trails made up of 5,055 prints - and frequent landslides reveal new ones, some of which belong to  unknown species. Boliva\u2019s Cal Orcko paleontological site is the result of tectonic activity, forcing earth upwards and preserving the precious trackways so that dinosaur tracks are seen on a vertical 'wall' (pictured) The wall, which is the largest dinosaur trackway in the world, is approximately 390 feet (120 metres) tall and features tracks made by at least eight species of dinosaurs,The Daily Beast reported. Some of them are more than a metre in length, indicating the size of some of the vast beasts that roamed the area in the upper cretaceous period - a time in which the majority of dinosaurs lived. At first glance, it appears that large dinosaurs such as the Titanosaurs and armoured Ankylosauruses hauled their considerable bulks up the incredibly steep slope, which measures one mile (1.5km). But the imprinted rock was once horizontal before being pushed upwards by tectonic activity. The attraction, at Fancesa limestone quarry in Sucre, Bolivia (left), comprises some 462 trails made up of 5,055 prints (right) \u2013 and frequent landslides reveal new ones, some of which belong to unknown species . The wall, which is the largest dinosaur trackway in the world, is approximately 390 feet (120 metres) tall and features tracks made by at least eight species of dinosaurs. Some, like the one pictured, are large . In 2009, fossil hunters came across what are thought to be among the world's largest dinosaur prints. Measuring 5ft (1.5 metres) wide, they were made by long-necked sauropods 150 million years ago and were found in chalky sediment in the Jura plateau of eastern France. It's thought the Late Jurassic dinosaurs were more than 75 ft (23 metres) long and weighed up to 40 tonnes. Palaeontologist Jean-Michel Mazin of France\u2019s National Centre of Scientific Research, said at the time, from the prints, \u2018we can calculate their size and speed, find out about their behaviour and learn how they got around.' \u2018They were very hard to see because there were a lot of little stones (on the ground), there was grass growing there, and you really had to have a trained eye to notice something,\u2019 Dr Mazin said. The area was not mountainous when the dinosaurs were alive and the region had lots of water and islands, meaning the tracks were preserved by the sea and sediment. This activity thrust a huge slab of earth upwards, which dried into limestone and now resembles a cliff face. However, the site looked very different millions of years ago, when the region was muddy and flat. The dinosaurs left their mark while walking along the shoreline of a large lake. There are layers of prints preserved in the limestone because the marks hardened in dry periods, before being covered in preservative mud, enabling the process to start again. Paleontologist Klaus Schutt also suggested that a huge volcanic eruption threw millions of cubic metres of ash into space 68 million years ago, which gradually covered the prints to protect them, Unesco\u00a0reported. A decade after the discovery, which was made by miners in the mid 1980s, palaeontologists began to document the prints. Due to the spacing of these prints, experts can use them to reveal clues about the dinosaurs\u2019 gait, build and lifestyle. One set of tracks, for example, revealed two lines of prints with a smaller pair, suggesting a baby walked alongside its parents, while another set, now known as Johnny Walker, was made by a baby T.Rex. When some are removed, or crumble away, more are revealed underneath. While there may be more precious footprints yet to be found, some experts say Cal Orcko, which means \u2018lime hill\u2019 in the Quechua tongue, is under threat from human activity.

Two prototypes of the CYG-11 seaplane were tested this week over the sea off the coast of Haikou in Hainan Province in China. The aircraft is believed to be a joint project between Russia and China to build new types of super-efficient seaplane. The CYG-11 seaplane (above) uses reduced drag and increased lift from wing-in-ground effect to glide . The vehicles takes advantage of an aerodynamic phenomenon known as the wing-in-ground effect - where lift is increased and drag decreased when an aircraft's wings are close to the ground. Length: 13m . Wingspan: 15.6 m . Weight: 3800 kg . Seats: 12 people . Maximum load: 1200 kg . Maximum range: 1500 km . Flight speed: 175 - 250 km/h . Flight height: 3-5 m . Wave height: 1.25 - 3 m . By placing the wings low on the fuselage of the aircraft, this effect is increased and the the result is an aircraft that essentially floats on a cushion of air. Engineers behind the CNY 5 billion (\u00a3500 million) project say the aircraft are capable of flying 62 miles (100 km) on 28 litres of fuel. With a maximum range of 930 miles (1,500 km), the aircraft can reach a top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h). The aircraft races over the wavetops at a height of between three to five metres (9-15 feet). The CYG-11 aircraft, which have been developed by the Hainan Yingge Wing in Ground Effect Craft Manufacturing Company with Russian engineers, can carry 10 passengers plus two flight crew. The company claims to have just finished building a larger version of the aircraft capable of carrying 40 people, but it hopes to develop bigger aircraft capable of carrying between 55 and 120 passengers. The Hainan Yingge Wing in Ground Effect Craft Manufacturing Company tested two prototypes of the plane . The prototypes are designed to carry two pilots (above) and 10 passengers but larger craft are in development . The plane can be used like a catamaran initially until it builds up enough speed to lift off from the ocean . It says the aircraft could find uses for coastal defence, customs patrols and perhaps even be used as the public transport of the future along 'marine highways'. Gu Jianxin, a spokesman for the company, told the Southern Metropolis Daily: 'The current technology research and development has matured into mass production. 'The main plan is to invest in tourism, freight , maritime search and rescue and other aspects.' The CYG-11 (above) has been developed with Russian engineers and could be used to patrol coastlines . The aircraft (above) is designed to fly at low level between 3 m and 5 m above the surface of the ocean . Engineers say the aircraft (above) could even provide public transport of the future along 'marine highways' He estimates that it will cost around $20 million dollars for each vessel. Powered by two large propellers at the front of the aircraft, the CYG-11 can be driven in the sea much like a catamaran. Once it reaches flight speed the aircraft's wings will begin to lift it off the ocean and it will glide along on a cushion of air. Huang Dong, one of the pilots who flew the aircraft during the tests, said: 'It felt like when you ride a motorboat then the feeling is just as comfortable as sitting on a plane. There are no boat bumps.' The company are developing larger aircraft that they hope will be able to carry up to 120 passengers .\n"]}

David Cameron, addressing supporters in Somerset this afternoon, has warned voters that they have '11 days to save Britain', as he claimed Scottish nationalists 'don't want the country to succeed' The Prime Minister - taking a selfie with supporters today, said the Scottish National Party would prop up a minority Labour administration in the hope that the government would be a 'disaster' and bring forward its dream of independence . The warnings came as polls indicated that the General Election race was still neck and neck, with the UK heading for a hung parliament and coalition negotiations after May 7. A Survation poll put the Conservatives three points ahead on 33 per cent to Labour's 30 per cent. However, other polls had Labour nudging ahead. Today's Survation poll found that more than a third of English voters would not regard a Miliband administration propped up by the SNP as 'legitimate'. More than two-fifths - 44 per cent - meanwhile said that they would rather see England break away from Scotland than have an arrangement of this kind. Mr Cameron told the Sunday Express that an outright Conservative victory could make Britain 'one of the great international success stories of the next decade'. The Prime Minister echoed Tony Blair's 'education, education, education' slogan when he said his three top priorities would be 'economy, economy, economy'. But he warned: 'There are 11 days left to save the economy, to save jobs, effectively to save Britain.' A Survation poll has put the Conservatives three points ahead on 33 per cent to Labour's 30 per cent . Mr Cameron was interviewed on the Murnaghan programme, broadcast this morning, warning of the threat posed by the SNP .

'They don't want parliament to succeed. They don't want the government to succeed. They don't want the United Kingdom to succeed. That is really worrying.' Nicola Sturgeon and her predecessor Alex Salmond will want voters to look back after five years of a minority Labour adminstration made possible by the SNP and think 'that was a disaster, now can we break up the United Kingdom altogether?', said the Prime Minister. Mr Alexander was highly critical of the Conservatives' decision to focus their election campaign on the threat of Scottish nationalism. Ed Miliband, appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr show this morning, insisted Labour would not do any deals with the SNP . The Labour leader is under growing pressure to rule out governing with the support of SNP MPs .

When you stoke tensions, you are playing with fire.' Mr Alexander added: 'I think a majority Tory government would be a disaster for the whole of the United Kingdom because it would lurch this country to the right economically ... but it would be a particular disaster in Scotland, because it would give the SNP what they most want . - a grievance to nurse for the Scottish parliamentary election in 2016.'

'In times of scarcity, human nature is to do one's share if you think others are making similar sacrifices,' said Jonas Minton, a former senior state water official, now an adviser to the California-based Planning and Conservation League policy group. 'When it appears others are taking more than their share, it can be reduced to every person for themselves.' But farmers have already done their part, fallowing land and paying more for water, said Shawn Stevenson, a farmer in California's agricultural heartland, the Central Valley. Stevenson said he had to rip out nearly half his almond, pistachio and citrus trees. 'It's nice to know that some of our fellow state residents are going to share in the pain,' he said. 'Why they didn't do it last year, I don't know.' Californians should water enough to save their trees, water board head Felicia Marcus said, but should let their lawns go the way of all mortal things . Homeowners and water districts that violate the rules will be subject to fines, but many of the enforcement details have yet to be worked out .\n"]}
{"question_id": 161, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: The UK's top prosecutor today told critics deriding her decision not to prosecute Lord Janner over alleged child sex offences to challenge her in court. Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge because she is convinced the Labour peer is not fit to plead because of his dementia. And in her first interview since she announced Lord Janner would not face trial she refused to quit because 'making the right decision is not a resigning issue'. Fighting back:\u00a0Alison Saunders, the Director of Public Prosecutions, said she was 'not afraid' of a legal challenge over her decision not to charge Lord Janner and said she would not quit . Victims and leading politicians have accused her of 'damaging public confidence' in the justice system with her ruling \u2013 even though there was a enough evidence to go ahead with a prosecution. Mrs Saunders admitted herself that three investigations into claims made by 25 alleged victims over 25 years were botched \u00a0- but decided it was now too late to charge him. She told the\u00a0Evening Standard today: 'If somebody wants to challenge my decision I'm not afraid. The proper way to challenge it is through the right to review or a judicial review. 'I'm confident that if they want to do that my decision will stand up. I thought long and hard before making it and I'm confident I got it right. My job is not to be populist. 'The medical evidence was very clear. He wouldn't be fit to stand trial, he wouldn't understand the questions, he wouldn't understand the process, he wouldn't be able to understand instructions. 'It's not to make decisions on the basis of what people want. It's about making the right decisions. Sometimes that means it won't be popular but if I'm fulfilling my duties as DPP that's the right thing to do.' Police began investigating Lord Janner, pictured, after allegations of historic child-sex abuse were made but now he is too ill to be put on trial . Last night it emerged Mrs Saunders overruled the advice of two of the country's most senior barristers to allow Lord Janner to avoid a trial. Clare Montgomery QC and child abuse expert Eleanor Laws QC, leading counsel to the investigation, offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. In particular, Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and corroborating accounts by victims during the two-year police inquiry. But Mrs Saunders decided it was not in the public interest to put Lord Janner in the dock due to his Alzheimer's disease. Campaigners, MPs and victims believe a 'trial of the facts' could have satisfied the need to get to the bottom of the appalling claims against the peer, whatever his mental state. And MailOnline revealed last week that 19 dementia sufferers have been prosecuted for child sex offences and ten were in the past year. The Mail revealed today that Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32million home to his children at the height of the police paedophile case against him, it can be revealed. The move puts his luxury apartment potentially out of reach of child abuse victims suing the Labour peer for compensation. The flat, in an exclusive gated community near Hampstead Heath, North London, was transferred free of charge to his two daughters and son in March last year - the same month police raided Janner's Westminster office and three months after they had swooped on his home. In the four years after he was diagnosed with Alzheimer's in 2009, the former Labour MP, 86, has claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in parliamentary expenses and allowances. Lord Janner signed over the deeds of his \u00a32 million flat in this complex to his children after the police raid . Even earlier this month, on April 9, he was fit enough to sign a letter saying he wanted to remain in the House of Lords. A week later, the Crown Prosecution Service announced Janner would not be tried over child sex allegations because he was suffering so much from Alzheimer's that he could not even understand any charges against him, let alone answer them. This was despite the fact the CPS ruled there was enough evidence to charge him with 22 sexual offences against children dating from 1969 to 1988. Victims have accused bungling authorities of helping to cover up the crimes of a once powerful man and destroying any hope they had of justice. Child protection campaigners, MPs, police and victims have vowed to challenge the decision in the courts. Last night, two senior Government figures joined the chorus of disapproval and said concerns over the decision were justified. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there was something 'very strange' about the ruling and Health Minister Norman Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of dementia sufferers being brought to trial. He added that the matter should be brought before a court because Mrs Saunders and the Crown Prosecution Service had made 'heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so'. Last seen: Channel 4 News filmed Lord Jenner outside his house in London on July\u00a08 2014, when he was last seen in public . Signed: Dementia sufferer Lord Janner signed a letter on April 9, just a week after he was deemed unfit to stand trial. His signature has been redacted for privacy reasons . Mr Hunt said London Mayor Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been 'right' to express concern at the decision, adding: 'I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious.' Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and legal expert, said although there was strong evidence Lord Janner had dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. This week, leading politicians from seven parties demanded the decision be reversed. The group, led by Labour's Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times: 'As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.' A CPS spokesman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and that Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an 'ancillary matter'. At least ten men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010. Clare Montgomery QC, right and Eleanor Laws QC, left, both recommended Janner should face trial .\n"]}

Vietnamese Binh Wagner, 3, and her identical twin Phuoc were left with fatally impaired liver function due to Alagille syndrome. But when Phuoc needed a donor just a little more, their adopted father Michael chose her to receive his liver, which was a perfect match. Now, thanks to the generosity of an anonymous donor, Binh and her sister Phuoc are both on their road to recovery, reports the National Post. Scroll down for video . 'BINH RECEIVED HER GIFT!!!': A 3-year-old girl in Ontario recently received a donated liver after her sicker twin sister was chosen ahead of her to receive part of their adopted father's liver early this year . Binh and Phuoc Wagner of Kingston, Ontario were adopted by Michael and Johanne Wagner around a year and a half ago from Vietnam. The twins suffer from\u00a0Alagille syndrome, a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life . 'BINH RECEIVED HER GIFT!!! There are not enough words to thank the amazing and so unselfish donor,' the parents wrote on a Facebook page dedicated to the girls. The post continued: . 'Binh is recovering well, at her own pace. She has been through a lot with very different medical issues from her twin who had her transplant two months ago. 'We are looking forward to all being reunited and leading a healthier life now, with both transplants finally behind us.' When Mr Wagner and his wife Johanne found out that both girls would need a liver transplant, they were relieved to find out that he was a perfect match. However, Wagner was only able to give a portion of his liver to just one of his daughters, leaving him with an impossible choice. In the end, doctors suggested giving the donation to daughter Phuoc, since she needed it the most. Mr Wagner and daughter Phuoc went into surgery on February 10, and it has so far been a success. Anonymous lifesaver: The parents have asked that media not try to track down the donor of Binh's new liver, because he or she has chosen to remain anonymous . Recovering well: 'Binh is recovering well, at her own pace. She has been through a lot with very different medical issues from her twin who had her transplant two months ago,' read a Facebook update about the girl . Five days after the operation, the family posted a heartwarming video of the moment father and daughter were reunited in Phuoc's hospital room. 'Hey mon belle!' Mr Wagner says to his little girl, which translates to 'Hey my beauty' in French. The Wagners had seven of their own children before they decided to take Binh and Phouc in. Mrs Wagner said: 'When we saw them at the orphanage we were shocked, really. 'They were 9 pounds at 18 months. So we left the orphanage that day and went to buy two little containers with dragonflies on them and that's what we were going to lay their ashes in if they didn't make it.' Despite the health problems, Mrs Wagner does not regret her decision. She said: 'We look back and we have no regrets. 'We would travel this path all over again. They have taught us openness, they have taught our children sharing and openness. It's been nothing but a wonderful mess.' Months before Binh's transplant, Michael Wanger was convinced to pass her by and choose her sister Phuoc (right) to receive part of his liver . Alagille syndrome is a life-threatening genetic disorder that causes a loss of the bile ducts within the liver during the first year of life. This leads to a buildup of bile in the liver, causing damage to liver cells. Scarring may occur and lead to cirrhosis in about half of affected children. Symptoms including jaundice, loose stools and poor growth develop within the first three months of life. Later, there is persistent jaundice, itching, fatty deposits in the skin and stunted growth. The disease can stabilise between four and 10. It affects around one in 100,000 children. Children with the condition tend to have a prominent, broad forehead; deep-set eyes; a straight nose; and a small pointed chin. Treatment of Alagille syndrome focuses on trying to increase the flow of bile from the liver. Problems with fat digestion and absorption may lead to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). Deficiencies of these vitamins can be diagnosed by blood tests and can usually be corrected by large oral doses. Occasionally, liver cirrhosis advances to a stage where the liver fails to perform its functions. Liver transplantation is then considered. Alagille syndrome is generally inherited only from one parent and there is a 50 per cent chance that each child will develop the syndrome. Half of cases occur spontaneously.

After last summer\u2019s mammoth trek across the United States, an angry United manager Van Gaal vowed that it would never happen again on his watch and believes to this day that the effects of the pre-season schedule cost his side dearly when the real action started. Now Sportsmail can reveal that Van Gaal and United have turned down offers from Asia and Australia and are about to sign off a visit to America \u2013 in all likelihood to the west coast. The trip will last in the region of 12 days \u2013 a whole week shorter than last summer - and will be over by August 1. Manchester United beat Real Madrid in Michigan last summer in front of 109,000 fans . United played four games in America last pre-season, here Wayne Rooney scores against LA Galaxy . United beat Liverpool in the final to win the International Champions Cup last summer . While rivals such as Manchester City are trekking around Australia, Van Gaal and his United players will operate out of one base in America and travel to their games from there. The club have agreed once again to rake part in the International Champions Cup that they won last summer by beating Liverpool in a final in Miami. The tournament is played all over America but this time the promoters have essentially allowed United to choose their own venues as they are so desperate to have England\u2019s most famous club in it. Details of the competition were supposed to be announced last week with United given a provisional deadline to commit to their schedule by last Friday. However, the announcement has been put on hold while Van Gaal and United tweak final details. Last season, Van Gaal joined United after the World Cup in Brazil to find the club committed to a two-and-half week marathon comprising visits to Los Angeles, Pasadena, Denver, Washington, Detroit and, finally, Miami. Rooney scored another spectacular goal for United against Aston Villa last weekend . Following their tour of America, United suffered a slow start but are now firing on all cylinders in the league . The Dutch veteran was furious at the itinerary that he felt asked too much of his players as they were constantly asked to fly in to different time zones and even play at altitude in Colorado. Having to then play the final in Florida during a thunderstorm was the final straw. For long periods of this winter\u2019s negotiations, Van Gaal and United seemed set to commit to a schedule on America\u2019s East Coast. It is understand, however, that Van Gaal has recently performed a volte face and expressed a preference for the more agreeable climates of the west. Van Gaal has insisted this time that his team will travel to match venues from one base and will have no repeat of the arduous treks endured to games in Pasadena and Ann Arbor last year. One possible base is the Seattle Seahawks training camp on America\u2019s north-west coast. The Premier League season starts early this year, with the competition kicking off on August 8.\n"]}

The war of words started, Ms Bartholomew claims, when the man working at Sam the Butcher in Bondi called her a 'f***ing c***' when she asked for a different chicken to the one he had picked up. There were apparently more problems when she went to use her card to pay for the choice bird. 'His eftpos machine wasn't connecting so it was taking a while to process, and I felt really uncomfortable as he was clearly agitated, huffing and throwing things around,' she said.

Police Service of Northern Ireland said a number of shots were fired at the windows of the unoccupied house at 2.20am on Sunday. Detectives are now appealing for witnesses and said the incident had 'criminal elements'. Officers also said a red Honda Accord car, which is believed to have been involved in the incident, was found burnt-out in a nearby road shortly after the attack. Chief inspector Natalie Wilson said: 'This type of attack is totally unacceptable and there is no place for this type of activity in a civilised society. I know that the vast majority of people in Ballymena do not support those responsible. 'I want to reassure the Ballymena community that we are determined to tackle these criminal elements and as such we are committing additional resources over the next few nights. 'We will not accept this type of behaviour and I would ask for community support and information as we work to identify those responsible.' Police are appealing for witnesses to the incident which occurred when the house was unoccupied in the early hours of Easter Sunday. Investigators' markings showed at least 12 bullets hit one window of the house . Mr McBurney, who lives at the home on a quiet residental street in County Antrim with his brother Shane, 20, is deemed a bright prospect for Irish rugby and played in\u00a0Ireland U20's game vs France U20's (pictured above) One neighbour, who wished to remain anonymous, described the incident as 'very worrying'. He told Belfast Live: 'It is fortunate the boys were not at home when these shots were fired into the living room because with that amount of shots flying about we very well could be talking about the death of one or two brothers, one of whom is one of the best young rugby stars in Ireland.' Adam McBurney is deemed one of the best young rugby stars in Ireland and there are hopes he will play internationally. The young player grew up playing for his local club Ballymena, and has also been associated with Randalstown RFC. He has since gone on to represent Ulster and Ireland and has been capped for the Ireland Under-20s \u2013 playing recently against Italy and France in their Six Nations campaign. He is also actively involved with the Belfast Met Rugby Academy- which blends intense professional rugby training with academic courses. Alongside rugby, McBurney works at Tullyglass House Hotel - an imposing country residence set in its own grounds on the outskirts of Ballymena. Another neighbour, Marie McKeown, 77, added: 'I heard the bangs and at first I didn't realise what it was. It woke me up. 'This is a very quiet area. I would be a light sleeper and I heard bang, bang, bang. I was shocked when I heard this happening. I hope it quietens down.' Following the attack, police cordoned off part of the housing estate and increased patrols in the area. It is believed, from the bullet casings found at the scene, that a nine-mm type weapon was fired with twelve rounds hitting the living room window and its frame. A further two strike marks were visible on the wall above the window. Bullets lodged in the kitchen and in the bathroom walls suggest that anyone who might have been in either room at the time of the shooting would most likely have been killed or suffered serious injury. Mr McBurney, who played for his local rugby club Ballymena before going on to represent Ulster and Ireland, inherited the property with his brother when their mother Heather died in December 2013. Anyone with information about the incident should contact police on 101 or Crimestoppers anonymously on 0800 555 111.\n"]}

Frightened passengers held their heads and prayed as Flight 5622, operating as a United Express, dropped nearly 30,000 feet in eight minutes and made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York. The situation arose about an hour after take-off, when three passengers on the Embraer 175 twin-jet from Chicago to Connecticut  lost consciousness and others began feeling dizzy and sick. When the plane landed, SkyWest initially claimed that the aircraft landed 'out of an abundance of caution' because of one sick passenger and denied there was any mechanical malfunction - which conflicted with reports from people on the plane. Late on Wednesday, the airline said new information from medical personnel confirmed that 'a total of three passengers reported a loss of consciousness while on the flight'. Scroll down for video . Emergency responders came onboard SkyWest Flight 5622 after it made an emergency landing in Buffalo, New York, on Wednesday following a reported loss of cabin pressure . Mary Cunningham, a nurse, who was on board the flight assisted one passenger who passed out, getting her oxygen. She said that the plane did not land because of just one person's medical emergency as a lot of people on board began to feel dizzy and unwell . Passenger Frank Angelo said he immediately feared for the safety of his wife and kids as the plane 'nosedived' 30,000 feet in just eight minutes . 'You could feel something in the air, something just wasn't right,' recalled one passenger before the plane plunged miles in mere minutes. Passenger Larry Johnson, right, said: 'A lot of people with their heads down praying. It just felt like a re-enactment' Emergency nurse, Mary Cunningham, said she helped treat an unconscious passenger when another passed out beside her and others nearby started feeling faint. 'The flight attendant and myself started not feeling very well while we were in the middle of the flight helping out. I had to sit down. I was short-of-breath, light-headed [and] didn't feel great,' said Cunningham to NBC Connecticut. Initially, reports came in that a cabin door had opened during the flight, leading to dramatic loss in cabin pressure. When the plane landed at 11.40am, the FAA issued a statement saying the crew 'reported a pressurization problem and declared an emergency', shortly before landing in Buffalo. However, in a second statement the FAA put out on Wednesday afternoon, there was no mention of a 'pressurization' issue. When contacted by the LA Times to explain this, a spokesperson for the FAA would not say why the change was made. However, an official with knowledge of the incident told the LA Times that crew members did report that a door had come open at 38,000 feet and was causing 'rapid depressurization.' On landing this was declared untrue and SkyWest airlines said they were examining what happened on the aircraft midflight. SkyWest spokeswoman Marissa Snow said: 'There were no reports before the unconscious passenger prior to the initiated descent, but I can't speak to what may have been the specific cause of their feeling ill.' SkyWest added that there was no indication of any problems with the doors and that its mechanics were inspecting the aircraft. Nose dive: Emergency vehicles surround a SkyWest Airlines plane, operating as United Express, that made an emergency landing at Buffalo Niagara International Airport on Wednesday . Flight 5622, from Chicago to Hartford, made an emergency landing in Buffalo . Passenger, Dave Barkley, 46, told the LA Times that he was sat near the front of the aircraft and he saw a flight attendant race to the cockpit and tell the pilot passengers were falling unconscious. Suddenly, the pilot announced the plane was going to begin an emergency landing over Detroit. 'They said there was a pressure problem with the plane,' he said. 'There was no door flying open or anything like that. It was something very gradual.' Barkley said that while the passengers were calm, he was annoyed about with public statements the airline has made. 'The way SkyWest is reporting it is that someone got sick, and they had to land,' he told the LA Times. 'But the way we understand it, they got sick because of the lack of oxygen or lack of pressure in the plane.' A nurse flying on the Embraer 175 twin-jet described a growing sense of panic and hysteria as she herself began to feel ill while treating two women who had passed out. It was at that moment the pilot took decisive action and put the plane into a steep dive rather than take any risks. 'The passenger was lethargic. She was responding but her color was off. She didn't look good. We got her some oxygen. She was much more alert after getting the oxygen,' the nurse, Mary Cunningham, tells NBC Connecticut. Cunningham says she returned to her seat once the woman felt better. It was then when she says the woman sitting behind the first passed out, as well. Then Cunningham, herself, took a turn.

While another passenger said, 'you could just feel something in the air, something just wasn't quite right.' For nearly eight minutes, the plane descended at a very steep incline, dropping as fast as 7,000 feet per minute, while flying over Lake Erie, flight tracking service FlightAware said. The flight originated in Chicago and had been bound for Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Connecticut. It landed at Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Buffalo at about 11:40 a.m. SkyWest Inc., which is based in St. George, Utah, said the jet landed safely and a passenger received medical attention before being released. An additional 15 adults and two children were evaluated upon landing, but none required treatment outside the airport, airport spokesman C. Douglas Hartmayer said. 'Anyone who said they didn't feel well was treated at the gate,' he said. 'We want to understand the circumstances and what SkyWest knows before we decide what, if any, action we would take,' said Kelly Nantel, spokeswoman for the National Transportation Safety Board. Snow said the plane's oxygen masks did not release. According to WKBW, one passenger said the plane 'nosedived' and crew told fliers that\u00a0there was a loss of cabin pressure, but that turned out not to be true. SkyWest has 29 Embraer 175s in its fleet. The aircraft seats 76 passengers with two flight attendants.

But girlfriend Anneli Tiirik, 23, said she did not blame Lubitz, 27, who had hidden a sick note on the day of the crash and was found to have researched suicide methods in the days leading up to it. Couple: Anneli Tiirik (right) said she did not blame the co-pilot for the death of her boyfriend Paul Bramley (left) Killer co-pilot: Andreas Lubitz locked the captain out of the cockpit before flying the plane into a mountainside . She told the Sunday People: \u2018I cannot hate or blame someone for being sick. Instead of blaming sick people and trying to understand their motives from the perspective of a health mind, we should concentrate on changing the system that enables such people to be in positions of power.\u2019 The music student - who began dating Mr Bramley four years ago - said she hoped airlines would bring in greater checks, such as brain scans, to prevent similar disasters in future. She said she had waited for Mr Bramley at Manchester Airport, having flown in herself from Estonia, before later learning of the crash. \u2018He was originally meant to land in Manchester on the Monday night, but he changed his flight at the last moment for Tuesday.

He had just finished his first year at the college and was flying home via Dusseldorf from a few days holiday with friends in Barcelona when he was killed. The other Britons killed were Martyn Matthews, 50, from Wolverhampton, and seven-month-old Julian Pracz-Bandres, from Manchester, who died alongside his mother, Marina Bandres Lopez Belio, 37, originally from Spain. Many UK airlines changed their rules in the wake of the crash to ensure two people were in the cockpit at all times. The Mail on Sunday reported last month how Mr Bramley\u2019s father made an emotional appeal for the 150 dead not to be forgotten and demanded airlines be more \u2018transparent\u2019. Fighting back tears in Digne, close to where his son perished on March 24, Philip Bramley said: \u2018What is relevant is that it should never happen again; my son and everyone on that plane should not be forgotten, ever.

Joseph Oberhansley, from Jeffersonville, Indiana, is charged with murder and abuse of a corpse in the death of 46-year-old Tammy Jo Harbin Blanton last September. On Tuesday, Clark County Prosecutor Jeremy Mull asked for rape to be added to those charges and a judge will consider the request on May 4, the\u00a0Courier-Journal\u00a0of Louisville reported. The motion to change the charges comes after lab results for the victim's body were returned. 'Cannibal killer':\u00a0Joseph Oberhansley, who admitted to killing his ex-girlfriend before eating some of her organs last year, could now face a rape charge. Prosecutors say they will recommend the death penalty . Murdered:\u00a0Tammy Jo Blanton, right, had called police asking for help just hours before she was found dead . Last year, prosecutors said they intended to seek the death penalty in the case. Juries in Indiana cannot recommend a death sentence or life without parole unless they agree there is at least one aggravating circumstance beyond a reasonable doubt, the law says. Rape, burglary and dismemberment are among those aggravated circumstances. Oberhansley, now 34, was convicted of manslaughter in the 1998 shooting death of his then-girlfriend, 17-year-old Sabrina Elder, in Salt Lake City just days after the birth of their son. He served 14 years behind bars for the crime and was discharged from parole on July 23 last year.

Then on September 11, she called 911 at around 3am to report that her jilted boyfriend was outside her home and would not leave, according to the probable cause affidavit. Officers arrived on the scene and ordered Oberhansley to leave after Blanton spoke to him outside. At around 10am that morning, police got another call, this time from Blanton's co-worker, asking them to perform a welfare check after she failed to show up for work. Police found that the back door had been forced open and inside, officers discovered Blanton dead under a tarpaulin in the blood-spattered bathroom of her home, with fatal injuries to her head, neck and torso. 'The front of the victim's skull appeared to have been crushed and brain tissue appeared scattered around the bathtub,' the affidavit stated. The statement added that they found a plate covered in blood and bone, as well as bloodied cooking utensils, the Louisville Courier-Journal reported. Scene:\u00a0Oberhansley allegedly broke down Blanton's backdoor at her Jeffersonville home, pictured, and then forced his way into her bathroom, where she was hiding, and repeatedly stabbed her . When questioned by police, Oberhansley confessed to forcing his way into the bathroom, where Blanton had locked herself, and repeatedly stabbing her. Oberhansley told police he then used an electric jigsaw to open Blanton's skull and ate parts of her brain, heart and lungs. The blade was allegedly recovered from the scene after the grisly death.

Now fascinating images reveal how fish make a collective effort to stay out of the way of sharks. The striking photographs show a shoal of fish making way for the blacktip shark swimming in the shallow waters of Heron Island in Queensland, Australia. Incredible images show a shoal of fish making way for a blacktip shark (pictured), perhaps proving that they are instinctively frightened of it . It is thought that the reef shark was not interested in catching a meal, but the fish naturally keep their distance, creating circles of clear water around the predator. Dr Ken Collins, Senior Research Fellow and Diving Officer at the University of Southampton, told MailOnline: 'This is fairly typical behaviour for shoaling fish, the same would happen if it were a diver in the photograph rather than a shark. 'Something big is automatically accepted as a potential threat and swimming in a swirling dense shoal is a defensive move which provides mutual protection simply reducing the chances of an individual being picked off and confusing the potential \u201cenemy\". 'Flocks of small birds will react the same way to hawks.' Fish are thought to gain many benefits from shoaling behaviour, such as keeping safe from predators as well as boosting their chances of feeding and finding a mate. It\u2019s known that shoals of fish can change shapes and directions in seconds - as if they are thinking as one - and in these images, the fish manage to keep a pocket of clear water between themselves and the shark, even the pocket does change shape. Software engineer Scott Carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the shark. The photos show a shark swimming in the shallow waters, where they are guaranteed a clear path because \u2018terrified\u2019 fish move out of their way . Software engineer Scott Carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across fish trying to avoid the shark off Heron Island in Queensland, Australia (marked) It\u2019s thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators\u2019 jaws, because they confuse larger creatures. The \u2018predator confusion effect\u2019 is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because similar-looking fish create a sensory overload for predators. Fin movements made by a shoal seem to overlap to mimic waves created by a larger animal, perhaps to dissuade a predator from attacking. The fact that there are many fish in a shoal means they have many eyes to scan an area for predators and keep out of the way. The look-out is shared between individuals to let the group feed safely and swim away from predators as a group. Luckily, the 32-year-old was carrying his camera to snap the scene. \u2018There were four blacktip reef sharks circling the area and there was one other type of shark - a lemon shark,\u2019 he said. \u2018We walked along the jetty looking down at a large school of fish just beneath the jetty. \u2018We noticed a number of reef sharks patrolling the area near the jetty and as we watched the reef sharks slowly moved into the school of fish, with the fish retreating away from the immediate area around the shark. \u2018This progressed for about 15 to 20 minutes and a lemon shark joined in on the action late in the piece. \u2018It seems like the fish are well aware of the threat and are trying to keep a safer distance from it. They want to avoid being eaten!\u2019 He noted that the sharks were \u2018remarkably calm\u2019 when moving though the fish. \u2018It was certainly not what I would describe as a feeding frenzy at the time. \u2018There was an occasional swift manoeuvre to attempt to catch a fish and the sharks were successful in some of these attempts. He added: \u2018Watching the continuous parting of the school of fish as each shark moved through the mass of fish was absolutely spectacular!\u2019 Whether fish feel fear (illustrated by a still from the film Finding Nemo' is a slippery question for scientists. Some studies claim that fish feel pain, but shoaling behaviour's thought to be purely instinctive . Software engineer Scott Carr was looking for a picturesque spot to have photos taken before his wedding when he came across the shoal of fish trying to avoid the sharks (pictured left and right) near a jetty . Whether fish have emotions, is a slippery question for scientists, whose studies have shown that they can feel pain in an abstract way, as well as other emotions. Whether fish feel fear, or simply act instinctively, they swim in large shoals that offer individuals more protection from predators than going it alone. Shifts in the shape of the shoal is thought to be driven by feeding, travelling and avoiding predators. It\u2019s thought that shoals may be an effective means for the majority of fish within them to escape predators\u2019 jaws, because they confuse larger creatures. Proposed in 1978, the \u2018predator confusion effect\u2019 is based on the idea that it becomes difficult for predators to pick out individual prey from groups because the many moving targets create a sensory overload of the predator's visual channel \u2013 a theory that\u2019s been proved in the wild and in computer simulations. There is also a theory that fin movements made by a shoal overlap to mimic waves created by a larger animal, perhaps to dissuade a predator from attacking. It\u2019s possible that if one shark was found among the shoal (pictured) and others around it, they could act collectively to corral a shoal for a quick meal. The fact that there are many fish in a shoal means they have many eyes to scan an area for predators and keep out of the way. The look-out is shared between individuals to let the group feed safely and swim away from predators as a group. It\u2019s possible that if one shark was found among the shoal and others around it, they could act collectively to corral a shoal. This behaviour isn\u2019t common in sharks, but dolphins have been shown to surround and herd fish as a group, while individuals take it in turns to swim through the shoal, eating unlucky members. Corralling is a method where fish are chased to shallow water where they are more easily captured and Atlantic bottlenose dolphins even chase fish onto mud banks for an easy meal. In the shark world, Thresher sharks use their long tails to stun shoaling fish. Before striking they confine lots of fish in a small space by swimming round them, and then splash then strike them with the upper lobe of the tail to stun them.\n"]}

Offensive: University of Kentucky guard Andrew Harrison found himself in hot water last night when he directed a racial slur at a University of Wisconsin player, at a press conference following the Wildcats 71-64 loss . Everyone heard: When another player at the press conference as asked about Badgers player Frank Kaminsky (right), Harrison (left) covered his mouth and said 'f*** that n****' - but his microphone still projected the comment. Kaminsky and Harrison pictured above at Saturday night's semi-final game in Indianapolis, Indiana . The sophomore's comment came as a reporter asked Kentucky's Karl-Anthony Towns about defending the 7-foot Kaminsky. He muttered it with his hand in front of his mouth, but the mic picked up the comments. Social media immediately lit up with tweets about what Harrison said along with video clips, and the program looked into the matter. Harrison said in a series of comments on Twitter that he wanted to apologize 'for my poor choice of words used in jest towards a player I respect and know.' 'When I realized how this could be perceived I immediately called big frank to apologize and let him know I didn't mean any disrespect,' he added. He said the two of them had a 'good conversation' and he wished him good luck in Monday's championship game. Harrison had 13 points and four assists in the loss. Harrison and his twin brother, Aaron, have been projected as NBA draft picks but didn't discuss their futures after the loss.

{"question_id": 178, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Jacob Lawrence's groundbreaking work, \"The Migration of the Negro,\" is a series of 60 small paintings with text depicting the lives of millions of pre-World War II blacks as they moved from the oppressive South to the promise of a better life in the North. One frame in particular, No. 22, shows three black men dressed in their Sunday best, handcuffed, heads bowed standing in front of a window adorned with prison bars. The caption reads: . \"Another of the social causes of the migrants' leaving was that at times they did not feel safe, or it was not the best thing to be found on the streets late at night. They were arrested on the slightest provocation.\" Lawrence painted this picture around 1940. This is important to know because there are some people who blame President Barack Obama for racial tension in America as if the March on Washington scrubbed away the lasting effects of 300 years of inequality. No. 22 was painted before hip-hop became the pi\u00f1ata for conservative talk show hosts to bash and before sagging pants became a popular fashion statement. Some of us keep looking for a new reason why this old problem continues to haunt us because to think otherwise requires effort. It's a lot easier to retweet a Dr. King meme. It is more convenient to say the violence began when rioters threw bricks at police and not when a city's Police Department began terrorizing its residents. We criticize Baltimore's mayor for not \"restoring order\" as if paying victims of police brutality nearly $6 million in a four-year span is \"order.\" Now, some people are partially blaming the 2013 movie \"The Purge\" for the uprising in Baltimore as if the 1996 riots in St. Petersburg, Florida, happened on a different planet. Or that the more than 100 cases of Baltimore police brutality that were either lost or settled out of court since 2011 provide no insight as to what the residents have been dealing with for some time. An 87-year-old grandmother had her shoulder broken by overzealous police, and Sen. Rand Paul -- God bless him -- suggested the rise in absentee fathers is the reason for this latest clash. It is true only 34% of black children live in a two-family household today, and I do believe that is a problem. Soul searching, as the President suggested, is something that needs to be had by all. But it is also true that 65% of black children lived with both parents in 1960, and yet there was still a lack of trust between the police and the minority community. Sen. Paul's rationale falls apart when you consider that John Henry Crawford III was shot and killed by police at a Walmart in Ohio while on the phone talking with the mother of his two children. Crawford's father was literally playing with his two grandchildren as his son was being gunned down. In 1971, Marvin Gaye cracked the Top 10 on the pop charts with \"Inner City Blues,\" which included the lines: . Crime is increasing . Trigger happy policing . Panic is spreading . God knows where we're heading . And yet so many look at the protests, uprisings and yes, sometimes riots, with this incredulous demeanor as if the raw emotions captured on camera are materializing out of thin air. No backdrop. No historical context. Television journalists asking questions that seem to characterize the recent developments as unexplained anger detached from any tangible issue. It is as if they believe the absence of burning crosses translated into peace and harmony. Meanwhile, Louisiana state police want people to believe Victor White III shot himself in the chest while handcuffed sitting in the back of a police car. How can there be peace when the Department of Justice found black residents in Ferguson were preyed upon for years by a corrupt Police Department? Where is the harmony when the average white household has 13 times the wealth of its black counterpart? And we know the impact wealth has on education, housing and mortality. Now there is video of police in Inkster, Michigan, celebrating the beating of a suspect as he sits nearby with broken ribs, a head injury and bleeding. The officers fist pump and laugh. One of them even appears to joyfully re-enact parts of the incident in plain view of Floyd Dent, the man in custody. And when the incident in question was under investigation, the Inkster Police Department suppressed the video. Two months would go by before the public saw what we are paying for. But at least we saw it. In Chicago, the police department has yet to release dash cam video of the fatal encounter officers had with 17-year-old Laquan McDonald last October. The report said an officer fired shots into McDonald's chest after the teen lunged at them with a knife. Witnesses said the shooting was unjustified. The autopsy shows McDonald was shot 16 times from a variety of angles by the officer. The City Council recently approved a $5 million settlement but maintains there was no wrongdoing. The video could shed some light on what really happened...which may explain why we have yet to see it. This comes on the heels of Mayor Rahm Emanuel establishing a $5.5 million reparations fund for victims of former CPD commander John Burge. For three decades Burge and his team ran a torture ring that used electric shock, burned and beat up more than 100 black men. And some look at Baltimore and the protests happening all around the country and wonder where all of this rage is coming from? This mistrust didn't come from somewhere. It's always been here. Woven in the comedic deliveries of Richard Pryor, Dick Gregory and Dave Chappelle; saturated within the prose of Lorraine Hansberry, Maya Angelou and Shonda Rhimes; heard in soulful cries of Billie Holiday's \"Strange Fruit\" to John Legend standing on an Oscar stage singing \"one day, when the glory comes it will be ours.\" For decades, the works of black artists have explicitly talked about the Baltimores of this country and though their work has been celebrated and curated, the message remains lost. Why else would someone believe sagging pants and hoodies are to blame for mass incarcerations? That President Obama is the reason why some blacks are frustrated with police and not the dynamic beautifully captured by Lawrence 75 years ago. Before President Richard Nixon started the war on drugs. Before Eric Garner started selling loose cigarettes in Staten Island. Before Baltimore became the setting of a critically acclaimed TV show. There isn't a new reason why Freddie Gray's death triggered outrage. Just new ways for people to validate apathy and explain away racism.\n"]}

He asks Siri in Russian 'Is gay marriage normal?' and gets the response: 'I believe this emotion should be considered negative.' To the question 'How do you register a gay marriage in England?' Siri replies 'So, now you're swearing obscenities and you're going to eat with these very hands!' The same query also gets the response 'I will pretend I didn't hear that', while the Apple user is told 'Alex, you are so rude!' in reply to the question 'Siri, tell me about gay marriage'. He also asks 'Siri, gay clubs around me?' and is told 'I would have turned red if I could'. Alex says at the end of the nearly two minute clip: 'This is happening in London.

The company has said the responses to Alex's questions were down to a 'bug' which it has now fixed . Gay rights are a delicate topic in Russia since a law banning 'gay propaganda' was passed in 2013, effectively prohibiting the showing of \u2018non-traditional\u2019 or homosexual relationships in any form to people under the age of 18. Apple CEO Tim Cook came out as gay last October. He has since condemned discrimination on a number of occasions, speaking out against anti-gay laws in a number of US states. Last November, a tribute to Steve Jobs was removed from a college campus in St Petersburg after Mr Cook's announcement. When the English version of Siri launched there were complaints about some of its responses, which included refusing to look up the locations of local abortion clinics.

Kestutis Martuzevicius repeatedly stalled efforts to extradite him, claiming they breached his human rights. The 52-year-old, who is wanted for 22 crimes in Lithuania, spun out the legal battle for nearly five years by insisting he was mentally ill, leaving the British public to foot the bill. Depression claim: In January last year, Kestutis Martuzevicius was admitted to Broadmoor on health grounds but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh Prison (above) Yesterday judges at the European Court of Human Rights criticised his \u2018manifestly ill-founded\u2019 case and ruled the alleged killer should be put on a plane home. In Lithuania he is accused of 22 crimes including two murders, robbery and extortion between 1993 and 1997, when he was a member of the feared Daktarai gang. The ruling brought to an end a saga that began when a warrant for his arrest was issued by Lithuanian police in June 2010. His case has cost British taxpayers a six-figure sum, according to legal experts. This figure includes the cost of police time, legal fees racked up by challenging his claims in the courts, the \u00a340,000 a year price of keeping him in the Category A prison Belmarsh, and treating him at Broadmoor high-security psychiatric hospital. His case reignited the row over the ease with which alleged foreign criminals could exploit human rights laws. Michael Ellis, a former Tory MP, said: \u2018This is a shocking example of Labour\u2019s Human Rights Act putting the rights of suspected foreign criminals ahead of the rights of the British public.\u2019 Waste of time: Judge Guido Raimondi (above), of the European Court of Human Rights, said: 'The court considers that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected' Martuzevicius came to the UK in 1996. It is thought he claimed asylum. He was arrested in London in June 2011 under a European Arrest Warrant. Magistrates agreed to his extradition in October of that year and he was held in Belmarsh prior to being sent home. But he appealed to the High Court on the grounds he was depressed and would face reprisals by criminals in his homeland if he returned. He claimed this violated Article 2, the right to life, and Article 3, the right to avoid inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. British judges ruled his extradition would not be unjust because he could expect a fair trial and the authorities would protect him from retaliation. But Martuzevicius then launched a new appeal with the European Court of Human Rights. According to court documents, in 2012 he was diagnosed as mentally ill, with a psychiatric report saying he was seriously depressed, suffering from a delusional disorder, and that there was a risk of suicide. In January last year, he was admitted to Broadmoor but by June his condition had improved and he was returned to Belmarsh. He appealed to Strasbourg under Article 3 and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to a fair trial, because he had not been allowed to argue his ill-health during extradition proceedings. But in a written ruling, the European judges, led by court president Guido Raimondi, said Martuzevicius\u2019s claim that extradition breached his human rights was \u2018inadmissible\u2019. They added: \u2018The court considers this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected.\u2019\n"]}

Atletico Madrid supporters have stopped fretting about departures because they have good reason to be confident in the people that run the club and their ability to find adequate replacements. In goal Sergio Asenjo became David De Gea, became Thibaut Courtois, who looks to have become Jan Oblak. Playmaker Diego Ribas became Arda Turan. While centre-forward Diego Forlan became Sergio Aguero, became Radamel Falcao, became Diego Costa who has now become that bloodied battering-ram Mario Mandzukic. Atletico Madrid know how to replace stars, from David De Gea (left to right), to Thibaut Courtois, to\u00a0Jan Oblak . Sergio Aguero (left) was a star at Atletico before being replaced by Radamel Falcao at the Spanish club . Diego Costa (left, squaring up to John Terry) was sold to Chelsea but replaced by Mario Mandzukic (right) Atletico manager Diego Simeone has been pulling the strings at the La Liga club in terms of transfers . The secret of their success is often exactly that \u2013 a secret. No club has used the third-party ownership lenience in Spain more to its advantage than Atletico Madrid. Transfers like Radamel Falcao were always shrouded in mystery. How were they able to sell Aguero to Manchester City and hand over a large portion of the fee to the tax man to service their monumental overdraft with the state, and yet still go into the transfer market and get Falcao for an even higher price than Aguero? Jorge Mendes has worked closely with the club and with its managing director Miguel angel Gil Marin across the last five years and there is no question the club have benefited from a healthy relationship with the world\u2019s most prolific agent. It was bordering on comical in 2010 when the Globe Soccer Awards in Dubai picked Gil as its sports director of the year. Mendes played a large part in the setting up of the annual awards \u2013 he himself has won agent of the year every year since its inauguration. Atletico playmaker Diego Ribas became Arda Turan at the Vicente Calderon under Simeone . Falcao (right), formerly of Atletico, sits with super-agent Jorge Mendes (left) during a match in France . Atletico's CEO Miguel Angel Gil Marin (far right) give a press conference in Madrid in 2009 . His domination of the best agent award was easier to justify than Gil\u2019s prize that year, coming as it did when Atletico were still hugely indebted to Spain\u2019s Inland Revenue and forced to fire sell every summer. But Gil has led Atletico out of trouble. He has picked his agent friends well, worked the loophole in the system \u2013 one Fifa want to close allowing third party ownership in Spain when it is banned in other leagues - and that has played a part in the club's rise. Mendes it was who discovered Costa and brought him to Atletico Madrid via Portugal. The super-agent can also claim to have been the man who saw the huge potential in the unrefined Brazilian front man, overruling scouts that he usually trusted without question and signing the youngster from Lagarto thus beginning the process of making him one of Europe\u2019s top striker. He was loaned him out to four La Liga clubs but was always brought back to Atletico who would eventually win the Spanish Cup, the European Super Cup and the League with him as their centre-forward. Koke is Atletico's brightest homegrown talent and he lined up in midfield on Tuesday night . Mario Suarez and Gabi try to stop Cristiano Ronaldo during the Madrid derby in the Champions League . As well as using the right agents to get the right players Atletico have \u2013 like so many teams in Spain benefitted from an extensive and well-run youth system. Koke is their brightest homegrown talent and he lined up in midfield on Tuesday against Real Madrid with Mario Suarez and Gabi who also both came through the ranks at Atletico albeit only arriving at the first team after long spells away from the club. Next season Oliver Torres should return from a hugely successful spell at Porto and line up alongside another off the conveyor build: the hugely impressive Saul Niguez. It also shouldn\u2019t be forgotten that with a very similar squad back in 2012 Atletico Madrid were closer to the relegation places than the European places and even their most blinkered fan would have dismissed out of hand the idea that they would ever be winning the league and playing the Champions League final in the same season any time soon. The reason for the change is perhaps their greatest signing of all \u2013 Diego Simeone. He arrived at the start of 2012 just after they had been knocked out of Copa del Rey by a third division side. The likes of former Osasuna winger Juanfran were in the team back then too \u2013 he looked a symbol of the oh-so average signings being made by the club at the time. Simeone has been up there with their greatest signings when they made him manager previously . Juanfran was converted by Simeone to full-back and is now in the form of his life at Atletico . Juanfran was converted by Simeone to full-back and is now first choice on the right hand side of Spain\u2019s defence. His transformation is still a symbol, only now it is one of just how much the club and team have progressed. Chinese company Wanda now owns 20 per cent of Atletico Madrid, their tax debt is under control and they are in a position to sign players without having to sell. Having bought so well when they were in a worse financial situation, supporters are optimistic \u2013 just as long as they don\u2019t lose Simeone: the real alchemist at Atletico Madrid.\n"]}

She figured White House chief of staff Denis McDonough hadn't heard she's expecting a baby girl in July. 'My immediate instinct in my head was to tell him I'm pregnant and this will be the end of this. He'll tell me good luck and be very kind about it and I'll be on my merry way,' said Psaki, who was serving as chief spokeswoman at the State Department. Instead McDonough - and later Obama himself - assured Psaki they would accommodate her needs as a new mom amid the West Wing's nonstop demands. She started in the post Wednesday and is one of two pregnant women serving as assistant to the president \u2014 a first for such a top level adviser in Obama's presidency and practically unheard of under previous presidents. A family-friendly administration: Obama aides Katie Fallon (left) and Jen Psaki (right) are expecting babies in May and July of this year. High-ranking female administration officials becoming pregnant \u00a0is virtually unheard of . What to expect when your expecting...in the White House: Psaki (left) says the White House knew she was pregnant when she was being considered for the communications director job, and that Mr Obama called her personally and assured her that maternity leave would not be an issue . Caring: Fallon (left) says the president is constantly checking up on her health, making sure she's attending her doctor's appointments. She is currently serving as the president's legislative director . Rahm Emanuel, Obama's first chief of staff and now Chicago mayor, once remarked that every White House says they'll be family-friendly, but it's never really a good workplace for any family except the president's. Yet Obama has pushed family-friendly policies like childcare, flexibility and paid leave, including instituting 12 weeks paid maternity leave for his own staff. But until now, he hasn't put it into practice in a very prominent way with few mothers of young children on his own senior team. 'All workplaces are adapting and that includes the White House,' said Obama legislative director Katie Beirne Fallon. She is scheduled to give birth to identical twin boys in May, just as her husband, Brian, plans to start as press secretary for Hillary Rodham Clinton's impending presidential campaign in New York. President Obama makes an effort himself to have dinner with his wife and daughters most nights. The first family pictured above in a portrait for Easter. From left: 16-year-old Malia Obama, Michelle Obama, Barack Obama and Sasha Obama, 13, with dogs Sunny and Bo . Fallon said she made it clear when she took her job that they were trying to start a family. She said everyone has been accommodating - from cooks at the mess hall where her lunch orders have included a baked potato topped with tuna fish and frozen yogurt with Raisin Bran, all the way up to the president. 'He's constantly checking in on me,' she said, urging her not to miss doctor's appointments and to put her health first. 'Don't let us get in the way of that,' she said he's told her. Fallon and Psaki both say they envision working more flexible hours so they can put their babies to bed. Press secretary Josh Earnest - one of several new fathers in the West Wing - says he tries to get home once a week before his baby is asleep. Obama tries to make it to dinner every night with his wife and daughters. 'I don't think it would be appropriate for me to be home at 6:30 every night in the way that he is,' Earnest said at a Center for American Progress forum. But he said Obama's actions signal to staff they can make family a priority. Times have changed. Joan Baggett Calambokidis, President Bill Clinton's political director, is one of the only other assistants to the president that former White House aides can remember having a baby on the job. She spent her delivery taking calls from the West Wing to discuss the choice of a new party chair. 'The doctor said, \"I see the baby's head, you have to get off the phone,\"' she said. After Calambokidis returned from maternity leave, a newspaper reported her doctor advised her to resign for health reasons because the job was too stressful - a rumor she said was fabricated to push her out. 'You can take off four months but you aren't able to be in there to do the turf battles that you need to do,' she said. New on the job: Psaki started her new job as White House communications director on Wednesday, after serving in the same position for the State Department. Mr Obama pictured above walking with Psaki into the West Wing of the White House . 'All workplaces are adapting and that includes the White House,' Fallon said. Pictured above with Mr Obama walking out of the West Wing last year . Rhonda Keenum was a mother of 1-year-old triplets when she started as President George W. Bush's director of public liaison - a deputy assistant to the president. She was shocked to get pregnant again at 44 - and she wasn't the only one. Keenum said Bush pointed at her aboard Air Force One and said, 'I want to know how that happened,' as the first lady kicked him under the table. 'I said, \"Sir, I got knocked up.\" It was the only time I ever was irreverent with him.' Keenum said she took just two weeks maternity leave - the White House a welcome getaway from four in diapers at home. 'I knew the White House opportunity was short-term and motherhood was not.' Psaki said as she discussed whether to take the job with her husband, Greg Mecher, chief of staff to Massachusetts Democratic Representative Joe Kennedy, Obama called and personally pledged to support her needs. She said he told her, 'My wife would be mad if I didn't convey that having a baby is a wonderful experience and the best thing I'll ever do, but it's also hard. And we'll make it work.'\n"]}

To address these issues, the tech giant is recruiting for battery and power software experts. At least nine job listings have been spotted on the firm's official recruitment site as the company looks to boost the battery across its range of mobiles and laptops. Fan site AppleInsider has spotted nine job listings on Apple's official recruitment site in the past month that relate to batteries. These include one for an iOS battery life software engineer (pictured left) and another for iOS software power systems engineer (pictured right) The job listings were discovered by fan site AppleInsider and include listings for an iOS battery life software engineer, a software power\u00a0systems\u00a0engineer, battery pack engineering manager and a cell engineer. In particular, the iOS software power systems engineer role said the successful candidate 'will be working on design and development of software for triage of battery life issues, modeling of power consumed by different parts of the system, and analytics to understand large scale battery life trends.' Apple defines the Apple Watch battery on its Watch product page. It says\u00a0its all-day battery life is based on 18 hours of use. All-day battery life:\u00a0This includes 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music. Audio playback: The battery will last up to 6.5 hours when playing music. Talk time: Apple said the Watch can be used for up to three hours for calls. Workout: During this test the Watch lasted for seven hours when a workout session was active and the heart rate sensor was on. Watch: When used as a watch the device will last for 48 hours if checked five times an hour. Power reserve:\u00a0When the Apple Watch's battery  gets low it switches into Power Reserve mode letting users tell the time for up to 72 hours - with four time checks an hour. Charging time:\u00a0The company said it takes 1.5 hours to charge the Watch to 80% and 2.5 hours for a full charge. Apple's tests were carried out in March 2015 with a pre-production Apple Watch and software paired with an iPhone using pre-production software. Apple said battery life varies with environmental factors, use, configuration, and 'many other factors' so actual results will vary . As the site suggests, this shows Apple is looking to boost the battery on iOS devices but also its range of MacBooks. Apple's larger iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what 'normal usage' is and this can differ from person to person. These times have only been beaten by Samsung's latest Galaxy S6. Apple also said its new 12-inch MacBook uses 30 per cent less energy than the previous model and could last more than nine hours on a single charge. However, official figures suggest its Watch in particular will struggle to last for anywhere near that long. Boss Tim Cook said at the launch event last month that the Watch will last 18 hours, but this only includes 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music. Apple is expected to launch an iPhone 6S, 6S Plus as well as potentially a four-inch model later this year. Battery improvements could be made to these handsets, or they may be a feature on next year's iPhone 7. Alternatively, because a number of the jobs refer to a software rather than hardware engineer, these battery improvements could be made and rolled out to existing phones as part of an iOS upgrade. Earlier this week\u00a0Atmel released its latest  microcontrollers (MCUs) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can harvest energy from a person's body. The  SAM L microcontrollers are part of Atmel's 32-bit ARM-based MCU range and are powered by chip maker ARM's Cortex M0+ 32-bit processors. A number of Apple devices, including the iPhone 5S and iPad Air are powered by chips based around ARM technology. Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices such as fire alarms, healthcare, medical, wearable, and devices placed in rural, agriculture, offshore and other remote areas.' Apple's iPhone 6 and 6 Plus have been found to last about eight hours with heavy usage and up to 22 hours with normal usage - although its difficult to quantify what 'normal usage' is and this can differ from person to person. Apple also said its new 12-inch MacBook (pictured) uses 30% less energy than previous models . Apple boss Tim Cook said the Watch's 'all-day' battery life lasts 18 hours with 'typical use' - but official tests recently revealed this equates to just 90 time checks, 90 notifications, 45 minutes of app use, and a 30-minute workout with music.\u00a0Apple defines the battery on its Watch page and said a time check  lasts four seconds . They use a third of the power of rival chips and tests have shown they are the lowest power microprocessor ever made. The microcontrollers run on the firm's picoPower technology and\u00a0Atmel's Event System that makes different parts of the device work together to carry out tasks. By effectively 'sharing' energy, the whole device uses less power and, subsequently, less battery. It can also manage how much energy is being used by other components to make them as efficient as possible. Plus, the technology is so low power it can harvest energy from the body using changes in temperature. Earlier this week Atmel released its latest microcontrollers (MCUs) for a variety of gadgets that are so low power they can even harvest energy from a person's body.\u00a0Atmel said its MCUs extend 'battery life from years to decades, reducing the number of times batteries need to be changed in devices' During a demonstration of the microcontrollers at this year's CES, Andreas Eieland, Atmel's director of product marketing demonstrated how he could power a radio by placing his hand on a panel. This panel recognised a change in temperature between the hand and the room and this was harvested to create charge .\n"]}

{"question_id": 186, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: As California struggles with a devastating drought, huge amounts of water are mysteriously vanishing from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta \u2014 and the prime suspects are farmers whose families have tilled fertile soil there for generations. A state investigation was launched following complaints from two large agencies that supply water to arid farmland in the Central Valley and to millions of residents as far south as San Diego. Delta farmers don't deny using as much water as they need. But they say they're not stealing it because their history of living at the water's edge gives them that right. Still, they have been asked to report how much water they're pumping and to prove their legal rights to it. Scroll down for video . Drought: In this photo taken Friday March 27, 2015, low-flow water emitter sits on some of the dry, cracked ground of farmer Rudy Mussi's  almond orchard in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta near Stockton, California . Resources: Rudy Mussi watches his grandson, Lorenzo, 20 months, tries to turn a water valve on his almond orchard  in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (March 2015 file photo) At issue is California's century-old water rights system that has been based on self-reporting and little oversight, historically giving senior water rights holders the ability to use as much water as they need, even in drought. Gov. Jerry Brown has said that if drought continues this system built into California's legal framework will probably need to be examined. Delta farmer Rudy Mussi says he has senior water rights, putting him in line ahead of those with lower ranking, or junior, water rights. 'If there's surplus water, hey, I don't mind sharing it,' Mussi said. 'I don't want anybody with junior water rights leapfrogging my senior water rights just because they have more money and more political clout.' The fight pitting farmer against farmer is playing out in the Delta, the hub of the state's water system. With no indication of the drought easing, heightened attention is being placed on dwindling water throughout the state, which produces nearly half of the fruits, nuts and vegetables grown in the U.S. A large inland estuary east of San Francisco, the Delta is fed by rivers of freshwater flowing down from the Sierra Nevada and northern mountain ranges. Located at sea level, it consists of large tracts of farmland separated by rivers that are subject to tidal ebbs and flows. Most of the freshwater washes out to the Pacific Ocean through the San Francisco Bay. Some is pumped \u2014 or diverted \u2014 by Delta farmers to irrigate their crops, and some is sent south though canals to Central Valley farmers and to 25 million people statewide. The drought now in its fourth year has put Delta water under close scrutiny. Twice last year state officials feared salty bay water was backing up into the Delta, threatening water quality. There was not enough fresh water to keep out saltwater. Mussi, a second-generation Delta farmer, said Central Valley farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater . In June, the state released water stored for farmers and communities from Lake Oroville to combat the saltwater intrusion. Nancy Vogel, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Water Resources, said 'thousands of acre-feet of water a day for a couple of weeks' were released into the Delta. An acre-foot is roughly enough water to supply a household of four for a year. The fact that the state had to resort to using so much from storage raised questions about where the water was going. That in turn prompted a joint letter by the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation calling for an investigation into how much water Delta farmers are taking \u2014 and whether the amount exceeds their rights to it. 'We don't know if there were illegal diversions going on at this time,' said Vogel, leaving it up to officials at the State Water Resources Control Board to determine. 'Right now, a large information gap exists.' Some 450 farmers who hold 1,061 water rights in the Delta and the Sacramento and San Joaquin river watersheds were told to report their water diversions, and Katherine Mrowka, state water board enforcement manager, said a vast majority responded. State officials are sorting through the information that will help them determine whether any are exceeding their water rights and who should be subject to restrictions. 'In this drought period, water accounting is more important to ensure that the water is being used for its intended purpose,' said U.S. Bureau of Reclamation spokesman Louis Moore. Mussi, a second-generation Delta farmer whose family grows tomatoes, wheat, corn, grapes and almonds on 4,500 acres west of Stockton, said Central Valley farmers have long known that in dry years they would get little or no water from state and federal water projects and would need to rely heavily on groundwater. 'All of a sudden they're trying to turn their water into a permanent system and ours temporary,' Mussi said. 'It's just not going to work.' Shawn Coburn farms 1,500 acres along the San Joaquin River in Firebaugh about 100 miles south of the Delta. As a senior rights holder, he figures he will receive 45 percent or less of the water he expected from the federal water project. On another 1,500 acres where he is a junior water rights holder, he will receive no surface water for a second consecutive year. 'I don't like to pick on other farmers, even if it wasn't a drought year,' said Coburn. 'The only difference is I don't have a pipe in the Delta I can suck willy-nilly whenever I want.'\n"]}

This week incredible footage showed the moment an unusual 'apocalyptic' dust storm, known in Arabic as a haboob, struck Belarus, turning day to night, and China has suffered four massive sandstorms since the start of the year. Some experts have said that climate change bringing excessive heat can make some areas more susceptible to dust storms, but one European scientist pointed out that the number of dust storms over the decades has always been variable. Dark clouds start forming over the city of\u00a0Soligorsk, Belarus, as a sandstorm sweeps over the city . Within a matter of minutes, the storm had blocked out the sun, creating chaos on the city streets . A raging\u00a0sand storm sweeps in on the city of Golmud in north west China, where 200,000 people live . The sandstorm was the fourth to hit the area this year as authorities struggle to deal with the natural hazards . China's Meteorlogical Centre issued a blue alert as the sandstorms swept across the north of the country . Golmud was left covered in a remarkable red haze when the sand cloud blew across the city . The footage of the dust storm in Belarus, filmed from a high rise apartment, shows traffic moving along a busy street in the province of Salihorsk, south of the capital of Minsk on Monday afternoon. As dark clouds move over the city, the entire area is plunged into darkness - forcing motorists to turn on their lights as they navigate the darkened roads. The storm was caused by a cold front moving in from the Ukrainian-Belorusian border, reported\u00a0RT. Earlier this month\u00a0Britain was shrouded in a cloud of Saharan dust, known as 'blood rain,' as the temperatures soared. Blurred: The Shard, one of London's most iconic buildings, is pictured shrouded in 'blood rain' earlier this month . In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm (pictured) that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude . Dr Steven Godby, a geographer researching the effects of blown sand and dust at Nottingham Trent University, explained how these events can occur. 'The dust is produced from source areas in North Africa, incorporated into a northerly airflow and can travel long distances before being deposited as far away as the UK. 'However, the events we experience are small scale compared to those experienced closer to major dust sources. And incredible pictures also taken at the beginning of April showed the moment ferocious red sandstorms  devoured a city in China's north west. China's pollution hit cities are now having to cope with a fresh nuisance - the massive sandstorm that struck the north-west of the country being the fourth this year alone. The images show the city of Golmud, in the country's north west Qinghai Province, as it succumbs to a sweeping half-hour sandstorm which reduced the visibility to as little as 30 metres, according to The People's Daily Online. On April 1 a sandstorm could be seen enveloping much of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates . By April 4, it was beginning to stretch across the Arabia Sea towards Pakistan and India . China's National Meteorological Centre (NMC) issued a blue alert for the sandstorms. The red sand swept across the northern part of the country bringing strong winds and floating sand to the regions of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. The organisation advised residents to stay indoors and local authorities to brace for the clean-up operation after the sandstorms. China's four-tier colour-coded weather warning system signifies red as the most severe followed by orange, yellow and blue. Photos of the city of Dunhuang in the north-western province of Gansu show the thick orange haze coating the city's atmosphere and the lack of people on the streets gave the area an almost alien planet appearance. A local meteorologist said visibility was reduced to less than 50metres in downtown areas. In December a small town in Queensland, Australia, experienced a dust storm that residents said was unprecedented in magnitude. Clouds of dirt engulfed the town of Bedourie, in Queensland's south-west, bringing with it a thick, dusty night for more than 90 minutes. The Middle East has also experienced several huge sandstorms this year. This week Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran experienced severe dust storms and last week the Arabian Peninsula was hit by a sandstorm the size of the U.S. And in February raging sandstorms engulfed Israel, Palestine, Lebanon and Egypt causing the worst Israeli air pollution in years and whipping up huge waves in the Mediterranean Sea. The sandstorm hit Egypt after unusually warm and sunny weather for a February day, and the sky over downtown Cairo turned yellow and blotted out the sun, limiting visibility . Hazy: The Egyptian capital was transformed by the sandstorm\u00a0while Alexandria and nearby Dekheila ports were closed because of the weather . Red alert: The sandstorm in Egypt gave the country a Martian look . The storm, made up of accumulated dust carried from the far reaches of the Sahara Desert in North Africa also engulfed Cairo. Israel's Environmental Protection Ministry said air pollution levels were the country's worst in five years. The sandstorm that engulfed the Arabian Peninsula, meanwhile, wrecked havoc across the area, causing traffic accidents, the cancellation of hundreds of flights and triggering breathing difficulties among residents. Images showed the vast sandstorm sweeping its way across Saudi Arabia, Oman and the United Arab Emirates and reaching as far east as India and Pakistan over a period of seven days. It began on April 1, when high winds whipped up the sandstorm in northern Saudi Arabia before it consolidated and began moving southeastward across the peninsula to eventually cover an area almost as large as the United States, Discover Magazine reported. Along the way it caused chaos across the area's major cities including Riyadh and Dubai, where some locations were reduced to zero visibility, streets turned a shade of orange and schools were forced shut. The Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies said: 'The blowing sand reduced surface visibility to near zero at some locations, disrupting ground transportation, air traffic, and also closing schools. Dr Emilio Cuevas-Agull\u00f3, director of the Izana Atmospheric Research Center in Tenerife, Spain, told MailOnline that while it was difficult to say if there have been an increase in dust storms generally, population and urban growth in desert regions means an increased risk of people being affected by them. He said: \u2018We are more aware of the problem since we have much better monitoring, mainly from satellites, and forecast systems, in the last five to 10 years, and because the population growth and corresponding infrastructures increase in desert and arid regions, in recent decades, increasing vulnerability to the same dust episodes.\u2019 He added: \u2018Our longest dust records over the North Atlantic, downwind from the Sahara desert, which started in late 1970s show a great inter-annual variability and decadal changes, but we don't really see positive trends.\u2019 Severely reduced viability caused traffic chaos in Egypt's capital city . 'Visibility was reduced to 0.1 mile for several hours at Dubai International Airport, which is one of the world\u2019s busiest in terms of volume of flights.' More than 450 Saudi Arabian Airlines flights were cancelled between across three days which equalled 33 per cent of the carrier's 1,526 scheduled flights, the Saudi Gazette reported. On top of this, 678 flights were delayed and another 19 rerouted from airports in Jeddah, Riyadh and Dammam.

A Hungarian man has been convicted of luring young, gay Eastern European men to the United States for a horrific life of sex slavery. Andras Janos Vass, 25, was found guilty of human trafficking and racketeering felonies this week after grooming fellow Hungarians online then keeping them captive in New York City and Miami. Vass brought men to America with the promises of easy work and high wages - then took their travel documents, threatened their families, and made them spend 20 hours a day on sex work, prosecutors said. He was found guilty of the offences by a jury in Miami-Dade on Thursday, the Miami Herald reported. He faces a maximum sentence of 155 years in prison - and will spend at least 21 behind bars. Three of Vass's victims testified against him at the trial. Two said they were tempted to the United States after being contacted via Planet Romeo, a free dating site. According Gay Star News, the men believed they would be employed as legal escorts and make between $3,000 and $5,000 a month. The victims said they were flown to New York City in 2012 and forced to live in a tiny one-bedroom apartment. They were forced to perform sex work at all hours, either in person or live on webcams.

A customer in the Costco car park in Watford where the incident happened reported hearing a \u2018nasty crunch\u2019 as the 34-year-old\u2019s head hit the ground. Today, the man who pushed Mr Prasanna to his death was jailed for 11 years after admitting all he wanted was \u2018a few cheap packets of cigarettes\u2019. Mr Prasanna had just finished his purchases when he returned to his silver Transit van and loaded a large box containing 21 smaller boxes of cigarettes in his van. He took his trolley back to a bay and returned to see that the stock he had bought had been disturbed, Luton Crown Court heard. Mr Prasanna then gave chase as he saw a separate van speeding off. Prosecutor John Price QC said: \u2018Mr Prasanna courageously acted in an attempt to stop the driver getting away. \u2018With equal determination and with an utterly callous regard for his safety, the two men used violence that cost this man his life. \u2018Mr Prasanna was forced out but managed to hold onto the side of the vehicle before the door was shut and he fell to the ground.\u2019 A witness said it was as if he had been pushed or kicked away from the van. Nothing had been taken from Mr Prasanna\u2019s van. Last October cousins Patrick and James O\u2019Driscoll were handed jail terms of ten-and-a-half years and seven-and-a-half years after pleading guilty to the manslaughter of Mr Prasanna. The sentence of Patrick O\u2019Driscoll, who was driving the van, was later increased to 12 years on appeal. His cousin was in another vehicle at the scene while a third man, Michael McInerney, 34, was in the rear of the van Mr Prasanna chased. McInerney went on the run after he was arrested in December 2013 and bailed. A European Arrest Warrant was issued but he was arrested in Corby, Northamptonshire in December 2014. Today he was jailed for a total of 11 years - ten-and-a-half years for manslaughter, two years concurrent for conspiracy to steal, with six months consecutive from the suspended sentence. Defence barrister Henry Hughes said the father of three accepts responsibility for the death of a man who deserved no harm at all. Jailed: Michael McInerney was handed an 11 year sentence after admitting to pushing Mr\u00a0Prasanna . \u2018He will live with the horror of the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life.

Judge Michael Kay QC told McInerney: \u2018Mr Prasanna was a hard working man and a family man with a wife and two-and-a-half-year-old son. He is described as a devoted and very loving father and husband. \u2018I can\u2019t help but compare Mr Prasanna who was a hard-working and lawful citizen with you. What example are you setting to your three children? \u201c . \u2018You applied violence to get Mr Prasanna off the vehicle. You pushed him out of the vehicle which began the chain of events that led to his death.\u2019 McInerney, from Borehamwood, Hertforshire, who was living at the time in Radwell, Bedforshire, appeared via a video link from Woodhill Prison, Milton Keynes.

His pleas of guilty to alternative charges of manslaughter and conspiracy to steal were accepted by the prosecution. He had 17 convictions for 32 offences and operated with alias names and false dates of birth. At the time Mr Prasanna was attacked, McInerney was serving a seven month suspended sentence suspended for 15 months for a similar theft from a motor vehicle at a cash and carry in Sheerness, in which a man who tried to stop him fell into the road. The day before Mr Prasanna was killed, the two O\u2019Driscolls had carried out thefts and attempted thefts at Booker cash and carry stores in Dagenham, Chelmsford, Colchester and Ipswich.

{"question_id": 194, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)On Tuesday, a white police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina, was charged with murder for shooting an unarmed black man in the back. Officer Michael Slager was arrested after raw video surfaced showing him firing numerous shots at Walter Scott as Scott ran away from a traffic stop. The video footage contradicts Slager's statement that he felt threatened after Scott allegedly took his stun gun during a scuffle.  The Post and Courier reported that the FBI has opened an investigation into the shooting death along with the State Law Enforcement Division, while the South Carolina attorney general is investigating possible civil rights violations. Now, after watching the footage \u2014 which should remain in your memory for a long time to come \u2014 one could say that Slager shot Scott like a dog.  But then again, dogs usually are not treated this badly.  But the man was shot like a runaway slave. In this case, there was clear documented evidence of what occurred, and no room for fabrications.  Most police fatal shootings do not result in indictments because prosecutors conclude they are justifiable.  The police officer can always plant a gun on the suspect he shot to death, or like Slager, apparently place a Taser near Scott's body and concoct some story that his life was in danger. \"We can't bring Mr. Scott back, but something like this today can have a bigger precedence than just what happened here with Mr. Scott. Because what happened today doesn't happen all the time,\" said L. Chris Stewart, an attorney for the Scott family, at a press conference. \"I don't think that all police officers are bad cops, but there are some bad ones out there. And I don't want to see anyone get shot down the way that my brother got shot down,\" said Anthony Scott, brother of the victim. \"What if there was no video? What if there was no witness, or hero as I call him, to come forward?  Then this wouldn't have happened, because as you can see, the initial reports stated something totally different.  The officer said that Mr. Scott attacked him and pulled his Taser and tried to use it on him.  But somebody was watching,\" Stewart added. \"After watching the video, the senseless shooting and taking of #WalterScott's life was absolutely unnecessary and avoidable,\" tweeted Sen. Tim Scott.  \"My heart aches for the family and our North Charleston community. I will be watching this case closely.\" Although the black community and others have been aware for years of the problem of police brutality, through personal experience and anecdotes, the data confirm that police use of deadly force is a black and white issue. A ProPublica analysis of police shootings from 2010 to 2012 found that young black males are 21 times more likely to be fatally shot by the police than young white males.  And 67% of teens killed while fleeing or resisting arrest were black. Of the whites who are killed by cops, 91% are killed by white cops. Sixty-eight percent of people of color who are killed by police are also killed by white officers.  Furthermore, 10% of police involved in fatal shootings are black, and 78% of the people killed by black officers are black. According to Cynthia Lee of George Washington University Law School, the disproportionate representation of blacks and other people of color in police shootings is due to the role of racial stereotypes by police.  Racial stereotypes, Lee argues, subconsciously influence an officer's decision on whether to use deadly force, even if the police do not consciously decide to use deadly force based on race.  A simple question posed to the officer by a black person could be perceived as a threat to the officer's authority. What's more, a Washington State University study on deadly force found that participants felt more threatened in scenarios involving black suspects, suggesting participants \"held subconscious biases associating blacks and threats.\" Scott is the latest in a long line of black bodies, from Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, to John Crawford III near Dayton, Ohio, and Tanisha Anderson and Tamir Rice in Cleveland. In this case, the bystander video of Scott's killing and the cover-up of the crime by Slager made the difference.  Otherwise, the bogus narrative of the good white cop protecting himself from the menacing black thug may have prevailed. What happened in North Charleston tells us the epidemic of police deadly force has not died.  And yet, the mobilization and heightened consciousness of people across the nation have kept the issue on the front burner. The taking of black lives by the police remains a crisis situation in America that must be addressed, because #BlackLivesMatter. May Walter Scott rest in peace. The arrest and charging of Officer Michael Slager is a rare event that must be celebrated for the small victory that it is, in the midst of unspeakable tragedy.  But this is by no means over.\n"]}

Researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings are usually reported, often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould, which can affect our brains. Exposure to the mould can cause mood swings, irrational anger and cognitive impairment. All an illusion? Researchers claim that older buildings where hauntings (illustrated by a stock image) are usually reported, often have poor air quality from pollutants like toxic mould, which can affect our brains . \u2018Experiences reported in many hauntings are similar to mental or neurological symptoms reported by individuals exposed to toxic moulds,\u2019 said Professor Shane Rogers of Clarkson University in Potsdam, New York. \u2018Psychoactive effects of some fungi are well-known, whereas the effects of others such as indoor moulds are less researched. \u2018Although allergy and asthma symptoms and other physiological effects are well established, there has long been controversy over the effects of indoor mould exposure on cognitive and other functioning of the brain. \u2018Reports of psychiatric symptoms including mood swings, hyperactivity, and irrational anger, as well as cognitive impairment are prevalent among those exposed to moulds. Brain drain: Exposure to the mould can cause mood swings, irrational anger and cognitive impairment, among other problems. A stock image of toxic mould in the firm of Stachybotrys chartarum spores, is shown . 'Ghosts' tend to be sighted in old buildings, which are often more likely to have damp and mould problems. No-one is exactly sure of the psychoactive effects of indoor moulds on the brain. But spores have been linked with mood swings, hyperactivity, and irrational anger, as well as cognitive impairment. Recent reports indicate that exposure to toxic mould spores may cause brain inflammation and memory loss. A team of researchers are exploring whether the mould may cause people to think they have seen ghosts, by comparing conditions in 'haunted' and non-haunted old buildings. \u2018Other reports include depression and loss of memory function. \u2018More recent work is emerging that supports brain inflammation and memory loss in mice exposed to Stachybotrys charatarum, a common indoor air mould, as well as increased anxiety and fear.\u2019 Professor Rogers is currently leading a team of researchers measuring air quality in several reportedly haunted places around New York State. The group will compare samples taken from several buildings where ghost sightings have been reported with samples taken from properties with no paranormal activity, to see if there is a difference in the types of fungi. Professor Rogers said: \u2018I have long been a fan of ghost stories and shows related to investigation of haunted places and have to admit to some strange occurrences in my own past. \u2018Many of the places under investigation and from my own experiences may be prime environments for mould and other indoor air quality issues. \u2018We would like to see if we can parse out some commonality between the mould microbiome in places that are haunted relative to those that are not.\u2019 The real ghost busters: Here, undergraduate environmental engineering students (from left to right) Thomas O'Rourke and Daniel C. Schwab work with Professor Shane Rogers to sample air quality in buildings associated with alleged ghost activity .

Co-pilot Andreas Lubitz, who was being treated for depression, was able to override a security system installed on flights following the 9/11 attacks as he flew the aircraft into the ground. Guidance issued by the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI), a security agency accountable to the director general of MI5, recommends continuous psychological assessment of key employees, with the highest priority given to workers whose jobs pose the greatest risk to the public.

Rescue workers and investigators work near debris at the crash site of the Germanwings Airbus A320 . A CPNI study showed that three-quarters of insider acts were carried out by employees who had no malicious intent when joining the organisation, but whose loyalties changed after recruitment.

Some of the more common insider acts include unauthorised disclosure of information \u2013 such as in the case of US whistleblower Edward Snowden \u2013 process corruption (where an employee illegitimately alters an internal process for their own ends) and corporate espionage.

The orbiting spacecraft captured a shot of Curiosity near the base of Mount Sharp in Gale Crater. But interestingly, the rover\u2019s tracks are not visible - possibly because they have been swept away by the Martian weather. The HiRise camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches (25cm) per pixel, allowing it to spot the rover on the surface. It is seen here in the full image, circled. The rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light-toned outcrops of rock . The image was taken using the High-Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRise) camera on the Martian satellite, from a height of 187 miles (300km) above the surface. The rover's top speed is 1.5 inches (3.8 centimetres) per second. Curiosity is the fourth rover to visit Mars. It took around seven minutes to land on the Red Planet. The rover is fitted with 17 cameras. It weighs about the same as a Mini Cooper at approximately 900kg (2,000lbs). Scientists considered 60 possible landing sites before deciding on Gale Crater. It is not the first time it has spotted Curiosity, or indeed other rovers, on the surface - but it is the first time in 2015. The HiRise camera is able to take images of the surface with a resolution of 10 inches (25cm) per pixel, allowing it to see Curiosity, which is the size of a car. In this image the rover is parked over dark sand in a valley with light-toned outcrops of rock. These rocks are part of the Pahrump Hills in the Murray Formation, which is an area of sandstones, siltstones and calcium sulphate veins on the surface. They are the lowest exposed rocks of Mount Sharp - also known as Aeolis Mons - which Nasa is planning to send Curiosity up at some point. In the image the rover had recently completed a drive of about 75ft (23 metres) during its 949th day on Mars - also known as a sol. North is towards the top in the image, with the entire view spanning about 1,640ft (500 metres) across. Curiosity has been driving a route through an area called Artist\u2019s Drive, on its way to the higher layers of Mount Sharp after examining Pahrump Hills. Its ultimate science destination, Logan Pass, is at the bottom left of the image. Nasa scientists in California have revealed a distant image of Curiosity (shown). It was taken by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter from 187 miles up. One interesting aspect is that the rover's tracks cannot be seen. This may be due to Martian weather or they blend in with the surface . Here's the view from the surface: Curiosity took this image of Artist's Drive around a similar time that the MRO spacecraft spotted it from orbit. The rover is now on its way to a region called Logan Pass . Aside from keeping track of the rover, this image also allows scientists to monitor nearby sand dunes. And the absence of the rover\u2019s tracks also hints at one of two possibilities. It may be that Martian wind has swept them away, or it could be that the dark sand dug up by the wheels as they move is a similar colour to the surface, and thus indistinguishable. The last time Curiosity was spotted from orbit was more than four months ago. Another benefit of taking this sort of image is to find upcoming landmarks that might be of interest for the rover. Curiosity has now been on Mars for almost 1,000 days, having landed on 6 August 2012. Shown here is a mosaic of images creating a self-portrait of the rover, which makes it look like someone else has taken it .\n"]}

A hearing in the case is scheduled for Friday in Alexandria. The ex-student has sued under a pseudonym to protect his privacy. The university is demanding he identify himself publicly, despite arguments that doing so would expose not only him but the woman who says she was assaulted. The student says he had been in a longstanding relationship with the woman, and that they frequently engaged in sadomasochistic role playing that involved using a safe word if one or the other wanted to stop. Lawsuit:\u00a0A student expelled from GMU for violating its sexual misconduct policy is suing in federal court to clear his name, arguing that an encounter with a girlfriend was sadomasochistic role playing, not sexual assault (file) The lawsuit comes as colleges across the country, and particularly in Virginia, are under increased scrutiny for how they respond to allegations of sexual assault. The University of Virginia implemented changes in its sexual misconduct policy in the aftermath of a now-discredited Rolling Stone article alleging that school officials were indifferent to allegations that a student had been raped at a fraternity party. The sexual misconduct allegations at George Mason stem from an October 2013 encounter with the couple in the male student's dorm room on the Fairfax campus. At one point, according to the lawsuit, she pushed him away but didn't invoke her safe word. Later that night, the two engaged in a second sex act, in which the male student asked her if she was interested, and she replied, 'I don't know.' According to the lawsuit, the couple remained romantically involved for several months, but they broke up after she found that he had been cheating on her. It was only then that she filed a complaint against him, according to the suit. In September, a university panel conducted a 10-hour hearing to determine whether the student had violated the university's code of conduct. A three-person panel cleared him of any wrongdoing, according to the suit. But the woman appealed, and a university administrator, Assistant Dean of Students Brent Ericson, overruled the panel and expelled the student. Process:\u00a0The lawsuit claims the woman only filed a complaint after the couple broke up and she had found out the man was cheating on her (file) The lawsuit says that the appeal was handled improperly. It seeks an order that would strike the violation from his student record, and $3 million in damages. The lawsuit claims that the expulsion was a result of gender bias, and also claims that it violated his right to engage in constitutionally protected sexual activity. 'The only explanation for such a rash, unreasoned, and unsupported decision is Mr. Ericson's desire to help a complaining female when the system had found a respondent male not responsible. If Jane Roe (the pseudonym for the unidentified female student) were not a female complaining of sexual assault, her testimony would not have been credited over John Doe's given the evidence corroborating John Doe's explanation of their BDSM relationship and the material concessions Jane Roe made at the hearing,' the student's lawyers wrote in their complaint. A GMU spokeswoman declined comment on the lawsuit. The university, in court papers, wants to overturn a judge's decision allowing the student to sue anonymously. The university's lawyer writes that the male student should have no fear of embarrassment if the allegations are true, because the public is increasingly accepting of unusual sexual relationships. And he argues the risk of the woman's identity being exposed is minimal compared to the public's right to an open judicial proceeding. 'Even if Ms. Roe is identified simply by the fact that Mr. Doe is identified, there is nothing in the record to suggest Ms. Roe will be subjected to retaliatory harm,' Assistant Attorney General David Drummey wrote on behalf of the university.\n"]}

The tragic accident claimed the lives of Josh and Vanessa Ellis and baby Hudson, who were crushed when the 50-foot-long concrete slab slammed down on top of them, according to Bonney Lake Police. The barrier weighed 'tons' according to investigators and the damage to the family's pickup truck was so great that it took them hours to extract the bodies. Scroll down for video .

Fatal: The married couple and their baby were driving underneath the state's Route 410 overpass in Bonney Lake - where workers were installing a sidewalk - on Monday morning. Above, the scene . Shockingly, authorities thought that only one person had been killed by the impact, but discovered to their horror that an entire family had been crushed to death according to KIRO TV. While America once had the world's best road and transportation network system, but now it is crumbling. Indeed, according to a former US Transport Secretary, Ray LaHood said there are 70,000 bridges that have been deemed structurally deficient across the nation. LaHood made this damning statistic abundantly clear when he told CBS News, 'I don't want to say they're unsafe. But they're dangerous. I would agree with that.' Moreso, every four years, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) releases its comprehensive assessment of the state of US infrastructure. In its most recent one, from 2013, it gave the nation a grading of D+. Across the United States there are 607,380 bridges according to the ASCE and they have an average lifespan of 42 years. Out of those bridges, one in nine is considered to be structurally problematic. Chief among those are the Storrow Drive Bridge in Boston, which has cement too thick for its steel structure to continue supporting and the US Route 1/9 Bridge over the Passaic River in New Jersey, which is rusted. One of the reasons why things have got so bad is due of course to dwindling investment. From 1950 to the 1990s, the investment in infrastructure across the nation stood at two percent of GDP. That fell to 1.5 percent in 2012. As a comparison China spends seven percent of its GDP on infrastructure and India, five percent. So large is the problem, that experts have said that either an upsurge in money to rebuilding the nation is needed, or the country will begin to suffer huge problems over the next generation. Source: The Week/CBS . Bonney Lake police Officer Todd Green told the\u00a0New York Daily News that the Ellis family would likely have died on impact and not known much about the accident. He said he was confident about this assessment because they found no break marks under the bridge, leading him to believe they had no warning. 'This is a very unfortunate and sad circumstance, especially in a town this size,' Green said. 'This is something that will hit our community big time.' The couple celebrated their five year wedding anniversary in early March and were pastors at their local church. At the time of the incident, construction crews were working on the sidewalk installation project, it is reported. When they finally managed to reach the damaged truck, they found the victims inside. 'We were just heading down the street ... and I could hear three snaps and down it went on top of the truck,' witness Dawn Nelson, who was riding in a car behind the pickup, told KING-TV. She added: 'There was nothing anyone could do. It was just surreal.' It remains unknown what caused the 'very heavy' concrete structure to fall, King 5 reported. City spokesman Woody Edvalson said the material that fell in Bonney Lake - situated around 30 mile southeast of Seattle, Washington - was part of the original span, which was built in 1992. It has a sufficiency rating of 95.3 out of 100, according to The News Tribune.

But until now the only way to enjoy a tipple with that gorgeous authentic taste that can only develop through spending years in a special wooden cask has been to pay through the nose. The second I see the word \u2018spicy\u2019 on a bottle label (which suggests an oaky flavouring), I instantly know the price will be much higher. A \u00a35 bottle has suddenly become \u00a312 because the wine has lingered in an oak barrel before bottling. So when I read this week about a new gadget that claims to be able to \u2018oak age\u2019 wine in hours rather than years, my curiosity was seriously roused. The Oak Bottle promises to impart an authentic aged flavour \u2014 a process that can take up to two years \u2014 in just a day or two. Who wouldn\u2019t drink to that? Scroll down for video . TV wine expert Oz Clarke puts to the test this oak bottle that claims to 'oak age' wine in hours rather than years . The product, which retails at \u00a350, is the brainchild of 30-year-old entrepreneur Joel Paglione. Growing up on his parents\u2019 vineyard in Canada, Joel became fascinated by the process of ageing wine. Watching his dad painstakingly filling small barrels of wine for oaking, he wondered why the wine couldn\u2019t be stored in the same huge vats that had been used to ferment it. When Mr Paglione Snr explained that the smaller the oak barrel, the faster the oak infusion, Joel got his Eureka moment. How about a bottle made out of oak which will \u2018oak age\u2019 a single bottle in a fraction of the time? Now, after three years of experimenting, Joel has developed what he claims is the \u2018smallest possible oak infusion vessel ever made.\u2019 The idea is you decant a bottle of wine into the oak bottle, leave for up to 48 hours (depending on the strength of the oak flavour you fancy) and \u2014 hey presto! \u2014 your supermarket bottle of plonk fresh from last year\u2019s grape harvest should suddenly taste like a posh wine from a world-class vineyard that has had years to mature and develop oaky flavours. Ageing a wine overnight is the holy grail of wine lovers. It\u2019s like finding the elixir of eternal youth \u2014 in reverse. But can a simple gizmo really mimic such a time-honoured process? Can I turn a cheap plonk into a lovingly aged wine? I\u2019m eager to try. When it arrives, the Oak Bottle looks like a wooden version of the thermos flask I take on picnics. It\u2019s plain and reassuringly sturdy. For my test I choose a Bulgarian Merlot (Simply Merlot, Tesco \u00a34.20). It\u2019s an unpretentious, fruity wine, great for glugging, but it\u2019s hardly stellar quality. However, as with the French wines such as Bordeaux and Burgundy, Argentinian Melbecs, Australian Shirazes and, of course, the Spanish Rioja, once you add oak to a Merlot you are entering a whole new world \u2014 and price bracket. Merlots benefit hugely from being oak aged. I\u2019m itching to start my test. But first I have to fill the Oak Bottle with water. Oak shrinks when dried out, so the instructions warn me the Oak Bottle is inclined to leak until it is sealed using lukewarm water to swell and close up any open wood grain. Sure enough, water drips out over the next two hours \u2014 enough to saturate the kitchen towel I put underneath. Eventually, the wood ready and the drips stop. Now I can start. I pour out the water, decant my Merlot, pop the stopper on and wait. Joel suggests the whole process can take anything from 24 to 48 hours. That\u2019s a drop in the ocean compared to the 12-to-18 month ageing process in a proper barrel. The Celts weren\u2019t wine drinkers but apparently were the first to use oak barrels to store and transport their beer and mead. The wine-loving Romans leapt at the invention \u2014 they were sick of their ceramic jugs crashing and breaking on long sea voyages. The Oak Bottle promises to impart an authentic aged flavour . They quickly discovered the wooden barrels not only added flavours to the wine but, because wood is porous, also allowed air (specifically, what we know as oxygen) to permeate the contents slowly, removing harsh flavours. In fact, that\u2019s the other reason we pay such a premium for barrel-aged wines \u2014 the oxygen changes the molecules in the wine, sweetens the acids, softens the bitter bits and lets the tannins (or sediment) drop to the bottom, giving it a gorgeous rich mellowness. Great European winemakers have been using the same technique ever since. It\u2019s still all done by hand. Barrels, which hold up to 300 bottles of wine, can cost well over \u00a31,000, with the price determined by the quality of the oak that\u2019s been used and the skill of the cooper making them. While the overwhelming aroma you get from oak is vanilla, if the wood is toasted a bit over a fire, you also get nutty flavours of hazelnuts and almonds. Toast even longer and you add chocolatey flavours and, later, coffee and burnt toast. The skill of the winemaker is deciding just how much flavour he wants in his barrel. All these flavours infuse the wine. And it takes months. Can the Oak Bottle \u2014 which apparently has a \u2018medium toast\u2019 flavour \u2014 do the same in just one day? And, just as important \u2014 can it turn a young fruity wine into a vintage quaff? If it can, I\u2019ll be the first to splash out \u00a350. The length of time you leave your wine in the Oak Bottle depends how oaky you like it \u2014 but it\u2019s advisable to sample the contents regularly. Therefore, 14 hours into the experiment, I decide to see how the magic is working. Pulling out the stopper, sadly, has none of the heady satisfaction of uncorking a bottle. But I\u2019m prepared to overlook the disappointment if the taste is right. As I take my first sniff, I immediately get a delicious aroma of vanilla. My spirits rise, but after the first sip they crash. It\u2019s wine \u2014 with a hint of furniture polish. Even though the wine has been in the Oak Bottle for less than 24 hours, the taste of wood is overpowering. All the natural freshness of the fruity young Merlot has disappeared. I feel like I\u2019m licking a plank of wood. Oz Clarke said the Oak Bottle is a fun product that would certainly make an interesting gift for a wine buff . In a traditionally oak-aged wine, the woody flavours would integrate over many months to give a rich, mellow taste. But this has been forced. This might be remedied by leaving the wine in the bottle for less time. In fact, the Oak Bottle\u2019s developers say you can taste the wine every hour until you reach a level of oakiness appropriate for that particular bottle. I also think the Oak Bottle might actually improve the more times you use it. With each use, I imagine the strong oak flavour will fade. This is because alcohol, which is solvent, dissolves the flavours from inside the bottle. The Oak Bottle is the result of three years of experiments . For example, in winemaking a producer might empty his oak barrel after 18 months. At this point some 80 per cent of the flavours created by the barrel will have disappeared. Reuse the barrel, and there should be only 20 per cent of the oak-lined flavour left. By the third time you use the barrel, you might only have 5 per cent of the original flavour. I suspect it will be the same with the Oak Bottle, so those overpowering notes of beeswax furniture polish would mellow. The Oak Bottle is a fun product, and would certainly make an interesting gift for a wine buff. But there is another trick you can use to improve wine. Simply open your bottle of wine, pour half a glass, screw the top back on (or put in a stopper) and give the bottle a good shake. This forces oxygen into the wine, loosening the flavours and making it more drinkable. Leave for five minutes before you enjoy. Perfect \u2014 and it won\u2019t cost you a penny.\n"]}

Perhaps the most embarrassing of the accusations is that Menendez used his influence to get visas for married Melgen's multiple young lovers abroad - including a Brazilian model who posed on the cover of 'Sexy' magazine and a Ukrainian actress who moved to Florida to live in one of Melgen's homes.

U.S. Senator Robert Menendez faces the possibility of 15 years in prison if convicted of eight counts of bribery for using his political influence to help a wealthy donor in exchange for nearly $1million in campaign contributions and gifts . Melgen's ladies: According to an indictment unsealed this month, Menendez helped donor Dr Salomon Melgen bring at least three mistresses to the U.S. on visas - including Brazilian actress Juliana Lopes Leite (left) and Ukrainian model Svitlana Buchyk (right) Menendez and Melgen met at a fundraiser in 1993, shortly after Menendez was voted into the Senate. The two quickly became close, with Menendez being invited to fly on Melgen's private jet and visit his villa in the Dominican Republic on several occasions. According to the details in the indictment, Menendez began helping out his rich friend in 1998, when Melgen wanted to fly a 22-year-old girlfriend - identified as 'girlfriend 2 in court documents - and her 18-year-old sister from the Dominican Republic to spend Christmas with him in the States. Claiming innocence: Melgen has also been charged in the indictment, in addition to other Medicaid fraud charges, pleading not guilty to both. He is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Miami . Despite Melgen writing a letter to the embassy in Santo Domingo, the sisters' applications were initially denied due to the fact that they were unemployed and therefore more likely to overstay their visas. When Melgen found got the bad news, he reached out to his friend Menendez for help. Menendez then told his senior policy adviser Mark Lopes that he planned to personally call the ambassador and, if that didn't work, a contact at the State Department. An unidentified high-ranking member in the State Department allegedly responded by telling Menendez that he agreed with the visa decision. Nevertheless, a few weeks later the sisters were re-interviewed and this time their visas were approved. Lopes emailed a colleague after and wrote that it was 'ONLY DUE to the fact that RM intervened.' Menendez next helped Melgen in 2007, when the doctor was trying to get another young woman to visit him in the U.S. The woman identified as 'girlfriend 3' in court documents is described as a Ukrainian actress and model who was 20 years old and living in Spain around the time at Menendez intervened in her immigration process. According to the indictment, a Menendez staffer reached out to the U.S. consul general in Madrid on behalf of a 'famous person in Spain' who was a 'good friend' of Melgen and needed a visa to 'undergo medical evaluation for plastic surgery in the U.S'. 'Dr Melgen is a person of the highest caliber,' Menendez wrote . 'He is a fine citizen and held in high esteem by his peers.' It's believed that 'girlfriend 3' is model Svitlana Buchyk, now 28, a woman who has been tied to Melgen and who lived in Spain before moving to Florida. Svitlana made headlines in Florida in 2010 when she crashed a car that was registered in Melgen's wife's name. At the time, Buchyk gave police Melgen's address in North Palm Beach as her own. When contacted the the Miami Herald at the time, she told the paper that she worked for Melgen in the past but would not describe what that work involved. 'He treated me well,' she said. 'He had money. He was very generous.' She now allegedly goes by the name Lana Moyzuk and lives in Los Angeles. Employee? Melgen's alleged mistress Svitlana Buchyk (pictured) made headlines in Florida in 2010 when she crashed a car belonging to Melgen's wife. She told the Miami Herald at the time that she used to work for Melgen, but would not saw in what capacity . It appears Melgen may have been juggling women in 2007, when he brought Buchyk to the U.S., since he also reportedly started dating a famous Brazilian actress that same year. Menendez is also accused of intervening to help this woman to the U.S. a few years later, when she wanted to study law at the University of Miami. The Post has identified \u00a0'girlfriend 1' as 34-year-old Juliana Lopes Leite, who once appeared on Brazil's version of Big Brother and posed nude in several magazines before her move to the U.S. to become a lawyer. The indictment says Menendez knew Leite was one of Melgen's paramours when he agreed to help with her visa application, ordering his adviser Lopes to write a letter in the woman's favor to the State Department. In the letter, lopes wrote that Leite '(no relation to me) \u00a0has her visa application appointment in Brasilia, Brazil, tomorrow . . . Sen. Menendez would like to advocate unconditionally for Dr. Melgen and encourage careful consideration of [Girlfriend 1]\u2019s visa application.' The State Department got back to Menendez's office in just a few hours later and the following day Leite's visa was approved. She graduated from the University of Miami in 2011, and still resides in the city as a lawyer. Melgen is also facing charges in the indictment unsealed this month, in addition to separate 76-count indictment for Medicaid fraud. He remains behind bars at the Federal Detention Center in Miami after being deemed a flight risk.

As the president started to repeat himself, Osman politely stepped in: 'Yeah. I think you've sort of covered everything about that question,' he said as the audience laughed.

During an answer about writer's block, Obama started getting a little long-winded and Osman stepped in . Obama grinned and replied, 'Osman thinks I've been talking too long.' 'No, I think you just\u2026' Yahya hesitated. 'No. Let's move it along, I got you,' Obama agreed. The president had been talking about the topic for more than three minutes when Yahya politely intervened after shifting nerviously in his seat. Obama was at the Anacostia Library in Washington for a 'virtual field trip' with students to promote White House initiatives to make free e-books available to low-income students and to get cities to provide access to universal library cards. Yaya also managed to skillfully tease details about Obama's early reading habits, his post-presidency plans and his facility with digital media. Middle schoolers at a Washington library and students watching online may have puzzled over Obama's reference to the Hardy Boys, just like Obama appeared stumped by Osman's mention of Alex Rider. 'Yeah. I think you've sort of covered everything about that question,' he said as the audience laughed . Obama grinned and replied, 'Osman thinks I've been talking too long' 'And our first question is from Mrs. Cook's second-grade class at Pinegrove Elementary School in Alabama,' Osman began. 'They asked: \"As a child, did you enjoy reading?\" Well, you said you loved reading, so that question is done. And they also asked: \"If so, what type of books spark your imagination and interest?'\" Obama conceded that the youngsters probably didn't read the Hardy Boys mysteries anymore and said he had been fond of the book Treasure Island. What did Osman read, he asked. Osman described the Alex Rider spy books and their gadgets and offered to lend Obama some books. Then, with a bit of sympathy, he added: 'To make you feel younger, my best friend read Treasure Island.' When Osman asked why it was important to have access to electronic books, Obama, a father of two teenage girls, revealed every parents' knowledge of the digital age. Obama was at the Anacostia Library in Washington for a 'virtual field trip' with students to promote White House initiatives to make free e-books available to low-income students . 'So you're texting all day and you're looking at Vine and Instagram, and you're looking at Grumpy Cat or some video of your favorite singer, rapper,' Obama said. 'What that means is, is that we want to make sure that that becomes a tool not just for entertainment, not just for talking to your friends, but also for learning. ' Asked what inspired him to be president, Obama conceded he had once harbored wishes to be an architect or basketball player but was ultimately inspired by the civil rights movement. As for his post-presidency career, the president seemed to suggest he might just return to his old job as a community organizer. 'I'll still be pretty young,' he said. 'And so I'll go back to doing the kinds of work that I was doing before, just trying to find ways to help people \u2014 help young people get educations, and help people get jobs, and try to bring businesses into neighborhoods that don't have enough businesses.'\n"]}
{"question_id": 208, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: The Zulu king blamed for sparking the violence against foreigners which has seen South Africa's streets turn into battlefields running with blood over the past two weeks is no stranger to scandal. It was just a couple of years ago that King Goodwill Zwelithini - who last month said foreigners should 'pack their belongings' and leave - labelled homosexuals as 'rotten'. The dyed-in-the-wool traditionalist has also courted the wrath of women's rights and HIV/Aids campaigners for his hardline stance on controversial traditional virginity testing. Scroll down for video . Controversial: King Goodwill Zwelithini (pictured) has been blamed for sparking the xenophobic riots which has left at least seven dead in the last couple of weeks as it spreads from Durban to Johannesburg . Horrific: The brutal murder of Mozambican man Emmanuel Sithole in a township near Johannesburg was captured on camera. Zwelithini has been\u00a0blamed for sparking outbursts of xenophobic violence like this . Xenophobia: The King is said to have told followers in a speech that foreigners were 'lice' and 'ants' and should be expelled from South Africa - a charge he denies, saying it was bad translation . Frenzy: A burnt-out car in the Jeppestown area of Johannesburg. King Zwelithini\u00a0recently told a crowd of 10,000 that if he had really ordered people to be killed 'this country would be reduced to ashes' Obscene: Zola Mafu arrives at the Ondini Sports Complex in Ulundi in a Rolls Royce for her wedding to King Zwelithini in July. She became his sixth wife at the lavish ceremony . King Zwelithini resurrected the outdated custom, in the face of widespread opposition, by claiming it helped the country's fight against HIV/Aids. But more recently, there was the revelation that he was bankrupt - despite the 54million rand (\u00a33million) handed to him from the South African government to keep the 67-year-old, his six wives and 28 children in the style to which they are accustomed. And, as a man who likes to spend more on his birthday cake than many of his subjects earn in a lifetime, it is quite some lifestyle. While King Zwelithini continues to enjoy all the trappings of his royal status, South African authorities arrested 11 men in Johannesburg late on Tuesday suspected of involvement in violence against immigrants, local television news reported. The men were held during a joint raid by the police and army on a Johannesburg hostel. A wave of anti-immigrant violence has so far claimed seven lives in trouble spots in Durban and Johannesburg, to where the government announced the deployment of defence forces on Tuesday. A speech given by the King in Durban last month, denouncing foreigners as 'ants' and 'lice' who should leave the country, has been blamed for sparking the violence. The hellish scenes across townships in South Africa are a far cry from King Zwelithini's opulent marriage to his sixth wife Zola Mafu, a 28-year-old princess from the neighbouring kingdom of Swaziland, in July, which included a marquee, catering and flowers for 5,000 invited guests. According to South Africa's Sunday Times, the monarch paid out more than \u00a355,000 on catering, around \u00a310,000 on a sound system and \u00a315,000 on decorations and flowers. In total, the extravaganza, attended by 5,000 people, cost an estimated \u00a3250,000. Maintaining all six wives, their children and grandchildren in separate palaces, with generous allowances, private school fees and a retinue of personal staff, requires substantial funding, according to reports. And he decided they all needed new, imported military regalia to wear to the opening of KwaZulu Natal's state legislature later this year - at the not insignificant price of \u00a3155,000, the Times claimed. Defence: Zwelithini also claimed his words were badly translated in 2012 when he called gay people 'rotten' Nuptials: His wedding to sixth wife Zola Mafu (pictured) in July cost an estimated R4million, or about \u00a3250,000 . Opulent: Another scene from Mafu's wedding to the king. She was selected as his bride at the age of 18 while participating in the 2003 Swazi reed dance . Power: Zwelithini's speech last month is said to be the cause of the violence which has turned the streets into a battleground, sending foreigners running for the safety of special camps . Luxurious: But the King - pictured here right at the annual reed dance at eNyokeni Royal Palace last year - more often comes under fire for lavish spending on his six wives, 28 children and numerous grandchildren . Funding: Zwelithini is given R54million (about \u00a33million) by the South African government each year . But that is not to say the King, who became leader of South Africa's biggest tribal group aged just 20 in 1968, does not have previous form on exorbitant expenditure. In 2012, King Zwelithini asked for half a million pounds for a new palace for Queen Mafu - as well as an extra million pounds on fifth wife Queen MaMchiza's home, in Nongoma, which boasts five royal residences. Four years before, the royal family had come under fire for spending more than \u00a316,000 on linen. And just last month, the Sunday Times reported that the King had bought each of his queens a new Mercedes-Benz E-Class sedan, in addition to a seventh model 'as a back up'. The monarch's opulent lifestyle is in stark contrast to millions of South Africans who, more than two decades after winning freedom, still do not have access to basic services such as clean water and electricity. But despite opposition politicians hitting out at the huge amounts lavished upon King Zwelithini and his family, it is unlikely to change. As South Africa celebrates 21 years of democracy next week, the largesse enjoyed by the king at the taxpayers' expense appears assured \u2013 at least while controversial president and fellow Zulu Jacob Zuma clings to power. Mr Zuma, who himself has four wives and at least 20 children, has relied on the influential leader to deliver political support, both to him personally and the governing ANC. Joy: The new King and Queen celebrate during their wedding, yet Zwelithini is a man who likes to spend more on his birthday cake than many of his subjects earn in a lifetime . Bankrupt: But the King (centre) ran out of money last year following a particularly expensive few months, and had to beg for more funds - which the government, led by fellow Zulu Jacob Zuma (left), approved . Households: The King has also asked for more than a million pounds to build or renovate his wives' palaces . Followers: But despite the extravagances, the King - pictured with Prince Charles in 2011 - is still adored by millions of people, many impoverished, willing to follow his every instruction . Raid: Zulu hostel dwellers on the staircase during a joint South African Police and army raid in Johannesburg yesterday. The raid was aimed at tackling gangs which have been hunting down and killing foreigners . Hands up: Zulus up against a wall waiting to be searched during the police raid on the hostel last night . Fearful: Potential gang members lie face down on the floor during the police and army action at the hostel . In return, the king enjoys a budget far higher than South Africa's other royal households and chiefdoms. Indeed, the South African government waved through an extra two million rand (\u00a3110,600) just last month, to help him get to the end of the financial year. What's more, his allowance looks set to rise to R63million (\u00a33.5million) a year by 2017. And none of this takes into account the amount the South African taxpayer is having to shoulder thanks to the inflammatory speech he gave in March. 'We ask the foreign nationals to pack their belongings and go back to their countries,' he said during the speech in Durban. King Zwelithini has blamed bad reporting for his alleged hate speech, yet his attempt to call for calm this week contained a clear, but rather chilling hint at the power the firebrand believes he wields over his predominantly impoverished, young followers. He told a crowd of 10,000 that if he had really ordered people to be killed 'this country would be reduced to ashes'. Even so, the South African government has been forced to declare 'an emergency' over the issue, ordering troops onto the streets of its most volatile townships where disaffected locals have been ransacking shacks in search of migrants they accuse of stealing job and business opportunities. At least 7,000 foreigners are sheltering in camps for their safety and more than 900 have fled, including to Zimbabwe where despot Robert Mugabe's government has likened the monarch's alleged remarks to those made in the run up to the genocide in Rwanda 20 years ago. Outcast: There are about 7,000 foreigners sheltering in special camps in Durban and Johannesburg .\n"]}

Reinventing himself as Celtic\u2019s top scorer, the front-page headlines are also less evident. If no one imagines he now spends his days train-spotting, the nights seem a little quieter than they once were. Leigh Griffiths celebrates scoring his third goal of the afternoon against Dundee United on Sunday . Hat-trick hero Griffiths takes the ball home following his heroics against Dundee at Tannadice Park . The 24-year-old (left) embraces his manager Ronny Deila after Sunday's convincing win . \u2018Leigh used to put himself around in the Leith area,\u2019 says Tam Currie, his former coach at boys club Leith Athletic. \u2018Not that he was doing anything off limits. \u2018But I\u2019ve not spoken to him in a good while. Before you would see quite a bit of him round here. But we don\u2019t see nearly as much of him now as we used to.\u2019 It may be a conscious thing. Google the words \u2018Leigh Griffiths and controversy\u2019 in the same search and there are more answers than pubs on Leith Walk. In football people talk and older, wiser colleagues and managers whispered of a player with a reputation for being unmanagable. \u2018There was never any doubt about the boy\u2019s ability,\u2019 says former Dundee manager Gordon Chisholm. \u2018It was the off-field stuff that concerned you. He was a young boy when I had him. He was quiet, withdrawn at times, and wasn\u2019 t exactly the life and soul of the dressing room. \u2018He kept himself to himself - but he couldn\u2019t get back to Edinburgh quick enough. \u2018That seemed to be the case any time he got a day off. Any spare time and he wanted back to Leith to be with his mates, which probably wasn\u2019t a good thing. 'I\u2019m not sure he was doing the right kind of things. I\u2019m sure he is now being guided by the Celtic management team.\u2019 It has taken time, work and effort to get to a point where Griffiths can now boast 14 goals in his last 17 games. Griffiths celebrated his hat-trick with a trophy as he became Celtic's top scorer . Griffiths caused a stir when he first arrived at Hibernian but proved to be a fans favourite in the end . Griffiths celebrates scoring the winning goal for Hibs in the Scottish Cup semi-final in April 2013 . As a child, he stood out in Edinburgh amateur football. But concerns about the impact of his formative years on the company he kept prompted Hibs, his boyhood idols, to reject his talents. \u2018It\u2019s well known he could be a feisty character,\u2019 recalls Tam Currie, a Leith Athletic committee member. \u2018I go back with Leigh to when he was 12 and he was a lad who had to be looked after. \u2018He came from a split family and you take on the role of social worker in that situation. But he was no different from the others in that regard. \u2018He was like any other young lad. He had his troubles with different folk and what not.\u2019 \u2018Troubles with different folk\u2019 is a polite way of summing up his career. Boldly, Neil Lennon took a gamble on signing him for \u00a3900,000 in January 2014. Celtic supporters were underwhelmed. Griffiths had accumulated yet more front-page cuttings from while on loan at Hibernian from Wolverhampton Wanderers following a racism row on social media. The doubts over his perceived shortcomings as a human being were amplified when he returned to Leith \u2013 where else? \u2013 to attend an Edinburgh derby as a Hibs fan. He was in a pub where offensive chants about Hearts and former Tynecastle attacker Rudi Skacel were filmed and posted on the internet. In October, he will stand trial on offensive behaviour at football. When the legal action is concluded one way or the other the SFA will revisit charges of bringing the game into disrepute. Griffiths was Wolves leading goalscorer in January of last year, scoring 13 goals in all . That attracted interest from Celtic though, with the Scottish striker penning a four-year deal with the Bhoys . The potential for embarrassment to Celtic is apparent and, perhaps for that reason, Lennon\u2019s successor, Ronny Deila, appeared to make a judgement the player wasn\u2019t worth the hassle. He was no one\u2019s definition of a Deila 24-hour athlete. Yet the Norwegian\u2019s attitudes to Griffiths began to soften when the player opted to drive three hours to play for Celtic\u2019s development team against Sunderland of his own accord. Within days he was back in the first team, scoring in a 2-1 defeat to Dundee United at Tannadice. In the five months since, he has usurped John Guidetti in the starting XI and is now regarded as Deila\u2019s most potent attacker. \u2018He looks as if he has matured as a player,\u2019 adds Chisholm, now a scout with Sunderland. \u2018He never wanted to be an out-and-out striker when I had him at Dundee. He always drifted out into wide areas. \u2018He still does that, but I think he has improved. His hold-up play and movement is better. \u2018He is playing with good quality players, getting better service and I am hopeful he has turned a corner now.\u2019 Bolton and Hibs wanted Griffiths on loan in the last window. The court case notwithstanding, however, his No 28 Celtic shirt looks a better fit now than it did even three months ago. \u2018He is silencing a few critics now,\u2019 says his former Leith coach Currie, with Griffiths having grabbed his second hat-trick of the season against Dundee United on Sunday. \u2018The Celtic supporters didn\u2019t fancy him much. There were certainly a few doubters there. \u2018People here in this neck of woods was hoping he would end up back at Hibs on loan. \u2018I\u2019m delighted for him it didn\u2019t come to that because I don\u2019t think it would have been a good move for his career. \u2018To be honest, I would take him over Steven Fletcher every time. \u2018He is a better striker. I used to see Fletcher a lot when he played for Hibs and, all round, Leigh is a better player. \u2018I read he still has a trial to go through for the pub incident - but he knows now he has to be on his best behaviour. You have to be to be a Celtic player. \u2018I\u2019ll tell him that if I see him again in Leith. But it looks to me now like he has turned the corner.\u2019\n"]}

Under the pact, no public holiday is triggered when\u00a0Anzac Day falls on a Saturday, as it does this year. The agreement was designed to provide uniformity of public holidays across the nation. That makes Anzac Day the exception when it comes to public holidays. If Easter, Christmas, Australia Day, the Queen's Birthday or Labour Day fall on a weekend, a holiday is granted on a weekday. Scroll down for video . Bosses in some states have been warned to expect a rise in employees calling in sick this Monday due to the lack of an Anzac Day public holiday . But the rules do not apply to everyone, it seems. Western Australia and some public servants in Canberra have decided to go it alone and will get Monday off. The head of the Immgration Department declared Monday a public holiday for 8,500 staff, but other departments such as the Australian Taxation Office and Defence will have to turn up to work. For the rest of the country, it's back to work on Monday. The decision not to grant the holiday has been condemned by some groups and human resources expert Paul Dundon warned there would be a big jump in employees calling in sick because they feel 'entitled' to the day off, reports\u00a0Courier Mail. 'Employees will feel aggrieved by not having a day off, Australians have an entitlement mentality,' said Mr Dundon, the boss of Direct Health Solutions. 'They're missing out and people want their fair share.' Mr Dundon said bosses should expect a 20 per cent-25 per cent rise in absenteeism on Monday 27. In turn, some businesses have notified staff that if they they fake a sick day, they risk losing their job. In Queensland alone, losses to businesses are estimated at more than $7.5 million if an expected 20,000 workers call in sick. The anniversary of the landing on Gallipoli has fallen on a Saturday this year, meaning all states but WA will miss out on holiday on Monday . Australian state governments came together for a Council of Australian Governments meeting in 1993 to try and make public holidays consistent across the nation. The reason was to avoid 'costs and disruption for business' that occurred when every state had different laws. The states agreed that when Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year\u2019s Day fell on a weekend, a public holiday the next working day would be triggered. It was decided that a public holiday for Anzac Day would only be triggered if it fell on a Monday . Good Friday, Easter Saturday and Easter Monday would continue to be observed on the days set according to tradition across the nation. In NSW, the Greens called on Premier Mike Baird to give workers Monday off, claiming the government has the power to grant an additional holiday under the Public Holidays Act. But NSW Business Chamber chief officer Stephen Cartwright told The\u00a0Sydney Morning Herald\u00a0there is no need for another holiday. 'Anzac Day is a very special day for Australians as it commemorates the landings at Gallipoli on April 25, 1915, and we rightly pause and take time to reflect on that day, whatever day of the week it happens to fall on each year,' he said. Punters playing traditional Australian Anzac Day gambling game two-up: NSW Business Chamber officer Stephen Cartwright said there is no need for an additional holiday on for Anzac Day .

A selection of 36 sweets - including liquorice sticks, cola bottles, jelly beans and gummy bears - are on sale, all guaranteed to be free of animal products or alcohol-based ingredients. The 10 stores trialling the scheme include Blackburn, Bolton, Preston, Bradford, West Bromwich, Birmingham, Leamington Spa and three in London. Morrisons supermarket has brought in halal-only pick and mix counters to cater for Muslim customers. Two-year-old Faizaan Ali (right) was among the first to sample the sweets in the chain's Blackburn store. The company, which has over 500 stores around the UK, has chosen the locations according to the make-up of their local communities. John Brooksbank, store general manager of Morrisons in Blackburn, said: 'Many customers have asked us about Halal sweets, so we have designed and introduced a new range. 'We are the first big supermarket in the UK to do this. It's a large range so we hope that it will provide a sweet treat for every taste. 'We would consider introducing the halal sweets range at other stores, should there be a demand. 'Yummys, the brand available, is a recognised Halal confectionery brand, which we are also selling in single bags in our world food aisle.' The supermarket has been praised by Muslim figures after announcing the move. Husnaa Ali, nine, tucks in to the treats at one of 10 stores around Britain chosen to trial the new scheme . The supermarket says it has brought in the idea in response to demand from customers in certain areas . Salim Mulla, chairman of the halal sub-committee at the Lancashire Council of Mosques, said: 'I think there are quite a few manufacturers who sell halal sweets but this is the first major supermarket to sell halal confectionery. I really welcome that. Halal  involves specific methods of killing animals which adhere to Islamic laws. Livestock or poultry must be slaughtered by cutting the jugular vein and carotid artery while the animal is alive and healthy. The blood is then drained from the carcass, while a Muslim recites a dedication. Views differ over whether the animal can be stunned before being killed. Halal sweets include only gelatin from halal slaughtered animals and do not contain any other animal-derived ingredients from non-halal animals. 'It is definitely something the Council of Mosques would support. Sweets are very popular with the Muslim community. I think the pick and mix will do really well.' Until now, Muslims have had to look at the ingredients to see if the sweets are suitable to eat as some contain animal products which are not halal. Abdul Hamid Qureshi, chairman of the Lancashire Council of Mosques, added: 'More and more supermarkets are introducing halal products to meet the needs of the customers, but this is the first halal pick and mix I have heard of. 'There will be financial reasons behind it. Businesses will not just sell products for social needs. 'Chains such as KFC have started offering Halal products to attract a new, younger audience and a larger demographic.'

The official number was issued to Hernandez as he started the rest of his life in jail, at Cedar Junction state prison in Massachusetts. He was being moved to the maximum security Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center near Shirley today. Hernandez is being held separately from other prisoners and is on suicide watch. He is now equipped with green prison scrubs and his tattoos are being examined for gang affiliations. It can also be disclosed that he was hooked on 'angel dust', a drug known to cause users to experience violent outbursts and paranoia. The former New England Patriots star smoked the hallucination-inducing drug in marijuana cigarettes that are known as 'killer joints' in the world of drugs. Sources said the brute, found guilty of murdering Odin Lloyd, was using the dangerous drug for at least a year before the victim was shot dead. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . The beginning of the rest of his life: Aaron Hernandez was taken to the MCI Cedar Junction prison in Walpole, Massachusetts on Wednesday after he was sentenced to life in prison without parole for the 2013 murder of Odin Lloyd. Hernandez circled in red, arriving at the 700-inmate prison . Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left).He will no longer be No 81 having been given his prison number: W106228. A man who knew Hernandez and asked not to be identified, said: 'He was regularly high or out of his mind on Angel Dust. 'People who were in his circles knew about it and we would talk about how it turned him into a punk. He was consistently aggressive, arrogant and unpleasant. 'His dope man would bring it to his house and he would roll it in with some weed and smoke it with his friends. 'He got so full of himself that he sometimes stopped caring if people saw him doing it and he would be told to go outside because restaurant owners were worried about their licenses. 'Some of my friends do security for high profile sports people and celebs and I was invited to a party by one. Hernandez was there and throwing his weight around. 'When I said 'Hi' to him, he looked me up and down like I was a piece of s***. 'He just ignored me like I shouldn't have been there. 'I guess he was a d**head before because all that fame and money went to his head. But the drugs made him turn out to be a monster. Few people liked him. They just went with everything to keep him under control.' Hernandez was a heavy drinker and would often down cocktails and champagne on nights out with his hangers on, picking up large bar bills and doing his best to impress women with his celebrity status. His jury heard that on the night of the murder he smoked marijuana and he was caught on camera dancing at a gas station while filling up his rental car after he smoked the drug . Stately: Before his arrest, Hernandez lived in a $1.3million mansion in North Attleborough, Massachusetts . Moving day: Prison life is a far cry from Herandez cushy life in North Attleborough.

Angel dust is also known as PCP and is a white crystalline powder that can also be dissolved in alcoholic drinks. It is also available in a variety of tablets, capsules, and users snort the colored powders as well as insert them into reefers with hash or dope. Doctors say the effects are that users feel detached, distant, and estranged from their surroundings. They experience hallucinations, severe mood disorders, and amnesia and outbreaks of violent behavior. Experts say PCP is addictive and one of the long lasting effects can be that users become violent or suicidal. Angel dust has been called 'devil dust' by those who have seen the violent outbursts of users and the manner in which it transforms them. The US Department of Justice's Drug Enforcement Administration says Angel Dust normally sells on the streets in powder, crystal, tablet, capsule, and liquid forms frpm $5 a tablet to $300 per ounce. Officials said users also referred to as Supergrass, Boat, Tic Tac, Zoom and, Shermans . Shayanna Jenkins, the mother of his two-year-old daughter, told the Lloyd murder trial that Hernandez smoked drugs on a daily basis. Hernandez showed signs of the effects with his brooding behavior in the months leading up to the Lloyd murder and is also accused in another murder case. Hernandez is charged in a 2012 double killing in Boston, accused in the drive-by shooting of two men he felt disrespected him at a nightclub. Victim: Odin Lloyd, who was murdered by Aaron Hernandez, resulting in the New England Patriots star receiving a whole-life sentence . Former Pats player Hernandez can be seen displaying his hip-hop moves as his rental car fills with gas, earlier that evening he had ran up a $243 bar tab and smoked marijuana . Having a high feeling of self worth is a classic symptom developed by users of the deadly drug. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to two counts of murder in the second case. He is charged with murdering Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado after an encounter at the nightclub called Cure. Daniel de Abreu is said to have accidentally bumped into the footballer at a nightclub, spilling Hernandez's drink. Hernandez told a friend he thought the man was 'trying' him, and surveillance video outside the club showed Hernandez pacing back and forth while his friend tried to calm him down. But he is accused of following them in a silver SUV and shooting them in their car at a stop light later that evening. The NFL waill now have to investigate how a heavy drug using sports star could have avoided rigorous testing designed to weed out drug cheats. They will have to consider whether the fallen star may have had a supply of masking agents which can be bought over the counter or he stayed clean long enough each summer to pass pre-season tests and then fell off the wagon without fear of being caught. Either finding will prompt calls for more rigorous testing of NFL players for illicit substances.\n"]}

But now they may have to make room for an addition to Shakespeare's famous oeuvre. New research indicates that \"Double Falsehood,\" a play first published in 1728 by Lewis Theobald, was actually written more than a century earlier by Shakespeare himself with help from his friend John Fletcher. The findings were published this week by two scholars who used computer software to analyze the writings of the three men and compare it with the language of the \"newer\" play. \"The match between the 'Double Falsehood' play and Shakespeare was a landslide. It was shockingly clear,\" said Ryan L. Boyd, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin. The study, co-authored by Boyd and UT colleague James W. Pennebaker, was published in the journal Psychological Science. \"There's very little wiggle room to interpret the numbers any differently.\" Boyd said he and Pennebaker analyzed 33 plays by Shakespeare, nine by Fletcher and 12 by Theobald to create a \"psychological signature\" of each author based on word choices, phrase patterns and other factors. They compared those profiles to the language in \"Double Falsehood\" and determined that the play's first half was almost entirely written by Shakespeare, though the second half appeared to be split evenly between Shakespeare and Fletcher. Only tiny traces of Theobald's signature were found. \"We're certainly not suggesting that Theobald didn't make edits,\" Boyd told CNN. \"But he clearly did not write it.\" \"Double Falsehood,\" also known as \"The Distressed Lovers,\" is based on the \"Cardenio\" section of Don Quixote, the classic 17th-century novel by Miguel de Cervantes. Set in Spain, the play revolves around the romantic entanglements of two brothers: one virtuous, one sinful. Theobald said he based the play on three original manuscripts he had discovered, all of them written by Shakespeare. But many scholars have long dismissed the play as a fake, suspecting that Theobald tried to pass the Bard's work off as his own. Shakespeare, who died in 1616, wrote most of his published plays between 1590 and 1612. British publishers Arden Shakespeare published \"Double Falsehood\" in 2010 -- for the first time in 250 years -- amid renewed claims by experts that it was Shakespeare's work. But the new study by Boyd and Pennebaker, the first to analyze the writings from a psychological perspective, may settle the matter once and for all. Shakespearean scholar Brean Hammond, professor of modern English literature at Nottingham University in the UK, praised the Texas study for its scientific approach. Hammond said Boyd and Pennebaker \"have got no dogs in the fight. They're not literary scholars, (so) their work could be seen as more objective than some of the literary studies.\" Hammond studied \"Double Falsehood's\" authorship from a literary perspective five years ago and found Shakespeare's DNA evident in the play. But he doubts the new research will put the matter entirely to rest. \"Those people who don't believe the play was written by Shakespeare aren't going to just lay down and die,\" he said.\n"]}

Now her brother Stephen Robinson, 44, from Wirral, Merseyside, is speaking for the first time since his sister's murder, to warn other women to be careful when looking for love online. The father-of-seven said: 'She was a lonely heart just wanting love. That animal preyed on her caring nature.' Sharon Winters, pictured here with her brother Stephen Robinson, was looking for her soulmate online . Kevin Hawke has been jailed for 17 and a half years for murdering Sharon  in a frenzied attack triggered by an argument over what to watch on the television . Mr Robinson told how his 39-year-old sister suffered more than 90 injuries after  Hawke stabbed her in the liver, spleen, lungs and heart with a four-and-a-half inch knife. He said that the vicious attack was triggered by a row over what to watch on the television. Afterwards, the 33-year-old killer, who had drunk 15 pints and a bottle of vodka over the course of the day, had a beer before calling the police. Hawke was jailed for a minimum of 17-and-a-half years after he admitted the murder in July last year. Liverpool Crown Court was told Hawke, of no fixed abode, moved into Ms Winters' house after just one date, and started being very controlling with her. Mrs Winters suffered from depression and had learning difficulties and\u00a0Mr Robinson said: 'I still can't believe someone would want to hurt my poor, defenseless sister in such a horrific manner.' Devoted aunt Sharon is pictured here with her niece Ellie, Stephen's daughter . He had begged her to end the relationship after hearing that Hawke would 'push his sister around'. But Ms Winters told her brother that she was 'just desperate to be loved' and stopped speaking to him. Mr Robinson said: 'She continued her relationship with that monster.' Just three days later, on July 13, 2014, police found Ms Winters dead in her flat in Liverpool. He is now determined that his sister's death will not in vain and is appealing for women in violent relationships to seek help, and be cautious when online dating. 'Sharon was the kindest, most loving sister. All she wanted to do was find her soulmate,' he said. 'She wore her heart on her sleeve. She was kind and caring - a lovely woman.' Ms Winters, who was unable to work due to depression, started going on dating websites in 2013. Father-of-seven Mr Robinson disapproved, fearing that men were taking advantage of his susceptible younger sister. He said: 'I used to check up on her all the time, I was incredibly protective. Sharon Winters was lonely and felt that Kevin Hawke was the only man who wanted her; Sharon, pictured with her mother Ann, had very low self-esteem, says her brother Stephen . 'One day when I was taking her over some shopping, I noticed she was looking brighter, and she told me she'd met someone online. 'She showed me their messages to one another and I was horrified. They were very sexual and he'd even sent her pictures of his privates. 'I feared he was just after one thing, and told her as much. She said that chatting to men online made her feel good about herself. 'She got frustrated by my disapproval, so I dropped the subject. I just begged her to meet these dates in busy places.' However, Ms Winters would often invite men she met online back to her home, meeting them there face-to-face for the first time. Mr Robinson said: 'For all her amazing qualities, my sister lacked common sense. She'd been bullied throughout childhood and felt like she was worthless, that she was unlovable. 'My wife Helen and I tried to build up her self-esteem, and our children loved spending time with their aunty. Stephen is trying to raise awareness of the dangers of online dating after his sister lost her life at the hands of a man she met on the internet . Stephen Robinson describes his sister as a 'lonely heart who just wanted love' 'But at the end of the day she just wanted someone she could share her life with.' Ms Winters thought she'd found that someone when she met Hawke, a chef, on a dating website. Mr Robinson said: 'From the off she was smitten. She called me up after meeting him for the first time, saying it was love and that he was moving in. 'I was concerned, but didn't say anything to Sharon. I knew it would upset her. Instead my wife and I arranged a dinner with the new couple, only Kevin didn't show. 'We rescheduled for the next day and the same thing happened again. By now I was also hearing rumours that Kevin was being aggressive towards Sharon, so I pleaded with her to end it. 'All she said was, \"no one else wants me'\", and it was heartbreaking to hear.' Mr Robinson's pleas fell on deaf ears, and Ms Winters stopped talking to her brother. It would be the last time they'd ever speak. He said: 'We had a bit of an argument about it, and three days later I called her to apologise. 'She didn't pick up her phone, which was odd, so I decided to head over to see her. I quickly checked the football scores before I left.' As Mr Robinson checked his local news website, he also saw a news story so devastating it would change his life forever. He saw a picture of his sister's home with the headline: 'A 39-year-old woman has been found dead in her flat.' He said: 'I felt sick to my stomach. I called the police who told me the news, Sharon was dead. 'I knew immediately who had killed her. We were eventually told Kevin Hawke had called the police after killing my sister, and had been charged with her murder. 'As we waited for the trial I planned Sharon's funeral. We had a butterfly theme as they were Sharon's favourite \u2013 delicate and beautiful, just like her.' During the trial at Liverpool Crown Court Mr Robinson heard how the couple had been rowing over what to watch on TV. An alcoholic, Hawke had drunk 15 pints of lager and a bottle of vodka. Stephen, pictured here with his daughters Sophie (left) and Ellie, on a trip to Sea World, begged Sharon to meet online dates in a busy public place rather than at her house . Mr Robinson said: 'It was horrendous to listen to. Apparently Sharon had begged for her life and held her hands up to protect herself. If only I'd been there. 'He was savage, her injuries were unbelievable. He'd even ripped through her ribcage. 'When the judge sentenced him to life in prison it was justice of sorts, but all I really want is my beloved sister back. 'After the case we went to get Sharon's belongings, and you could still see blood on the walls even through the flat had been cleaned. It must have been a bloodbath.' Now Mr Robinson is trying to raise awareness about domestic violence as well as letting women know the dangers of online dating. 'I hope by telling Sharon's story, people will be more wary about who they are chatting to online and make sure, if they do meet up, it's in a busy public place. 'Kevin was aggressive towards Sharon before he killed her, and I wish she'd gone for help. 'Instead my poor sister suffered in silence, with tragic consequences.'\n"]}

He was later charged with multiple manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and aiding illegal immigration.

Catania prosecutor Giovanni Salvi's office stressed that none of the crew aboard the Portuguese-flagged King Jacob is under investigation in the disaster. He said the crew members did their job in coming to the rescue of a ship in distress and that their activities 'in no way contributed to the deadly event.' Meanwhile, the survivors were brought to a migrant holding center in Catania and were 'very tired, very shocked, silent,' according to Flavio Di Giacomo of the International Organization for Migration. Most of the survivors and the victims appear to have been young men but there were also several children aged between 10 and 12, she added.

They told yesterday how women and children died 'like rats in a cage' after being locked into the boat's hold by callous traffickers in Libya. Some resorted to clinging to their floating corpses until Italian and Maltese coastguards came to rescue them in the dead of the night. The coast guard, meanwhile, reported that it saved some 638 migrants in six different rescue operations on Monday alone. On Tuesday, a further 446 people were rescued from a leaking migrant ship about 80 miles (130 kilometers) south of the Calabrian coast. At talks in Luxembourg on Monday, EU ministers agreed on a 10-point plan to double the resources available to maritime border patrol mission Triton and further measures will be discussed at a summit of EU leaders on Thursday.

Critics say Triton is woefully inadequate and are demanding the restoration of a much bigger Italian operation suspended last year because of cost constraints. The survivors, who hailed from Mali, Gambia, Senegal, Somalia, Eritrea and Bangladesh, were all recovering Tuesday at holding centres near Catania on Sicily's eastern coast. Sunday's disaster was the worst in a series of migrant shipwrecks that have claimed more than 1,700 lives this year - 30 times higher than the same period in 2014 - and nearly 5,000 since the start of last year. In that time nearly 200,000 migrants have made it to Italy, mostly after being rescued at sea by the Italian navy and coastguard. Italian officials believe there could be up to one million more would-be immigrants to Europe waiting to board boats in conflict-torn Libya. Many of them are refugees from Syria's civil war or persecution in places like Eritrea. Others are seeking to escape poverty and hunger in Africa and south Asia and secure a better future in Europe. Meanwhile,\u00a0Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott urged the EU to introduce tough measures to stop migrants attempting to make the perilous sea voyage from North Africa to Europe. Mr Abbott, whose conservative government introduced a military-led operation to turn back boats carrying asylum-seekers before they reach Australia, said it was the only way to stop deaths.

Haunted: Surviving immigrants who escaped the boat that capsized in the Mediterranean Sea killing up to 900 people appear deep in thought as they arrive in the Sicilian port city of Catania this morning . While Mr Abbott's controversial policy has proved successful, with the nation going nearly 18 months with virtually no asylum-seeker boat arrivals and no reported deaths at sea, human rights advocates say it violates Australia's international obligations. His comments came as EU foreign and interior ministers met in Luxembourg to discuss ways to stem the flood of people trying to reach Europe. Outlining his views on preventing the deaths of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, Mr Abbott told reporters: 'We have got hundreds, maybe thousands of people drowning in the attempts to get from Africa to Europe.' The 'only way you can stop the deaths is in fact to stop the boats', he added. Yesterday, the Maltese Prime Minister declared a crisis, calling for EU countries to reinstate rescue operations. He warned: 'A time will come when Europe will be judged harshly for its inaction when it turned a blind eye to genocide.

The 30-year-old lingerie model and animal rights activist from Los Angeles had come under fire during her pregnancy for posting a string of sexy selfies showing off her seemingly rock-hard abs. But James Hunter was born at a healthy eight pounds and seven ounces earlier this week, putting paid to Sarah's critics. Scroll down for video . Underwear model and animal rights activist Sarah Stage shared this adorable picture of her newborn baby James Hunter on Instagram . Sarah Stage took her last pregnancy selfie (pictured) on Monday, writing: 'Still waiting'. \u00a0The 30-year-old gave birth James the next day . Sarah shared the adorable pictures to her Instagram page. One, which shows a close up of her son's face, said: 'Love at first sight #jameshunter.' While the first ever picture of James featured the newborn in an adorable fox outfit. Sarah commented on the photo: 'James Hunter (4/14/15) 8.7lbs/22 inches of HEALTHY baby! 'Thank you for the positive support throughout my journey... It's just beginning!!! #JamesHunter #Healthy' During her pregnancy many people commented that they felt Sarah's unusually trim figure could be damaging to her unborn child, but it seems their fears were unfounded. Sarah posted this adorable picture of James to her Instagram commenting that it was 'love at first sight' Sarah confirmed her happy news to E!\u00a0revealing that her baby boy was  22 inches long at the time of his birth, adding: 'He's a big healthy boy and he got an APGAR score of eight to nine.' An APGAR score, which stands for Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity, Respiration, is a quick method for assessing the health of a newborn, with scores of seven or above being considered normal. Sarah famously documented her changing figure via her Instagram\u00a0page throughout her pregnancy, earning herself a huge number of fans - as well as a fair share of critics - in the process. Although the now mother came under fire last month as more and more critics spoke out against toned figure their comments never stopped the model from sharing numerous photos of her tight abs with her 1.6 million Instagram followers. In this gorgeous snap James is seen sleeping in a giraffe costume . On Tuesday Sarah shared a photo of two In-N-Out burgers, writing, 'Cravings,' although its not clear as to whether or not she enjoyed the meal before or after she gave birth. The lingerie-clad model snapped her last pregnancy selfie on Monday, which she captioned: 'Still waiting #9months [sic].' The snapshot of her in a black bra and thong\u00a0underwear has been liked over40,000 times since it was posted, and has earned nearly 4,000 comments. And Sarah, who is of European and Costa Rican descent, took to Instagram last week to share a photo of growing belly during the last weeks of her of pregnancy, writing: '10 days until we meet #BabyJames.' But Sarah didn't just receive harsh comments. Many women noted that they found Sarah's pregnancy body to be motivation to work out and live a healthy lifestyle. Sarah struck various poses for these selfies of herself in her underwear which she posted throughout her pregnancy . Haters gonna hate: Sarah, who came under fire for her being tiny and toned throughout her pregnancy, told her critics to unfollow her if they have a problem with her pictures . Pregnant model Sarah Stage snapped this photo of herself flaunting her barely-there baby bump 10 days before she was supposed to give birth to her son . 'I'm completely inspired to go to the gym first thing in the morning. You look absolutely gorgeous @sarahstage #amazing [sic],' one fan wrote. 'You look absolutely lovely. Hats off to you for being fit and taking care of yourself!' another added. 'If I ever have children, I'm inspired by you to treat my pregnancy the very same way. I'm sure James will be amazing! Congratulations.' Others compared their figures to Sarah's pregnancy body, with one woman writing: '10 days before giving birth?! Lord Jesus help us all! I look like this after dinner [sic].' 'I look like that after a good meal or two,' someone else commented. Meanwhile, some people suggested that her son would be as tiny as she is - although it has since been proved that their fears about the young boy's size were unfounded. Sarah and her friend compared their growing bellies for this playful picture . Sarah shared this adorable photo of matching father and son Timberland boots . 'Baby James will come out the size of her phone case,' one person commented, referencing the model's bear-shaped cell phone cover. When she's not sharing lingerie selfies, the new mother regularly shared pictures of her son's nursery and his future wardrobe. Last week, Sarah shared an adorable photo of matching father and baby sized Timberland boots, writing: 'Daddy & baby shoe game [sic].' And despite her critics, Sarah refused to hide her then-eight-month pregnant body in maternity clothes. Sarah refused to wear baggy clothes during her pregnancy and instead opts for figure-hugging dresses like the one she is wearing in this picture . Sarah wore this sexy black dress on a 'date night' when she was 37 weeks pregnant, two weeks before James was born . She shunned baggy dresses and instead dressed her bump in fitted Lycra or nothing at all. The fitness fanatic loves hitting the gym and captures herself working out, as well as following a healthy diet of quinoa,spinach and chicken. Clearly not letting her growing baby bump get in the way of her career, Sarah continued to proudly model whilst carrying. Two weeks ago, she shared a sexy snapshot of herself in black underwear and responded to her haters. 'BTW If you don't like my pics then unfollow me,' she wrote. 'I'm excited, happy and enjoying every second of my pregnancy. Can't wait to meet James! #NFG #37weeks [sic].'\n"]}

Now a trickle of royal fans, some familiar faces among them, have begun arriving at the Lindo Wing ahead of the royal birth. But the  group, which includes well-known royal enthusiast Margaret Tyler, 71, could be in for a long wait as the Duchess of Cambridge's due date is more than a week away. Getting ready: Royal superfans Margaret Tyler and John Loughery outside the Lindo Wing . That, however, wasn't enough to dampen spirits with the group, all of whom had come prepared with Union flags, posing happily for the gathering Press pack. Joining Mrs Tyler was another familiar face - that of self-confessed royal 'superfan' John Loughery, 60, who camped out overnight ahead of the 2011 Royal Wedding and was the only member of the public to attend every day of the inquest into the death of Princess Diana in 2008. Mr Loughery, a former chef, said at the time he hoped to go down in history for the feat and told the BBC that he wouldn't be surprised 'if a portrait of me is hanging inside Kensington Palace in 100 years from now'. Equally serious about the Royal Family is Mrs Tyler, an avid collector of royal memorabilia who has amassed a trove worth more than \u00a310,000. Nearly there: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured last month, is due to give birth on the 25th April . Regular: John Loughery, 60, has been present for every major royal event of the last 10 years . Diana fan: His favourite was Princess Diana and he attended every day of the 2008 inquest into her death . Mrs Tyler, who gave birth to her son Andrew at the Lindo Wing, says she considers the royals to be part of her family and has been following their exploits for more than 40 years. Her collection of royal souvenirs, which includes a \u00a31,200 bust of Prince Charles, is so vast, it takes up four rooms in her small terraced home in London. Like Mr Loughery, Mrs Tyler was also at the Lindo Wing for the birth of Prince George and ended up spending six days waiting for him to arrive. 'I was there for six days,' she told a recent episode of BBC2 show Collectaholics. '[My son] Andrew was born at St. Mary's and I was only there for two days. 'I just wanted to feel close to them [William and Kate], I suppose. I spent the time meeting people, and chatting.I was convinced it was going to be a girl, but it wasn't.' She describes her collecting as a 'labour of love' and says every day is dominated by her royal obsession. Excited: Mr Loughery, from Wandsworth,  with Maria Scott and her daughter Amy Thompson from Newcastle . Pole position: Mrs Tyler surveys the scene outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in Paddington . Impressive collection: Mrs Tyler has filled four rooms of her small London home with memorabilia . Valuable: The collection is thought to be worth around \u00a310,000 and is a 'labour of love' 'There's loads of royal magazines that I read, so I get up at about 4.30am to keep up with it all,' she reveals. 'I'm retired but I don't think I've actually ever worked so hard in my life. It takes a lot of work [to maintain] but it's a labour of love.' The Duchess of Cambridge is due to give birth to her second child on the 25th April, although experts say royal watchers could be in for a long wait as second babies tend to come late. Nevertheless, preparations for the birth are well past the planning stages, with a media pen designed to hold the expected influx from around the world opening today. The police have also begun patrolling outside the Lindo Wing and have barred photographers from getting too close to the door. Although the Duchess herself is believed to be at Kensington Palace, her husband Prince William is working in Norfolk and is expected to be forced to make a two-hour hospital dash when his 33-year-old wife goes into labour.\n"]}

When your face is the charred remains of having nearly burned to death at the wheel of a Ferrari, why not throw caution to the wind or, in Shanghai\u2019s case, the smog?

Of course, not long after these words reach your breakfast tables in the shires, Rosberg may buck up and take pole, but it would be something of a surprise, not least to Lauda, if he did. \u2018Yes, Nico is definitely a little bit behind Lewis,\u2019 said the Austrian. \u2018He has to sort himself out. It is not anything I can talk to him about. I don\u2019t know why \u2014 he is not driving as well as he was.

It is more that his confidence seems to have been shaken, whereas it was so strong in the early and mid parts of last season. Then Hamilton put down the hammer, changing the dynamic for both men. At least Rosberg is not the watching neutral\u2019s only hope of a contest breaking out this season, after Ferrari shocked everyone by winning a fortnight ago. Nobody was ever more pleased to see Sebastian Vettel wagging his finger in celebration than fans whose own digits were poised over the television remotes\u2019 off-switches, so jaundiced were they by the prospect of Mercedes\u2019 seemingly endless hegemony.

Lauda, a long-time friend of Ecclestone, has no time for sentiment. \u2018Even if Ferrari winning makes Bernie happy, I will still be upset,\u2019 he said. \u2018The priority for me and Toto and Paddy (Lowe, the technical director) is to try to win every bloody race. It is our mission. Sebastian Vettel  looks on from the team garage during practice for the China Formula One Grand Prix .

It is not my responsibility to make the sport more interesting. My worry for us is that Ferrari won so early in the season. \u2018That gives them a lot of momentum. For an Italian team, momentum can be very important. \u2018The Italians are emotional and it works best for them when they have a blend of English, Germans and Italians. They have that now (James Allison, a British engineer is their technical director). Vettel is a four-time world champion and so is someone to look up to. They have a combination of everything.\u2019 Most observers thought Ferrari\u2019s win in Malaysia might be a one-off created by the absurdly hot weather.

{"question_id": 226, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Breakthrough?: Early tests carried out on cancer cells (like the one pictured) have shown survival rates in mice were boosted by more than 50 per cent . A new technique that effectively gives a personal treatment for cancer has been found by scientists. It harnesses the power of the body\u2019s immune system and targets it at tumours. Early experiments have demonstrated that the new method could revolutionise cancer care. Scientists have found a system of priming the body\u2019s immune system to recognise, attack and kill off cancerous cells in lung, skin and bowel tumours. The team which carried out the research found that early trials \u2018profoundly retarded\u2019 tumour growth in mice. Survival rates were boosted by more than 50 per cent, according to results published in the journal Nature last night. The scientists are now recruiting patients with skin cancer for the first clinical trial on humans. British experts said it is the most promising sign yet that \u2018personal\u2019 treatments may be effective in treating a wide range of cancers. Until now most cancer drugs have been designed according to the type of tumour they are attacking \u2013 a broad-brush approach in which the type of drug is selected depending on the body part in which the tumour is sited. But the new focus on personal cancer therapy instead aims to harness each individual\u2019s immune system and give it a boost depending on the genetic make-up of the tumour itself. The ground-breaking technique may provide a universal blueprint for vaccines that can target a wide range of human cancers. And it overcomes the problem of cancer presenting an ever-moving target that constantly evolves to evade the immune system. Scientists last night welcomed the German team\u2019s breakthrough. Professor Kevin Harrington, from the Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: \u2018This study provides the first evidence that we may be on the threshold of being able to produce individualised vaccines directed against specific mutations present in a patient\u2019s tumour. Advances: People with skin cancer are now being recruited for the first human trial . \u2018Rapid production of purpose-built vaccines appears possible and can now be tested in carefully designed clinical trials. \u2018As yet, this approach must be seen as experimental but it potentially represents a new way of harnessing the power of the immune system against cancer.\u2019 The scientists, led by Dr Ugur Sahin, of Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, identified tumour-specific mutations linked to the different cancers and showed that many of them could be recognised by the body\u2019s immune system. They then created vaccines based on the body\u2019s own RNA \u2013 a genetic messenger \u2013 which encouraged the immune system to direct itself towards the weakest part of the tumour. The treatment was shown to boost the body\u2019s T-cells, which detect, hunt down and destroy cancer cells. Of the mice treated, two-thirds were alive after 100 days. Of those that did not receive treatment all died within 65 days. When repeated vaccinations were administered, \u2018tumour growth was profoundly retarded\u2019, the authors wrote. Professor Peter Johnson, from the Cancer Research UK Centre at Southampton General Hospital, said: \u2018This technique provides the first evidence that it may be possible to direct the immune system to fight cancer using personalised vaccines.\u2019\n"]}
{"question_id": 227, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Decided? Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has spoken - and acted - in a way which suggests her strong supporting for legalizing same sex marriage . Ruth Bader Ginsburg has already made up her mind about gay marriage, a report has claimed, ahead of a landmark Supreme Court hearing which could legalize the practice nationwide. The famously liberal justice, who is 82, will be part of a decision which begins hearing arguments tomorrow on whether states are allowed to ban same-sex unions and refuse to recognize those made in other states. Ginsburg, who has sat on the court since 1993, has been unusually open about her opinions ahead of the cases. cutting against a long-held tradition of not speaking out in advance. The new report, Yahoo! Politics, cited interviews in which Ginsburg has referred to the American public becoming more accepting of gay rights in general - and has even officiated at same-sex ceremonies. Ahead of the first such ceremony, held in Washington, D.C., \u00a0in August 2013, she told the Washington Post\u00a0that she understood the symbolic implications of her involvement. She said the wedding, of her friend\u00a0Michael M. Kaiser, president of the Kennedy Center, to economist John Roberts, would 'be one more statement that people who love each other and want to live together should be able to enjoy the blessings and the strife in the marriage relationship.' She will get the chance to make her views known in the upcoming case of Obergefell v. Hodges, for which arguments will be heard from Tuesday and a decision is expected this summer. The case is being brought by James Obergefell, an Ohio man who married his husband in Maryland but was not allowed to name himself as spouse on his husband's death certificate in his home state. Currently 37 states allow gay marriage, as well as Washington, D.C. - but Ohio is one of 13 which has held out. Protests: Pictured are gay rights protesters camped out in front of the Supreme Court this weekend.\u00a0Obergefell v. Hodges will be heard from tomorrow . Votes: Ginsburg is one of four liberal-voting Supreme Court justices, though Anthony Kennedy (front row, second from right) has often sided with them on gay rights issues. Pictured above are all the Supreme Court Justices. On the front row (left to right) are Clarence Thomas, Antonin Scalia, John G. Roberts, Kennedy and Ginsburg. Behind them (also left to right) are\u00a0Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, Sameul Alito and Elena Kagan . The Supreme Court will determine whether the Constitution guarantees all citizens the right to same sex marriage, which could void all the remaining bans. And if it determines that recognizing gay marriage is still up to individual states, the court could also decide that states are obliged to recognize gay marriage performed elsewhere in the U.S. After a 2012 ruling, the federal government is already required to recognize gay marriage in states where they are allowed. The liberal wing's four justices are expected to vote in favor of gay marriage, and could be joined by the more conservative Anthony Kennedy, who has often sided with liberals on issues of personal freedom, which would provide the five votes necessary for a majority. In an interview with Bloomberg\u00a0earlier this year, Ginsburg insisted that 'it would not take a large adjustment' for Americans to accept gay marriage across the board, and that the country has become far more accepting. Gay marriage opponents have said that Ginsburg previous actions and public statements go so far as to make her unfit to hear the case. Battle: The case was prompted by James Obergefell, left, who wants the state of Ohio to recognize him as his husband's spouse on his death certificate. He is taking on Richard Hodges, right, who leads Ohio's department of health . Couple: Obergefell, left, married his husband John Arthur in Maryland shortly before his death - but has not been allowed to name himself as Arthur's spouse on his death certificate . Both the National Organization for Marriage and the American Family Association, which oppose gay marriage, have demanded that Ginsburg remove herself from the case because she officiated over the ceremony. They made the same demand of Justice Elena Kagan, another liberal justice, who has officiated a ceremony as well. If both justices were to agree it would leave the court two liberals down and unlikely to side with the legalization. However, according to legal scholars, neither has done anything wrong because the earlier court decision had already vindicated same-sex marriages in states which had legalized them. It has been speculated that Justice Kennedy could be the swing vote in this issue. A recent report by the\u00a0Associated Press\u00a0speculated that his professional links with a California law school dean who hired him in the 1950s could have embedded some early sympathies. The report, citing people who knew him when he taught at McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento, said that being mentored by Gordon Schaber, who never married and was widely thought to gay, could swing him towards favoring gay rights. Kennedy is likely, the report said, to eventually write the Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, which would follow several other written opinions expanding gay rights.\n"]}

Loeb\u00a0has filed a lawsuit in California in a bid to prevent the Modern Family actress from destroying\u00a0two cryopreserved female embryos created through IVF, according to\u00a0InTouch. Vergara\u2019s representatives declined to comment on the allegations when contacted by DailyMail.com on Wednesday. Court documents, filed under pseudonyms Jane and John Doe, detail how the couple fertilized embryos using her eggs and his sperm six months before their split in November 2013. Scroll down for video . Legal fight: A magazine claims Nick Loeb has filed a lawsuit against his ex-fiancee Sofia Vergara in a bid to prevent her from destroying two cryopreserved female embryos created through IVF, pictured here in 2011 . Loeb, 39, is seeking to ensure the female embryos are not destroyed, but Vergara has refused to 'agree to their preservation under all circumstances,' according to the legal papers. The lawsuit was first filed in August 2014 before it was refiled again on April 1 with updated information and after Loeb sought new legal representation. Another claim in the documents is that, previously, the pair twice had eggs implanted in a surrogate, but the procedure failed. Elsewhere in the lawsuit, it is claimed 42-year-old actress Vergara - who got engaged to True Blood hunk Joe Manganiello on Christmas Day after six months of dating - was 'physically and mentally abusive' to Loeb. Wrangle: The lawsuit has been filed under the pseudonyms John and Jane Doe . No directive: Ultimately, the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge, but it would be unlikely that Loeb would be able to use the embryos without Sofia's consent, according to a legal expert who spoke to InTouch . The documents state: 'She punched him in the face on two occasions, kicked him, and threw her phone at his head. She also routinely bullied him, calling him a \"loser,\" \"worthless\" and other degrading names.' In April 2013 Vergara - who has a 23-year-old son Manolo from her first marriage - spoke publicly about having frozen her eggs and her desire to have more children. She revealed that she and Loeb - who she dated on-off for almost four years - planned to use a surrogate on the account that she had thyroid cancer in 2000 and, as a result, had a lot of radiation. Complicated matter: In this page of the document it states Sofia and Nick were planning on using a gestational surrogate in 2012 to start a family and that Sofia had insisted on using a 44-year-old friend and emloyee . Arduous process: After the first two embryos failed to implant in the first surrogate the couple looked for another suitable candidate . Getting ugly: Page five of the document further details Sofia and Nick's disagreements over the usage and disposal of the embryos and also alleges Sofia was physically, emotionally and mentally abusive to him . InTouch has previously claimed that now Vergara and 38-year-old Manganiello have found a surrogate and plan to have children of their own. The actress recently told Vanity Fair magazine that while having another child would be 'weird', it something she might do if it made Joe happy. She told the magazine: 'My son, Manolo, is 23 years old, which is going to be really weird if I have another baby. But, you know, Joe wants babies and if it's going to make him super-happy, then...' The complicated legal wrangle with Loeb still stands, though. Moving on: The Modern Family actress is now engaged to Joe Manganiello and there are rumours the couple are planning to have children of their own via a surrogate . Other documentation obtained by InTouch which forms part of the lawsuit shows that Jane Doe (Vergara) asked that the embryos be destroyed in the event of her death, while Loeb refused to agree to this condition. No agreement was made between the couple about what would happen to any frozen eggs in the event they ended their relationship. Ultimately, the outcome will be at the discretion of a judge. However legal experts told InTouch that it would be unlikely that Loeb will be able to use the embryos without Sofia's consent.

Thames Valley Police believed they arrived in Calais, France, before travelling south down through Europe in a bid to flee to Syria. However, a Turkish official claimed today that the couple had been arrested in Ankara and are currently in custody with their four children - daughter Zoha, seven, and three sons Essa, four, Zakariva, two, and Yahya, one. Photos released by the Turkish government show Asif Malik (left) and his partner Sara Kiran (right) pushing prams for their young children. They have been arrested by police in Ankara as they tried to go to Syria . Asif Malik, 31, his partner Sara Kiran, 29, and their four young children have reportedly been arrested in Ankara, Turkey. The family of six have been missing from their home in Slough, Berkshire, since April 7 . The family, who were spotted on CCTV at Dover catching a ferry to France on April 8 (pictured), were not reported missing by their relatives until eight days later. Police fear they may have been trying to get to Syria . Malik, 31, who has fled the UK with his family, was pictured at a protest outside the Lebanese embassy in London in May last year holding a pro-ISIS poster. The large poster stated 'Stop Terrorism Against Sunnis' Earlier, British authorities had said that there was no suggestion the family was doing any fighting in Syria, and it was unclear whether they were sympathetic to members of the Islamic State group or Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. But earlier today, the Mail revealed how Malik was pictured waving a flag in support of ISIS at a demonstration in London last year. The photograph shows Malik - a member of the banned UK extremist group al-Mujahiroun - holding a pro-ISIS sign at a protest against the arrest of hate preacher Omar Bakri Muhammad in May last year. The picture, taken by extremism researcher Jacob Michelson, shows the 31-year-old standing outside the Lebanese embassy in London brandishing a poster which reads 'Islamic State Is Solution', with the first letter of each word highlighted to spell out 'ISIS'. Bakri, who led a number of hate groups in Britain before being kicked out of the UK, was arrested in Lebanon in May, and is believed still to be in detention there. Earlier today Ms Kiran's family made an emotional appeal directly to her, urging her to get in touch so that they know the family is safe. 'We would like to urge you, Sara and Asif, to make contact with us and let us know that you and the children are safe,' relatives said in a statement. 'Sara, we want to let you know that we love you - we miss you, Asif and the grandchildren. You are not in trouble, we are not angry or upset, and we just want you to return home safely.' Thames Valley Police said yesterday that the Malik family were last seen on Tuesday April 7 but were only reported missing to police last Thursday, April 16. Malik (left) and Dhar (right) are pictured at a protest outside outside Regent's Park Mosque in May last year . Asif Malik (left) and his partner Sara Kiran (right) disappeared from their home in Berkshire this month . Malik and Ms Kiran, who neighbours said usually wore the full Islamic veil, left home without mentioning any holiday or travel plans to family members, which a force spokesman said was 'entirely out of character for this family'. Police said the family boarded a ferry from Dover to Calais at 12.30am on Wednesday, April 8. Neighbours said the alarm was raised after at least one of their four children failed to attend school. Their grandmother was also seen looking for them and knocking on other doors in the modern block of flats where they lived, asking if anyone had seen the family. Neither Malik nor his partner have attempted to contact any family members or friends since, despite taking their mobile phones with them on the trip, police said. Police said the lack of contact led detectives to believe their reason for leaving Britain may not be legitimate. Deputy Chief Constable John Campbell said yesterday: 'Given the online rhetoric from the Islamic State encouraging people to travel to Syria, the direction of travel and concerns voiced by Asif's family, we are concerned the family may be seeking to travel to Syria.' Anjem Choudary confirmed yesterday that Malik had been a member of al-Mujahiroun, and described him as a 'champion for shariah' who regularly attended the group's events and demonstrations. The Malik family's last known address in Slough, Berkshire, was in the block of flats on the left of this image . Siddhartha Dhar posted this picture of himself with a gun and his newborn baby on Twitter shortly after arriving in Syria last year.\u00a0Dhar fled to Syria with his pregnant wife and three young children last year . Both Malik and Dhar are believed to be followers of notorious preacher Anjem Choudary (pictured above) Dhar - one of Choudary's top henchmen - fled to Syria with his pregnant wife and three young children last year while under investigation by Scotland Yard. He was one of nine men who were detained on September 25 last year on suspicion of encouraging terrorism and supporting al-Muhajiroun. Just hours after publicly declaring he had arrived in Syria, Dhar announced he had become a father to a baby boy who was a member of the latest generation of Islamist extremists. He wrote: 'Alhamdulillah, Allah blessed me with a healthy baby boy in the Islamic State. He is another great addition to the Islamic State. And he's definitely not British.' In a picture posted on Twitter at the time, Dhar was seen posing with an AK47 in one hand and his new-born baby in the other while standing in front of a mustard-coloured pickup truck, wearing a thick military style coat and boots. Two other followers of Choudary who have left Britain to join a terror group are Abu Rahin Aziz, from Luton, and former NHS surgeon Mirza Tariq Ali. Aziz skipped bail before he was handed a 36-week jail sentence in absence for attacking a football fan in London's West End, while Ali was arrested for repeatedly assaulting a bystander at a rally and was reported to have been killed while fighting with the Taliban last month.

In New York, for instance, there's a tendency to use the word 'so' for drama, such as 'I'm so totally over this.'

I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em - Florida . You are so in the Doghouse for that on - New York . Twitter can be a professional job anymore - Nebraska . Now researchers at Yale University have revealed these patterns by documenting the subtle differences in sentence structure across the US. Their interactive map allows you to click on a location and see common phrases for a region, as well as its source. While the map focuses on the US, it also has a small amount of data for the UK, with sentences such as 'yer lugs needs washed' used in Scotland and 'Ne mon nule don hum no good', in Aylesbury. 'Unlike variation in phonology (often referred to as accent) and in the lexicon (different words), variation in grammatical systems within English has for the most part not been systematically investigated,' says Larry Horn, professor of linguistics and philosophy at Yale University. 'This variation may be found among speakers who live in a certain geographical region, or who belong to a certain age group, or to a particular social or ethnic group,' he adds. During the past year, members of the project have been conducting nationwide surveys using an online crowdsourcing platform asking for people's judgment on sentences. The researchers were not interested in what is considered to be correct  grammar, but in what people do naturally. As well as the map, the team has also created a comprehensive guide that lists the different types of sentence structures used. One of the most interesting discoveries  are presentative sentences like 'Here's you a water bottle.' 'That sentence just floored me,' says postdoctoral associate Jim Wood, a Yale University lecturer in linguistics. 'It seemed very alien and different to me.' The overall pattern was clear; In the South people found that sentence to be completely normal, while in the North, it was almost unheard of. From 'here's you a piece of pizza' to 'this glass needs washed', every state has its own phrases that can seem odd to the rest of the world . 'It's a reason didn't nobody help him', is a common sentence structure used in San Jose, claims the study authors at Yale University . While the map focuses on the US, it also has a small amount of data for the UK, with sentences such as 'yer lugs needs washed' used in Scotland (left) and 'Ne mon nule don hum no good', in Aylesbury. And New York isn't the only region that uses 'so' to add emphasis to a sentence. Londoners also appear to have picked up the habit (right) 'It was pretty stunning, and it turns out you can do it with \"where\" as well. \"Where's me a screwdriver?\" or \"Where's me a place to eat around here?\"' he added. Other notable examples include \u2018Don\u2019t none of y\u2019all work as hard as I do\u2019 in Virginia; \u2018we all use night-crawlers anymore\u2019 in Iowa; and \u2018I ain't never had no trouble with none of 'em\u2019 in Florida. Meanwhile, people in New Haven sometimes use 'so don't I', such as in the sentence, 'he plays guitar, but so don't I'. Linguistics Professor Raffaella Zanuttini explained that there is also a social implication to this research. 'Often people are convinced that there is a right way of speaking a language and a wrong way of speaking that language. 'From the point of view of a linguist, that is really off the mark for many reasons,' she says. 'We linguists can see through this, because we have a more scientific approach to language,' says Zanuttini. 'We believe that creating an awareness of what we consider to be basic facts about language can have a positive social effect, by making people aware that they are expressing a negative evaluation of others.'

Many teenagers are tempted to try e-cigarettes, but few become regular users, scientists have discovered. In fact, they found most of those teens who do try e-cigarettes are also smokers. This suggests young people are not using the electronic alternatives to try and quit their habits - nor are they  getting hooked on them after initially trying them. Researchers examined data from two nationally representative surveys of primary and secondary schoolchildren from more than 150 schools across Wales. In all, 1,601 children aged 10 to 11 and 9,055 children aged 11 to 16 were quizzed about their use of e-cigarettes. Experts at Cardiff University found use of e-cigarettes at least once was more common than having smoked a conventional cigarette in all age groups, bar the oldest (15 to 16 year olds). Almost six per cent of 10 to 11 year olds had tried e-cigarettes, far more than had been tempted by tobacco (1.6 per cent). Meanwhile, 12 per cent of 11 to 16 year olds said they had used e-cigarettes, irrespective of gender, ethnic background, or family affluence. This is in contrast with the pattern seen in smokers, where all these factors come into play. The researchers said it suggests e-cigarettes may have a wider appeal across all sectors of the teenage population. The proportion of teens who used e-cigarettes, but who had never smoked, rose from 5 per cent among 10 to 11 year olds, to eight per cent among 15 to 16 year olds. But only 1.5 per cent of those aged 11 to 16 said they regularly used the electronic devices - defined as at least once a month. The researchers note their findings suggest 'e-cigarettes are unlikely to make a major, direct contribution to adolescent nicotine addiction at present'. They note the World Health Organisation recognise there is little evidence as to whether e-cigarettes may or may not act as a gateway to conventional smoking. The odds of regular e-cigarette use were 100 times higher among current weekly smokers than among non-smokers, and 50 times higher among those who had smoked cannabis . The strong link between current smoking and e-cigarette use suggests that teens are not using these products to help them quit smoking, the researchers said. They admit that a lack of consensus about what constitutes \u2018use\u2019 of an e-cigarette presents something of a challenge for research in this area, and suggest that further much longer term studies to include the generation of young people who have grown up with e-cigarettes are needed before firmer conclusions can be drawn. The Cardiff University study noted most of those teens who do try e-cigarettes are also smokers, suggesting they are not using the electronic alternatives to try and quit their habits . Professor Peter Hajek, director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit, at Queen Mary University of London, said: 'The results of this large survey tally with all other available data and the picture is consistently reassuring. 'E-cigarettes do not attract non-smokers.' Professor Paul Aveyard, at the University of Oxford, said: 'This study shows that teenagers do what teenagers do: they experiment with smoking and nowadays also with e-cigarettes. 'Consequently some people who have never tried tobacco cigarettes try e-cigarettes but only a few use them at least monthly, suggesting they are unattractive to people who do not smoke. 'About a fifth of regular smokers are using e-cigarettes, which is not a concern because e-cigarettes are less likely to harm users than are tobacco cigarettes. 'It does not show us anything about whether e-cigarettes help teenagers quit. It is hard to measure rare events but this survey was large enough to be sure that fewer than one in 200 never-smokers used an e-cigarette at least once a month.' The study was published in BMJ Open.\n"]}

The incident is difficult to comprehend as the collision was much more than just a minor skirmish on the tarmac at the busy Asian airport. The damage on the vehicle is clear, although it is unknown if the engine of the Boeing 777 jet was damaged or if anyone was injured. The bus ploughed into the engine of the Uzbekistan Airways Boeing 777 passenger jet . Tashkent is the largest international airport in Uzbekistan, and the busiest in Central Asia, so the crash will have more than likely delayed many passengers. The plane was believed to be an Uzbekistan Airways service, the national airline of the country, with its headquarters at Tashkent. MailOnline Travel has contacted Uzbekistan Airways and is awaiting comment. This kind of incident is unfortunately becoming more common. Ryanair passengers travelling to Edinburgh and Zadar, Croatia were delayed for hours after two of the budget airline\u2019s planes clipped wings at Dublin Airport back on April 1. Photos snapped by travellers show the tip of a winglet dangling by a thread after clipping the other plane - and it's the second time in six months two Ryanair planes have collided at Ireland's busiest airport.

Passengers escaped injury when the planes collided as they taxied to a runway shortly before 8am, but the incident caused disruption for hundreds of travellers. In October 2014 a Ryanair jet had its winglet torn off when it collided with another plane belonging to the budget carrier at Dublin Airport. The Boeing 737s heading to Edinburgh and Brussels were taxiing to a runway when they collided in darkness. In January this year a British Airways plane hit a hangar at Heathrow Airport, while being towed away for routine maintenance. As the Boeing 777-200 aircraft was being towed towards a hangar, someone misjudged the distance and the plane's wing clipped the wall of a nearby building.

The unnamed caller gave the operator a blow-by-blow account as he wandered behind Rafi Meitiv, 10, and his sister Dvora, 6, in Silver Spring on Sunday. The 7-minute call would reignite a controversy focused on those kids and their scientist parents, Danielle and Alexander Meitiv, who espouse the hands-off parenting style. The caller, who was out walking his dog in the suburb adjacent to Washington, DC, said he saw 'two kids that are unaccompanied, and they've been walking around for probably about 20 minutes by themselves.' Scene: The 911 call that reignited the 'free-range' parenting controversy for two Maryland parents has been released and reveals that\u00a0Rafi Meitiv, 10, and his sister Dvora, 6, were picked up by police while walking through this vicinity of the Washington, DC-adjacent suburb of Silver Spring on Sunday . The operator asked, 'Have you talked to them to see, you know, why are they just walking around by themselves?' 'No, no, they came up and asked to pet my dog, I let them, and that was it...I don't want to scare them,' he said. The man continued to tail the children, who eventually did become frightened when they realized they were being followed, until police arrived. Their parents Danielle and Alexander Meitiv have been cited multiple times for allowing their kids to roam free in their suburban neighborhood. But the Meitivs say authorities crossed a line over the weekend when they picked up Rafi and Dvora and held them nearly six hours without food before allowing them to reunite with their parents. Picked up: Officials seized Dvora, 6, (far left) and 10-year-old Rafi (left, blue hat) on Sunday in a Maryland park. The parents\u00a0Danielle and Alexander Meitiv (right) have vowed to sue authorities responsible for keeping them in custody for six hours . Picked up AGAIN: The Meitivs say they were left to panic for hours by CPS workers after their children--who they raise with a so-called 'free-range' approach--were picked up by police for the second time in two months while walking down the street alone . Attorney Matthew Dowd, of the firm Wiley Rein, is representing the Meitivs and on Tuesday sent a pointed letter regarding Sunday's events. Rein wrote: . 'The actions of Maryland CPS and Montgomery County Police violate the fundamental rights parents have in raising their children. 'This fundamental, constitutional right of parents cannot be infringed simply because certain governmental employees disagree with a parent's reasoned decision on how to raise his or her children.' The firm declined to say who the suit would be against, exactly, when asked by the Washington Post. However, the attorney has vowed to pursue 'all legal remedies' to protect the rights of the Maryland parents. The Meitivs made headlines just before Christmas when police found Rafi and Dvora walking the sidewalk on their own. 'Besides the policeman pulling up...no': Asked if he was scared during the hours-long ordeal Sunday, 10-year-old Rafi admitted he was, but not because he'd been left alone with his sister . Free-range parenting is the name given to a style of raising kids in opposition to so-called 'helicopter parenting'. 'Helicopter parents' are named for their habit of hovering over their offspring, micro-managing their lives in an attempt to keep them safe. However critics believe this creates under-confident, over-reliant children, while also causing the parents stress. Free-range parents advocate a more hands-off approach, where children are allowed to go out and experience the world on their own. Instead of constantly monitoring activities to make sure children are safe, the emphasis is put on adults assessing risk ahead of time, and equipping children with the skills to deal with danger themselves. On Sunday, a concerned citizen reportedly called authorities once again after seeing the siblings unaccompanied near a neighborhood park around a third of a mile from their home. The children were picked up by police, who say they followed protocol by turning them over to CPS. Meanwhile, Mrs Meitiv tells Fox 5 DC\u00a0that CPS workers left her and her husband to panic for hours before letting them know their kids were safe. What's more, the elder child, Rafi, insists the scariest part of the hours-long ordeal was being picked up by police. 'They kept the kids for hours,' a shaken Danielle Meitiv told Fox 5 after being reunited with them. 'It's 10:30 at night. They've been missing since 6 o'clock\u2026Somebody called 911 and the police called CPS and they decided to bring the kids here and they didn't call us.' According to Mrs. Meitiv, the children were expected home no later than 6:30. When 6:30 came and went, they became frantic. They would not receive a call from CPS until 8pm. Even then, they say they weren't reunited with their children or even told where they were for hours. in the interim, Rafi tells Fox 5 that initially he believed the responding police officer was simply offering them a lift. Rafi said: . 'The policeman said 'We'll give you a ride home' when we were like two blocks away. And two and a half hours later, after sitting in the car two and a half hours, he said 'I'll bring you home' and, instead, he brought us here.' 'Here' was Child Protective Services, Rafi said. And as he and his sister sat waiting to go home, their parents say 'upper management' at CPS was involved in keeping that from happening. Only at 10:30pm did Mrs. Meitiv say she was reunited with her children and only after promising not to let them off the leash. Parenting style: The Meitivs believe in giving children an unusual amount of independence from a young age . Guarantees: As part of their free-range parenting philosophy, the Meitivs make sure their children carry these badges in case someone worries and asks while they are out on the street . 'They made us sign a safety plan that says we will not leave them attended at all until they follow up, . 'And I'm not gonna risk my kids being snatched again like this by CPS.' When questioned, the Meitivs say they believe in a so-called 'free-range' approach to parenting, which encourages independence from infancy. In March, the CPS found the couple guilty of neglect for letting the children walk home from school alone. It meant the agency would start a file on the family's activities and whereabouts for at least five years. The Meitivs hit back at the ruling, insisting they would continue to bring up their own children as they see fit - whatever the consequences. Unsubstantiated child neglect is not a criminal charge, but is in most cases a prelude to such charges. It usually comes when the CPS has deemed parents to have neglected their children, but has insufficient information or witnesses to press charges or take action.\n"]}

The medicinal marijuana broken down into the oil used by chronic pain sufferers and terminally ill. Users say it is as simple as placing into food or bottles for babies. Some cancer sufferers can use up to a gram each day as treatment with costs of the oil between $80 to $150 per gram . Parents of children with serious illnesses are being taught how to grow their own marijuana crops, such as this one (above) 'And mate, there are two blokes who both have daughters with childhood epilepsy and they have only good things to say about the effect it has had on their kids, so I will keep doing it.' One of those 'blokes' is Peter Rule. His three-year-old daughter, Larisa, suffered brain damage at birth, leaving her partially blind and deaf, and with cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Within two days she was having up to 60 uncontrollable seizures a day - some lasting more than an hour. Doctors, said her mother Jaylen Siery, tried almost everything to stop the convulsions and even considered brain surgery. So when traditional approaches did nothing to relieve her suffering, her parents, turned to less conventional methods, having heard the benefits others had had from a dose of liquid cannabis. Results, they insist, were immediate. Within 24 hours Larisa's seizures were down to just five a day. Ms Siery, 22, told Daily Mail Australia: 'People tell me I\u2019m a terrible mother and they say things like \"you wouldn\u2019t give your daughter heroin\". 'But little do they realise, most of the medicines the doctors gave us before had opium in - the same plant heroin is derived from,' she said. Jaylen Siery (above left with her baby Larisa, also right) tried almost everything to stop the now three-year-old's convulsions and even considered brain surgery. Mr Impey says Australia should follow the lead taken by parts of the United States, where the drug is approved for use in treating some serious illnesses . 'I\u2019m not a bad mother, I want nothing but good for my child, she was in pain, she was suffering, and I tried everything before I tried this'. Mr Rule added: 'A lot of people forget about the hospital time we spend trialling medications until we decided the best treatment we already had in our own backyard. 'Now we are regaining what should have never been lost in the first place, for some the cannabis is the last option other than death. 'The government has not offered to help anyone at all, the demand for this medicine has grown to unmanageable levels .. local community based support is taking control of the health care of people sourcing other options. 'We have no other choice but to support those around us until we see changes regarding the epidemic of failing treatments and over-prescribed pharmaceutical medications.' Mr Rule turned to producing his own marijuana. Now the family has 'about three of four suppliers and they all look after us'. A police spokesperson said, despite instances where people are let off with a caution: 'It is still considered an illicit drug and if you manufacture, possess or use it, then it is against the law and you face prosecution.' Mr Impey is unconcerned at the prospect of prosecution, saying he's providing help where it's needed. The biggest problem they face is having their crops destroyed. 'It's difficult when growing is considered illegal and the police are still taking (away) medicinal cannabis .. but we'll keep going.' Researching Larisa's (second left) symptoms on the internet, Peter Rule (left) discovered a daily dose of liquid cannabis was an alternative therapy. Larisa Rule pictured in hospital. Her parents Peter and Jaylen say doctors tried all conventional methods and a continuous flow of medications to try and bring her seizures under control but 'nothing worked' and that's why they turned to marijuana . He said the liquid is made by soaking the cannabis flowers, leaves, or stems in ethyl alcohol to create a medicine. 'The Government has taken way too long to ensure the safe supply and regulation of whole plant products and while we wait on trials children and adults and dying and suffering,' he claimed. 'Because of this many of us are making a stand and taking back our right to grow and use this plant.' He admits, however, that striking the right balance of the active ingredients in marijuana is still a significant challenge, between the psycho-active chemical and cannabidiol - which is believed to provide much of the medicinal benefits. 'There are a wide variety of strains, we have to work on making one part of it lower and they other higher, each will have different effects on each individual... so it is important to have access to a wide variety of strains.' He says he's not the only one, claiming other communities are following his programmed approach, to try and stop the law intervening. 'The plan we've come up with means everyone does their part, including the individual who might be sick,' Mr Impey said. 'More than 20 people a week are seeking it, and I'm either making medicines for them or help in other ways. 'They just come in and ask me \"is this the stuff that cures cancer?\" You know they're desperate for help when they ask stuff like that.' He revealed that another supplier in Sydney receives double the number of people enquiring about medicinal marijuana, each week. His Woy Woy store is a legitimate hemp outlet, selling various hemp-based products including clothing and cosmetics. He has started a process whereby sufferers can learn to make it for themselves. For about a $2000 investment, those who are sick, or family members, are given the products and taught for a 12-week period on how to produce for themselves, 'rather than paying 6000 for a pound of crap'. 'We are working with people, and a lot of shop owners around the country have got into this,' he said. Mr Rule with daughter Larisa.

'By doing this they don't have to go to the gangs who are growing, don't have to go down the back alley and deal with 16-year-old school-kids. 'A lot of it (marijuana) is now coming from South Australia, all that crap they make, it is a drug they are getting off the street, we are trying to go with a quality approach, focusing on the plants which help and doing it on a smaller scale like a hobby. 'So many people want access so even if it is legalised, it is never going to be just the one person or just the government, it isn't the case now. 'We offer a sort of, I guess, dispensary sort of business, using the same sort of guidelines they do in parts of the US, I heard of in California or Colorado.' In fact, marijuana is legal in more than 20 states in the US, if users can provide proof they are using it as treatment for serious illnesses, like Larisa's acute epilepsy.

'It's not about making money,' he stressed, 'yes, I grow it but more importantly, I help set up people to help themselves'. He said that those suffering epilepsy work together, as do those with Parkinson's, 'we call ourselves cannabis clubs which encourage those coping with a problem being on the same page with someone else who is suffering in the same way'. 'The way we planned it is they get to understand how it best fits their problem, how much they need and they can swap notes, it's about feeling better, that's all.'

So it is should be of little surprise that their choice of wedding decor has started to influence some of Britain's celebrities. As the preparations for Andy Murray and Kim Sears's nuptials reach the final few days, wedding planners for the couple have been seen carrying trees into Dunblane Cathedral ahead of Saturday's ceremony. Scroll down for video . Andy Murray and Kim Sears,pictured at the Wimbledon Champions Dinner 2013,\u00a0are preparing to marry in his home town of Dunblane this weekend . The decoration was first seen at the royal wedding in 2011, when trees lined the aisle at the end of each pew in Westminster Abbey. There is less than 48 hours now until the Scottish tennis champion and his girlfriend exchange vows in his hometown. For the last week, the whole town have been getting involved in the celebrations. The inhabitants of the Dunblane have gone into overdrive for wedding of their most famous resident, lining the streets with bunting and creating special-themed produce in many of the stories. Trees were wheeled into Dunblane cathedral earlier today ahead of the nuptials . Trees lined the aisle at Prince Williams wedding to Kate Middleton . Am official portrait from the royal wedding in 2011 . Since the Wimbledon champion announced his plans to say 'I do' at the cathedral, there have also been plans to line the streets with well-wishers as the couple make their way to the venue. Messages to the happy couple are in many of the shop windows and several business owners have already sent gifts to either Andy, 27, or his bride-to-be ahead of the big day. Lesley Anderson, 52, who owns Point Nouveau Bridal shop in Dunblane, sent a crystal-covered garter to Kim Sears six weeks ago and received kind a thank you note which said it was 'gorgeous'. The ivory-coloured piece is hand-embroidered on the inside with the couple's initials and wedding date and was designed by Nicola Ure from K C Bridal specialists in Falkirk. A handmade card featuring Andy and Kim, 27, on the front drawn by local artist Lorna Brown accompanied the garter. Decorations feature in many of the shop windows in Dunblane . Messages and mascots also feature in the town's stores . The card shows Andy in his kilt holding a tennis racket and Kim in her dress along with their Border Terriers. Kim's reply to the gifts read: 'Dear Lesley and all at Point Nouveau Bridal. 'Just a little note to say a huge thank you for the gorgeous gift Nicola made for me. 'It was very kind of you and I hadn't found a garter yet so thanks ever so much. 'Also, that card of Lorna Brown's is absolutely fabulous! It really made us giggle, especially our two little dogs in the background! 'We are really excited for our big day in a month's time and are happy to be celebrating our wedding in Dunblane. 'Thank you again for your thoughtfulness and generosity. Best wishes, Kim Sears X.' Local shops and shop owners are preparing their shop fronts to reflect the great day . Many of the local businesses have decorated their shop fronts with colourful bunting . Lesley Anderson, 52, (left) who owns Point Nouveau Bridal shop in Dunblane, sent a crystal-covered garter to Kim Sears with a hand-drawn picture of the couple (left). Kim replied with a handwritten note (right . Lesley is close friends with Andy's grandmother, Shirley Erskine, 83 and gave the garter and card to her to take to Kim. She said: 'Out of the blue we got this beautiful card. To be honest we never ever thought we would hear very much at all so when we got this beautiful card we were chuffed to bits. 'I was absolutely delighted. This was such a personal thing. We were really, really chuffed. Andy continues to maintain a close bond with the town - after winning Wimbledon,  he shook hands with all the shop owners on the Dunblane High street. When Murray, 27, says 'I do' on April 11, the guests wishing them well will be largely a gathering of close family and friends. A local butcher has poems about the happy couple in the shop window . Murray's status as one of the world's best tennis players means he has mixed with everyone from A-list celebrities such as James Corden to the Prime Minister and even the Queen. But the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple are tying the knot, is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman. Indeed, when the sport's world number one, Novak Djokovic, was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration, he replied with a curt: 'Not invited', before following up with a more charitable: 'But I wish him all the best.' A sign telling people about parking restrictions around Dunblane Cathedral ahead of Andy's wedding to Kim . Murray has said: 'There won't be any celebrities as such. 'I don't have any celebrity friends so it wasn't something that was planned. '[It'll be] Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. 'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.' There will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer. Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple will hold their nuptials . Murray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer, who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward. Another British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend. For the 27-year-old's many fans and friends in the town, \u00a0at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck \u2013 so they too could toast his big day. The reception will be held at Cromlix, which Murray owns. Kim shows off her engagement ring at the\u00a0Australian Open in Melbourne, Australia, last January . The 300-seat, 12th century cathedral is much bigger than the chapel at Cromlix, which seats only 28. Thousands are expected to line Dunblane High Street on the day. Murray's uncle Niall Erskine said: 'I'm sure it will be a popular decision, as he's had so much support from the people of Dunblane in the past. Andy has admitted that, food aside, he's left much of the preparation for the big day to his betrothed: 'Kim's been pretty much doing it' 'I've tried to help out when she has asked, but I haven't been over-involved. I did all the food and cake tasting which I really enjoyed, although I didn't think I was going to. He added: 'It's a big day for Kim. Pretty much everything is taken care of now. She seems fairly relaxed but as we get closer that might change.'\n"]}

{"question_id": 240, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)The new emojis are here! On Thursday, Apple released a new version of its mobile operating system that includes more diversity than ever when it comes to the race, ethnicity and sexual orientation of its emojis -- those cute little images that users can insert into text messages or emails when words alone just won't cut it. The reaction to this new lineup is, as should be expected with almost anything new in today's hypersensitive climate, a range of cheers and jeers. Why is any of this important, you may ask? For many, these images are far more than tiny clip art for texting. Rather they are seen as recognition that their own ethnicity, sexual orientation, race or even hair color is part of mainstream America -- despite what others might say. This matters in a digital age where texting is how most people communicate and represent themselves dozens -- if not hundreds -- of times every day. Think receiving a text of an image of a person smiling. Or more accurately, think of a white face smiling because up until Thursday's update, all the emojis had pale skin. But that has all changed. Now there's a range of emoji skin tones to pick from, including yellow, brown and black.  I'm sure few people will be upset with this development. But how about in December? Why? Now that will be able to choose the skin tones for each human emoji, and that will also include ... Santa Claus. That shrieking sound you may have heard was from Fox News' Megyn Kelly, who famously stated in 2013 that Santa Claus is absolutely, definitely and without a doubt a white guy.  In fact, thanks to Apple, we may even see Brown Santa emojis this December. (Could that mean he's a Muslim Santa?! Cue even more shrieking from Fox News.) There is more. Apple has now given us gay and lesbian couple emojis, kissing with a heart over their heads. This inclusiveness was cheered by at least one gay news service on Twitter. It's not yet clear if a person who likes to use same-sex kissing emoji couples can be denied service by a person who objects on grounds of \"religious liberty.\" But it would be interesting to hear what any of the 2016 GOP presidential candidates might have to say about \"gay emojis.\" And I would predict some conservative will claim that the kissing gay emojis will turn children gay. The fact is, when you embrace diversity, you will still leave out other minority groups. Redheads, for example, are pretty pissed off because there are no emojis featuring their hair color. In fact, supporters of a redheaded emoji have started a petition that has already garnered several thousand signatures. Even expanding the flags represented by emojis, as Apple has done, comes at some peril. Apparently Canada is overjoyed that finally Apple has included it. But Armenians are not happy they were left out. I must admit that being partially of Palestinian heritage, it's heartening to see that despite the fact that some refuse to recognize a Palestinian state, Apple has chosen to now include a Palestinian flag emoji. Armenia, I feel your pain. Of course the bigger question in the whole diverse-emoji issue is: What took Apple so long? How hard could it have been to add different skin colors to pick from? That the company (finally) did is a step in the right direction: America's demographics are changing, so our representations of who we are -- even representations as tiny as emojis -- should reflect this. Apple has \"evolved\" in showing diversity -- from brown people to same-sex couples. Maybe \"religious liberty\" conservatives who discriminate will follow.\n"]}
{"question_id": 241, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: England star Anthony Watson believes the pain of Bath's European Champions Cup exit can be a driving force in their push to make this season's Aviva Premiership play-offs. Watson and company were left to reflect on what might have been at Dublin's Aviva Stadium as six Ian Madigan penalties gave three-time European champions Leinster a tense 18-15 quarter-final success. Bath dominated for large parts of the second period and claimed tries through fly-half George Ford and captain Stuart Hooper, but hopes of reaching a first top-flight European semi-final since 2006 floundered on their indiscipline. Anthony Watson carries during an impressive Bath performance, but the English side came up short . Attention will now quickly return to the Premiership, with Bath having four games left - against Newcastle, London Irish, Harlequins and Gloucester - in the quest for a top-four finish. 'The overriding emotion is that we are absolutely disappointed,' said Bath full-back Watson, whose counter-attacking brilliance was repeatedly showcased against an often stretched Leinster defence. 'To have battled out of the group as we did (Bath lost their first two games) and then obviously to get into the quarter-final, to get so close and then fail at the end, it is obviously massively disappointing. 'But we have to try to take the positives, and I think a disappointment like this is going to help us in the Premiership.' Bath stayed true to the ball-in-hand attacking principles that have lit up much of this season's Premiership campaign, and at times, Leinster struggled to cope. Ian Madigan was perfect from the tee to hand Leinster the victory in a game where they were second best . In Madigan, though, they had a relentless marksman, whose 100 per cent goalkicking return ultimately sent Leinster marching on and Bath left to focus solely on domestic matters. 'To put on an attacking performance and go through the phases like we did against a quality side like Leinster is just going to add more confidence,' Watson added. 'I think the way we have been playing this year has been a revelation to be a part of, and I have really enjoyed playing for this club. 'I think the progress we have made throughout the year has been awesome. I think the ethos and everything we are building at the club is going in the right direction.' Watson, meanwhile, paid tribute to his Bath and England team-mate Ford, who scored a brilliant solo try and made a darting break that set up Hooper for a second-half touchdown that meant the visitors were always in sight of their opponents on the scoreboard. It was a huge disappointment for Bath, but Watson hopes they can channel the pain to their league campaign . 'I cannot speak highly enough of him (Ford), to be honest,' Watson said. 'He is probably the best ball player I've played with, albeit in a short space of time of two or three years. 'He has got a very mature head on young shoulders, and it's a real privilege to play outside him.' Bath head coach Mike Ford could not mask his disappointment with the result, believing his team paid the price for an opening 40 minutes when they struggled for fluency and kept giving Madigan scoring chances. 'There is a lot of disappointment,' Ford said. 'The first-half performance, especially, we are a lot better than that. 'That last 10-15 minutes, I was pretty convinced we were going to win the game, but it's small margins. George Ford scored one try and created anotehr in a superb performance, but it wasn't enough . 'At half-time, we talked about composure. 'We hadn't been able to build any pressure with ball in hand, and there was also the discipline side of things. Madigan was pretty dead-eye, which cost us. 'We put it together second-half, and I think this will make us stronger. We will look back at the end of the season at this game, particularly, and say this is where Bath became very strong. 'I thought Anthony Watson was on fire at full-back, and George made two good breaks for our tries. It was in our control, we thought. Even at 15-5 down, we were confident we could win the game.' And Bath skipper Hooper said: 'When you get to this stage of the competition, it is about winning. 'The disappointment is two-fold. One is obviously losing the game and the other is probably the individual mistakes we made, particularly in the first half.'\n"]}
{"question_id": 242, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Manchester United have been bolstered by the news that Robin van Persie has declared himself fit ahead of Sunday's derby against Manchester City. Van Persie has missed Manchester United's last six games following an ankle injury he suffered in their 2-1 defeat at Swansea on February 21. In his absence the Red Devils have won all five of their subsequent Premier League matches, with their only blip coming in a FA Cup sixth round exit at home to Arsenal last month. Robin van Persie has declared himself fit for the Manchester derby after missing United's last six games . The 31-year-old arrived for United training on Friday ahead of Sunday's home clash at Old Trafford . Prior to his injury, Van Persie (left) was a regular in United boss Louis van Gaal's starting line-up . In his absence though United have won their last five league matches, climbing up to third in the table . With the return of the 31-year-old it poses the question of where he will fit in Louis van Gaal's now settled 4-3-3 formation and how does he fare against fellow forwards Wayne Rooney, Radamel Falcao and James Wilson. Based on his goalscoring stats in the Premier League this season, Van Persie has provided an attacking threat once more for the Old Trafford outfit. The Holland international has scored 10 goals in 24 appearances and 1,993 minutes of top flight football so far. Only Rooney has fared better - netting 12 times in 27 games and 2,383 minutes of action. In comparison Falcao's stats make for a poor reading of four goals in 20 games and 1,032 minutes with young forward Wilson's strike against QPR in January his only one to date this season in 12 matches and 331 minutes of football. Van Persie (third left) has scored 10 goals in 24 league appearances\u00a0and 1,993 minutes so far this season . Wayne Rooney (centre) scored a stunning half-volley as United beat Aston Villa 3-1 on March 4 . That strike (left) moved the United captain to two goals clear of Van Persie . In addition Van Persie's overall attacking contribution won't have been overlooked by Van Gaal - a man who pays attention to the smallest of details. Van Persie's stats are also favourable in comparison to his fellow strikers in terms of creating chances for others. While he sits sits behind Rooney and Falcao (both four) in terms of assists with two, United's No 20 has provided the second most amount of chances among Van Gaal's forwards with 24. Only Rooney has more with 40, while Falcao has 14 and Wilson providing just the one opportunity. Despite his favourable personal stats though, as a team United have performed better without Van Persie. In his 24 matches played this season, the Red Devils have only won 50 per cent of those - with eight draws and four defeats. Radamel Falcao has scored four goals in 20 games and 1,032 minutes of action for the club this season . James Wilson (right) only goal for the Red Devils this campaign came in a 2-0 win at QPR in January . Furthermore United have only averaged 1.8 points per game with the side scoring 1.7 goals per match and conceding one. In contrast, Van Gaal's side have been triumphant in six of their seven matches without Van Persie with an improved win percentage at 85.70. In his absence to United have averaged 2.6 points per game, scoring two goals and conceding 0.6 per match. Van Gaal has been reluctant to change the starting XI that has fashioned wins against Tottenham, Liverpool and Aston Villa in their last three matches - meaning club record signing Angel Di Maria has been forced to sit on the bench. On current form, the phrase 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it,' is an applicable one to the Red Devils' starting XI as they look to cement a top four finish. For Van Persie, that looks likes playing second fiddle to Rooney as the club's lone striker for now. Angel Di Maria (left) has had to be content with a place on the United bench in recent matches .\n"]}

The family of tragic ski boy Carwyn Scott-Howell were expected to bring his body home this weekend as an investigation into his death ruled out negligence as a factor. Carwyn, seven, plunged 160ft to his death in Flaine, France, while skiing with his mother Ceri and siblings Gerwyn and Antonia, after becoming separated from them. According to state prosecutor Pierre Yves Michau, the schoolboy\u2019s death earlier this month was \u2018a tragic accident\u2019 with no one to blame.

His mother thought he had continued to their accommodation but raised the alarm when he did not return. Mr Michau said: \u2018The inquiry has found the piste was well signposted. The boy would have been aware that he was leaving the piste.

And then when you place it, you just lightly press and hold.' He then uses a white eye pencil on his waterline, the sliver of skin between the eye and the lower lashes, which is a trick that he says will 'widen your eyes'. Finally, for Kylie's famous pouty lips, Rolly uses the controversial Fullips lip suction cup on his mouth for fifteen minutes in order to make his lips swell up and give the impression of a fuller pout. And while his use of the product successfully resulted in slightly plumper lips, teens across the country have been trying similar methods to make their lips look as big as Kylie's with disastrous results; many have experienced less favorable outcomes, with their lips swelling much more than they intended, while others, who have chosen to use other tools such as shot glasses, have cause permanent damage to their lips after accidentally shattering the glass around their mouths. Practically twins: After applying makeup and using the lip suction cup for fifteen minutes, Rolly, right, does a pretty good impression of 17-year-old Kylie, left . Social media makeover: The ultimate finish touch, Rolly puckered his pout and posed for a selfie a la Kylie at the end of the video . In fact, Kylie herself responded to the suction cup craze, writing on Twitter: 'I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look. [sic]' Lucky for Rolly, the beauty expert seems to have mastered the Fullips device. Once his lips were plump, he overdrew them with a lip pencil like Kylie does, as extending the lip line creates a further illusion of fullness. While Rolly's edited video in less than three minutes long, the star herself recently revealed that her own beauty routine can last hours. 'A good night out is, like, two and a half hours for full makeup, curling hair, whatever,' Kylie told\u00a0Teen Vogue. 'I'm never going to spend just 20 minutes, you know?'\n"]}

A disability badge holder who claimed he could only walk 200 metres ended up in court after council officials noticed a newspaper report recounting his exploits on a 191-mile hike. When Paul Gregory, 51, applied to renew his blue badge, he claimed exercise left him breathless, despite being a keen walker and member of a mountaineering club. He was exposed when Bedford Borough Council staff read an article in The Westmorland Gazette,  describing how the 'experienced walker' had been attacked by cows in Cumbria on the third day of a hike in 2012. The article, which featured a picture of him dressed in walking gear, told how he was knocked over by four cows in a field at the edge of Shap in Cumbria. The council also found he had spent a weekend walking in Wales days before making a blue badge application. Gregory, of Bedford, pleaded guilty to two counts of dishonestly obtaining a blue badge by misrepresenting his physical abilities at Luton Magistrates' Court. He was fined \u00a3795, ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work and pay a\u00a0\u00a360 victim surcharge.

Her grave provides the first evidence of an ancient Magdalenian burial in the region and an engraved stone found near her remains appears to have been a makeshift tombstone. But the reasons why the female - dubbed 'The Red Lady of El\u00a0Mir\u00f3n' - was buried in such an elaborate tomb, close to an area where her peers would have lived day-to-day, continues to baffle archaeologists. The Red Lady's remains (burial site pictured) were found in the El Mir\u00f3n Cave in Cantabria, Spain. Radiocarbon dating suggests she was buried 18,700 years ago. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal . During the Upper Paleolithic period the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. The Red Lady's remains were first uncovered in 2010 during excavations of such a cave called El Mir\u00f3n Cave in Cantabria between Santander and Bilbao. After discovering a range of individual bones, researchers from the University of New Mexico led by Lawrence Straus, unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave.

After discovering a series of individual bones, researchers  unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed. She was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy', explained\u00a0the researchers , and would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas.' Herself and her peers would have used stone tools, needles made from bones and projectile tips fashioned from the antlers of the deer and the cave would have been used for shelter and living quarters. They would have hunted for ibex and red deer, fished for salmon and ate plants, including some seeds and mushrooms. When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. A engraved tombstone was found nearby. The pigment and tombstone has led researchers to speculate she was a person of status or authority and was ritualistically buried in such a way to oversee her subjects.

When the remains were first uncovered they were stained with a sparking red material, later found to be red ochre from a haematite crystal. This has since faded. Haematite comes from the Greek word for 'blood' and it is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted in this way, and the researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. However, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual. In Mayan practices, for example, bodies were covered in a similar way using blue pigment to signify they were sacrifices to the gods. But the fact she was buried within the living quarters of her peers has led the anthropologists to suggest she was instead a person of status or authority and was buried in such a way to oversee her subjects. This status is also hinted at due to the presence of a primitive tombstone. During the excavation a large rock was found that reportedly fell from the ceiling and had been engraved with straight lines. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif  that they suggest represents a pubic triangle, while another has been speculatively referred to as a schematic hand with fingers. 'Could these be indicators of the presence of the woman buried behind the block?' said the researchers in their paper '\"The Red Lady of El Mir\u00f3n\". Lower Magdalenian life and death in Oldest Dryas Cantabrian Spain: an overview' published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. In addition there are lines engraved on the bedrock lower wall and ledge against which part of the corpse had been laid behind the block.

During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC . Experts suggest the so-called 'Red Lady' was 'robust, relatively tall, [and] apparently healthy'. She would have lived in the 'cold, open environment of Oldest Dryas' and ate ibex, red deer and salmon. Her body was interred at the rear of the cave (pictured) where her peers would have lived and slept . Haematite comes from the Greek for 'blood' and red ochre (pictured) is often used as a pigment, particularly in cave paintings. It is not known why the Red Lady was painted, and researchers are unsure whether her body or clothes were covered in the pigment. But, they have speculated it was likely a burial ritual . The eastern face of the block was additionally 'intensely stained' with red ochre in the area near where the bones were found, creating a link between the block and body. 'The ochre may constitute the only demonstrable \u201cgrave offering\u201d,' continued the researchers. 'The burial is one of the most complex features of the Magdalenian record in El Mir\u00f3n. 'The corpse seems to have been laid on her left side with her back toward the block and chest toward the cave wall. 'The head  would have been at the northern end of the burial. The corpse was probably tightly flexed in fetal position. 'Because many of the bones are stained with red ochre, it is possible that either the woman's clothes had been stained with this material - for decoration and/or hide preservation - or her corpse was stained as part of a burial ritual.' Anthropologists from the University of New Mexico said: 'The burial is one of the most complex features of the Magdalenian record in El Mir\u00f3n.

Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide) The cave site of El Mir\u00f3n is in the Rio As\u00f3n valley of Cantabria, Spain. Its opening is around 850ft (260 metres) above sea level and the inside is around 100ft (30 metres) deep, 52ft (16 metres wide). Research has shown that the site was occupied from the Middle Paleolithic 41,000 years ago up to around 1400AD. During the Upper Paleolithic the Magdalenian culture occupied much of western Europe and spanned from as early as 10,000 BC. Magdalenian hunters  lived in caves, but sites have been found that consisted of shelters made from bones and animals skins. They predominantly hunted reindeer and evidence suggests they lived a somewhat nomadic life. In addition to El Mir\u00f3n, Magdalenian sites have been found from Portugal in the west to as far east as Poland. The El Mir\u00f3n site has been excavated 1996 as part of the by the El Mir\u00f3n Prehistoric Project including Lawrence Guy Straus and Manuel Gonz\u00e1lez Morales from the Universidad de Cantabria. During the excavations, a large engraved rock was found. Among these engravings the researchers spotted a V-shaped motif that has been said to represent a pubic triangle, suggesting a female was buried nearby.\u00a0The eastern face of the block (shown on the left of this map) was also stained' with red ochre . After discovering a series of individual bones (plotted by red dots), researchers unearthed a mandible and tibia that suggested a full skeleton was placed towards the rear of the cave. Radiocarbon dating suggests this burial took place 18,700 years ago and that the female was aged between 35 and 40 when she was entombed . In particular, its blood-red colour may have been symbolic of life and death. Following her burial, the anthropologists said the grave was partially disturbed by a wolf, or similar-sized carnivore. They then believe the skeleton was stained a second time and covered again. 'The scenario that is hypothesised is that the carnivore only minimally disturbed the skeleton, since the bones were unconnected by this time,' the experts continued. 'Then humans apparently found the exposed tibia and thus the rest of the skeleton. They may have removed the cranium and most of the largest bones without totally rearranging the fundamental anatomical order of the former corpse, whose hands may have been placed near her head and feet tucked under her bottom.' Using detailed mineralogical maps of the region, it is thought the Magdalenian people mined the distinctive ochre from an outcrop in the modern-day city of Santo\u00f1a, situated around 12 miles (20km) from the cave. 'Although lacking in clear grave offerings, the amounts of red ochre on the bones and in the burial infilling and the apparent association with rock art - both engravings and red ochre on the block against which the corpse's back had probably rested - the evidence points to a ritualized interment,' concluded the researchers. 'But, at the end of the day, we are left with a mystery: who was the \u201cRed Lady\u201d of El Mir\u00f3n and why was she given such special treatment after her death?'\n"]}

Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi was allowed to leave Adiala Prison in Rawalpindi\u00a0late on Thursday. His release was slammed with Indians calling it an 'insult' to the victims of the three-day onslaught, which was blamed on the banned Pakistani militant group Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT). Pakistani security personnel escort Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, the alleged mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai attacks, as he leaves court after a hearing in Islamabad on January 1 . LeT's charitable wing, Jamaat-ud-Dawa (JuD), confirmed Lakhvi's release. A senior JuD official said: 'Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi has been released from jail. He is free now and in a secure place. We can't say exactly where he is at the moment for security reasons.' Another official said Lakhvi would receive a hero's welcome when he arrived at JuD headquarters. It comes after nearly four months of wrangling over Lakhvi's detention after a judge granted him bail in December, sparking an angry response from New Delhi. Pakistan's government slapped Lakhvi with a series of detention orders but judges repeatedly cancelled them. On Thursday the Lahore High Court ordered his release, conditional on a two million rupee (32,000 U.S. dollars or \u00a322,000) bond. India has long seethed at Pakistan's failure either to hand over or prosecute those accused of planning and organising the Mumbai attacks. A spokesman for India's home ministry, who asked not to be named, condemned Lakhvi's release. They said: 'This is a very disappointing announcement. An insult to the victims of the 26/11 Mumbai attack. The global community should take serious note of Pakistan's double-speak on terrorism.'

The horror of the Mumbai carnage played out on live television as commandos battled around ten heavily armed gunmen, who arrived by sea on the evening of November 26, 2008. The gunmen carried out twelve coordinated shooting and bombing attacks lasting four days, and killing 166 people. They targeted guests at two five star hotels, a Jewish centre and commuters at the city's main railway station. It took the authorities three days to regain full control of the city. Nine of the gunmen were killed. She said: 'Inordinate delay in extending cooperation by India complicated the case and weakened the prosecution.' Lakhvi and six other suspects were charged in Pakistan - but their cases have made little progress in five years. Delhi has long accused Islamabad of prevaricating over the trials, while Pakistan has alleged that India failed to give it crucial evidence. Lakhvi's initial bail order in December prompted an angry response from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who said it came as 'a shock to all those who believe in humanity'. Pakistani analyst Hasan Askari said he was at a loss to understand why the case had not been resolved.

New Delhi has long said there is evidence that 'official agencies' in Pakistan were involved in plotting the attack. Islamabad denies the charge but JuD, seen as a front for the militant LeT and listed as a banned terror outfit by the United Nations, operates openly in the country. Pakistan has long been accused of playing a 'double game' with militants by supporting groups it thinks it can use for its own strategic ends, particularly in disputed Kashmir.

The condemned pair will be given white clothing to wear, which symbolises the afterlife, before beginning their fatal trek and are given the option to be blindfolded with a piece of fabric before facing the firing squad who will be lined up anywhere from five to 10 metres in front of them. The confronting decisions continue for the death row inmates with the opportunity to choose whether to stand, sit or kneel before a cross is placed over their hearts acting as a target for the 12 riflemen - of which nine will have blanks and only three will have live rounds. If necessary their hands or feet will be tied to a 3m high pole or worse still - a wooden execution chair. The offender is then given a final chance to calm down for a maximum of three minutes before the riflemen are ordered to shoot them in the heart. It is then that the executing commander brandishes his sword as a sign for the 12 shooters to begin to fire their rifles. If the doctor confirms once the fires have been shot that the prisoner is still breathing -\u00a0the executing commander orders for a pistol be put to the temple just above the ear for a final shot. However, the shooting can continue on the condemned, if the doctor declares that there is still signs of life. Some of the last words the men  will hear are 'laksanakan, laksanakan' - meaning 'execute, execute' in Indonesian. The Australian men will be given a maximum of three minutes to calm down before being shot in the heart . Three shooters will have live rounds while nine other rifelemen will have blanks . The TV footage broadcasted four months ago showed Brimob executioners dressed in military fatigues with semi-automatic rifles practicing for the following day's execution by repeatedly firing at bullseye targets . Not even refusing to sign their death warrants on Saturday will delay the pair's deaths for their hand in plotting to smuggle 8kg of heroin out of Bali 10 years ago. The stark reality struck for the pair when they requested their final wishes - Sukumaran to continue his love of painting right up until the bitter end and Chan, who became a minister during his time behind bars, to attend a church service with his family. The prisoners can also make a final written request which can include declaring their guilt or innocence, along with how and where they wish to be buried. One of the last paintings Sukumaran will ever create was shown to the media on the Javanese island by his Australian lawyer Julian McMahon on Saturday. The haunting self portrait depicts a gun shot wound to his heart. This comes as coffins with both men's names and Wednesday's date were inscribed on wooden crosses by local funeral director Suhendra Putro. The clearing where the pair will be executed\u00a0called Nirbaya - or more appropriately known as Death Valley . Sukumaran's self portrait shows a gaping wound on his heart (left) and the chilling words '72hrs just started' on the back of the frame (right) The television report also listed 27 very precise points about how the execution will be carried out . A disturbing video of just how the executions would be played out was aired across Indonesia the day before the executions of five foreign drug traffickers on\u00a0January 18 this year. The eerie step-by-step recreation on Channel 1 shows a white figure wearing a black hood over its head with its arms tied behind its head - while the firing squad is represented by a row of toy or robotic looking figures. The television report also listed 27 very precise points about how the execution will be carried out. Apart from the reenactment, the video shows the actual Brimob executioners dressed in military fatigues with semi-automatic rifles practicing for the following day's execution by repeatedly firing at bullseye targets. The Australian men are expected to be led from their isolated cells in Batu prison through the wildly dense tropical forest up a 3km steep winding track before meeting their demise .

Jade Ruthven, 33, of Perth, Western Australia, was shocked when she found the scathing note claiming to be from \u2018a few of the girls\u2019, cruelly criticising her for posting photos of her six-month-old daughter Addison on Facebook. \u2018Dear Jade, I have got together with a few of the girls and we are all SO OVER your running commentary on your life and every single thing Addy does,\u2019 the letter begins. \u2018We all have kids that we are besotted\u00a0with ... But we don\u2019t ram it down everyone else\u2019s neck!!!\u2019 Jade Ruthven, 33, of Perth, Western Australia, was shocked when she found a scathing note  criticising her for posting too many photos of her six-month-old daughter Addison on Facebook . Jade Ruthven was devastated when she received the  unsigned letter in her mailbox . As the letter continues, the typos and punctuation become more intense and frequent. \u2018She crawls off the mat \u2013 we DON\u201dT care!!!!! She\u2019s six months old \u2013 BIG DEAL!!!! \u2018Stop and think \u2013 if every mother posted all that cr*p about their kid \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019d get over it pretty quickly.\u2019 The author claims the rant was written on behalf of everyone who views Jade\u2019s Facebook posts. \u2018I guess you are just p***ing a lot of people off with all your \u201cAddy this and Addy that\u201d. \u2018We all thought it might ease off after the first month but it hasn\u2019t,\u2019 the letter continues. \u2018Not everyone is as interested as you are about what Addy does so give us all a break. \u2018We\u2019re doing this to let you know what people really think.\u2019 The dental hygienist still doesn\u2019t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can\u2019t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty . Jade and her husband Ryan (pictured with their daughter Addison) were both very angry but chose to try and see the funny side of the ridiculous letter . Jade sent the letter to comedian Em Rusciano, who posted it to her Facebook page and described it as 'next-level mean' in an opinion piece for\u00a0news.com.au. For\u00a0Jade the letter came completely out of the blue and was like a slap in the face, particularly as she is a first-time mother trying to find her feet. \u2018I was actually excited when I checked the mail and saw a hand written envelope thinking it was an invite. Never in my wildest dreams did I expect what was in it!\u2019 Jade told Daily Mail Australia. \u2018At first I was in shock and thought this letter must be a joke. I read it and re-read it about four times. \u2018I was shaking with anger and shock to think a so-called friend of mine could be so heartless and gutless to not even sign their name.\u2019 The dental hygienist still doesn\u2019t know who was responsible for the letter. Jade can\u2019t think why anybody would feel the need to be so nasty. \u2018To be honest I have no idea why anyone would do this to me. I don\u2019t think I have had an enemy in my whole life,\u2019 she said. \u2018My husband Ryan was just as angry as me but we soon decided to laugh it off as a bad joke. Jade and her friends responded by creating the hashtag #Addyspam and cheekily posting a stream of photos of the beautiful bub on Facebook - sending a strong message to the hateful author . Jade was accused of 'p***ing' everybody off by posting too many photos of her baby daughter on Facebook . \u2018These people clearly have too much time on their hands to sit and chat about my Facebook usage. It\u2019s quite sad really.\u2019 The cruel nature of the letter spurred Jade to stand up for herself. She refused to bow down to the bullies. \u2018To have someone do this to me, in truth, makes me feel sick,\u2019 said Jade. \u2018Lucky for me I am a strong, healthy person. Being a first time mum is hard enough to get your head around but for someone who was feeling alone or who was struggling with the challenges of motherhood this could have had terrible consequences. \u2018But it takes a lot more to keep me down than a nasty letter!\u2019 Jade wants the coward author to know their nasty act has not brought her down. She has also vowed to continue to post photos of her treasured baby. \u2018I have had people contact me saying if this had happened to them at this time in their bub\u2019s life, it would have sent them over the edge. \u2018I am glad I was the one that got this letter, not someone in a more vulnerable state.\u2019 Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has \u2018backfired\u2019, as she is \u2018feeling more loved and supported than ever\u2019 Jade insists that not for one minute did she consider changing her behaviour on Facebook. Instead, she decided to deal with the bullies with a sense of humour. \u2018No way did I feel self-conscious or consider changing my online activity,\u2019 she said. 'That\u2019s how I think this person can\u2019t be that close to me. If they were they would know I would never take this lying down, start crying in the corner and then take myself off Facebook. \u2019In fact my friends and I started a hashtag, #Addyspam and posted pics of Addy on Facebook all night long!\u2019 Jade says the attempt to shame and isolate her has \u2018backfired\u2019, as she is \u2018feeling more loved and supported than ever\u2019. Rather, it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers . \u2018The support I have received from family, friends and even total strangers has blown me away.\u2019 Facebook is a crucial tool for Jade and Ryan to share their daughter\u2019s life with their distant relatives. \u2018Addy\u2019s grandparents and a lot of family and friends live overseas. Facebook is the only way they can really keep in touch.\u2019 As a mother, Jade knew she didn\u2019t want to stoop to the bullies\u2019 level. Rather, it is an opportunity for her to set an example for her daughter and support other new mothers. \u2018I want my daughter to grow up a strong and confident girl and if she ever does encounter bullies. \u2018I want her to feel strong enough to stand up for herself. \u2018Also I think parents should do what feels right for you and your bub. \u2018Everyone will try and give you their opinions, just smile and nod!\u2019\n"]}

Anna Broom, of Gillingham, in Kent, has not worked since the age of 19, during which time she has claimed more than \u00a3100,000 in benefits. The jobless 33-year-old now wants an extra \u00a310,000 to fund her dream 'traditional English wedding and party in a castle'. Miss Broom is desperate for a church ceremony, designer dress, horse and carriage - 'like Katie Price' - and champagne for her 50 guests. Scroll down for video . Dream wedding: Miss Broom wants the government to loan her \u00a310,000 for her wedding to Jordan Burford . And she wants the taxpayer to stump up a further \u00a32,000 for her honeymoon, where she hopes to jet off to Mexico. The Gillingham resident claims it is her 'basic human right' to be a bride and says that tying the knot would boost her fragile confidence and encourage her to try and find a job again. Miss Broom receives monthly benefits including \u00a3460 disability living allowance and joint \u00a3200 housing benefit with fianc\u00e9 Jordan Burford, 39, who also gets \u00a3134 income support a month. The size 24 bride-to-be said: 'I've dreamed about being a bride since I was 12 years old. 'I deserve a fairy-tale church wedding and a party in a castle - but there's no way I could afford it on benefits and I can't work because I'm overweight.' True gent: Miss Broom met her\u00a0fianc\u00e9 in a pub in 2009 and said it was 'love at first sight' - she now wants a 'fairy-tale church wedding and a party in a castle' as well as a honeymoon in Mexico, paid for by the taxpayer . She added: 'I want the taxpayer to fund my \u00a310,000 dream wedding - it's a basic human right to be a bride. I don't see why I should have a small wedding at a registry office - I wouldn't be able to fit in all my guests and a church wedding is far more romantic. 'I'm stuck in a rut at the moment and can't find the motivation to lose weight, but if I was getting married I know I'd slim down because all eyes would be on me.' Miss Broom left school without any qualifications and started a job as a nursery nurse aged 16 for two years. She left after being overlooked for a secretarial role by a 'skinny blonde' and applied for several other jobs, without success. She then lost interest in trying to find work and resorted to binge-eating crisps and sweets. Within a year, Miss Broom weighed 17 stone and in 2001, aged 19, was declared unfit to work after suffering from depression and back problems associated with her size. She qualified for benefits and has not worked since.

Jobless: Miss Broom has not worked since 2001 when she was 19 years old after she was declared unfit to work after suffering from depression and back problems associated with her size . But Miss Broom found comfort in her life in the form of fianc\u00e9 Jordan, who she met in a pub in 2009. Recalling the moment, she said: 'It was love at first sight. He's got a lovely smile and he's a true gent. We have lots in common - we both love heavy metal and Bon Jovi.' Two years later, he popped the question outside a Primark store. She said: 'The ring is lovely - it has a gold band with a pink stone.' After getting engaged, the 33-year-old started making plans for the big day after leafing through glossy magazines and watching wedding shows on TV. She said: 'I realised I want a traditional English wedding - a church ceremony, followed by a reception in a castle. 'I dream about arriving in a horse and carriage - like Katie Price!' She added: 'I picture myself in a silk dress that shows off my cleavage, as Jordan likes my boobs! 'I'd like a long veil and sparkly red designer heels and I want two bridesmaids and flower girls scattering petals down the aisle. 'We'd serve posh prawn canapes, a roast dinner and champagne. I'd have around 50 guests with a five-tier cake and a big buffet too. 'I'd also love a big band and have picked out Savage Garden's Truly, Madly Deeply for our first dance.' But she quickly realised she would be unable to foot the bill for her dream wedding. She said: 'I was gutted. We only get \u00a3800 a month in benefits between us and after we've paid for bills, a night out at the pub, dog food for our Labrador, cigarettes and the odd kebab, there's barely anything left. 'I'd rather not get married than have a cheap do - it'd only make me unhappy.' Miss Broom receives monthly benefits including \u00a3460 disability living allowance and joint \u00a3200 housing benefit with fianc\u00e9 Jordan Burford, 39, who also gets \u00a3134 income support a month.\u00a0Mr Burford suffers from epilepsy and has never worked. The total the couple receive equates to \u00a3794 a month. But Miss Broom says that after 'we've paid for bills, a night out at the pub, dog food for our Labrador, cigarettes and the odd kebab, there's barely anything left.' Now she hopes the government will loan her the money for the big day, as well as her honeymoon in the Mexican sunshine. The 33-year-old admits she will struggle to pay back the full amount and says she'd prefer to go halves. She said: 'Even if I only got \u00a35,000 in vouchers to put towards the wedding, that'd make life easier. 'Jordan just wants us to get married and only wants a limo and cream suit, but I want to feel like a princess for the day.' Jonathan Isaby, Chief Executive at The Taxpayers' Alliance, said: 'The benefit system is a valuable safety net but must not be a comfort blanket. 'People have to finance their own weddings rather than rely on a government loan, which would be funded by the taxpayer, to pick up the tab.'\n"]}

Friends reported her missing later the same week along with her mother and sister after they flew to Spain when she failed to respond to calls and messages. They discovered her clothes and bank cards were still at a nearby flat where she was staying. Her friends and relatives put up missing posters around Marbella and the neighbouring resort of Puerto Banus. They also set up the 'Find Agnese Klavina' Facebook page linked to a GoFundMe page to help raise funds for legal fees linked to the search. The waitress was spending the summer in Marbella after flying to the resort in May to start work as a receptionist at luxury beach club the Ocean Club.

Agnese was allegedly illegally detained by Porter and Capper, according to police who have studied footage from Aqwa Mist's car park . Porter, from Liverpool, says he fell asleep on the back seat of a Mercedes they left the club in before the drop-off. Forensic experts discovered a blonde hair in the boot of the car during a sweep of the vehicle but were unable to discover who the hair belonged to during initial tests. Further tests are now expected to be ordered on the human hair and samples taken during a search of a motorboat belonging to Capper's family. The vessel was seized in a port in the province of Murcia, around 300 miles east of Marbella. Agnese\u00a0is pictured partying at Aqwa Mist  shortly before she went missing in September . Authorities are probing the possibility Agnese was killed and her body thrown into the sea from the boat, which left a port in Fuengirola near Marbella days after she vanished. Capper and Porter are currently being investigated on suspicion of Agnese's illegal detention following the recovery of CCTV footage from Aqwa Mist's car park and a damning report by a Cracker-style criminal psychologist claiming her facial expressions show she did not leave the club voluntarily. A doorman at the club was initially arrested alongside them for allegedly obstructing police inquiries - but the case against him dropped after he and the two Brits took part in a police reconstruction of the last night Agnese was seen alive. The criminal inquiry is expected to become a homicide probe if new DNA tests show Agnese was in the boot of the car or on the motorboat. Neither suspect has yet been formally charged with any crime, as is normal in Spain in the early stages of an investigation. A secrecy order had been placed over the case, giving lawyers acting for the British suspects and Agnese's family limited access to information. The order has now been lifted and the distraught mum and sister of Latvian-born Agnese, who was spending her summer working in Marbella after leaving her London home of the past five years, are now expected to be allowed to meet judicial authorities in Spain so they can be briefed on the investigation.

Agnese's mum Daiga, in an appeal for information about her daugther's whereabouts in February, said: 'We can't believe this is happening. 'It has now been nearly six months without our daughter - not knowing if she is still alive or where she may be.

A spokesman for the Find Agnese Klavina campaign said in a Facebook post: 'After seven months of waiting the secrecy of the case has finally been lifted by the Spanish authorities and as such the file of the case has been opened. 'We have had yesterday the spectacle of two of the accused men being 'interrogated' at court by the judge. 'Westley Capper and Craig Porter were repeatedly asked to answer questions relating to the case. 'They refused, citing their constitutional right to remain silent. 'Our Agnese has never been seen since [she disappeared six months ago]. 'How can we still not have charges? 'We want justice for Agnese and all the other unfortunate missing people in Marbella.

The blob in the ocean was discovered last year, with temperatures one to four degrees Celsius (two to seven degrees Fahrenheit) above surrounding \u2018normal\u2019 water. And the blob has now extended about 1,000 miles (1,600km) offshore, from Mexico up to Alaska, and could herald a warmer summer for some regions. Scroll down for video . A 'blob' of warm water 2,000 miles across is sitting in the Pacific Ocean (shown in diagram). Since last June it has extended from Alaska to Mexico. It has been present since 2013 and causing fish to seek shelter elsewhere. And a new University of Washington study says it could be responsible for droughts . A new study by the University of Washington found that a high-pressure ridge could be causing the blob, by trapping heat in the water. In June of last year, the huge patch of water stretched 1,000 miles (1,600km) in each direction, and was 300ft (90 metres) deep. Dr Nick Bond, a climate scientist at the University of Washington, coined the term \u2018the blob\u2019 in June. Since the year 2000, seven western states in the US has seen their driest periods in centuries: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming. And scientists in California have warned that the region may be experiencing a century-long 'mega-drought'. The warnings came after sediment studies showed California is currently experiencing the driest spell since 1580, and that the regular rainfall seen during the last century is likely to have been a temporary deviation in a cycle of droughts and very occasional rainfall over the last 3,000 years. In 2013, California received less rain than in any year since its formation as a state in 1850. However droughts lasting more than 100 years are far from unheard of in the state. Looking back over several thousand years, droughts have been known to last over a decade, and in some cases they can last a century. And the patterns tend to repeat, meaning another drought of this length will probably happen again in the future. Ten months later, the blob is now squashed up against the coast, and Dr Bond says all models point to it continuing through the end of this year. \u2018In the fall of 2013 and early 2014 we started to notice a big, almost circular mass of water that just didn't cool off as much as it usually did, so by spring of 2014 it was warmer than we had ever seen it for that time of year,\u2019 said Dr Bond. Researchers said it may have contributed to the state of Washington's mild 2014 winter and might signal a warmer summer. But exactly how this area of warmer water has formed, or how long it will stay, remains a mystery. One thing that can be studied, though, is its effects. As air passes over warmer water and reaches the coast it brings more heat and less snow, which the scientists say helped cause current drought conditions in California, Oregon and Washington. The researchers said that it might not only be causing warmer temperatures on the West coast, but also cooler temperatures on the East coast. It could also be playing a part in circulating cold and wet air to the central and eastern states of the US. California's drought (stock image shown left) is one of the worst on record, while the East coast of the US (Central Park in New York shown right) has seen unusually cold temperatures . It is also having an effect on marine life. Fish have been spotted in unusual places, supporting recent reports that West coast marine ecosystems are suffering and the food web is being disrupted by warm, less nutrient-rich Pacific Ocean water. Dr Bond noted that, while this phenomenon likely wasn\u2019t caused by global warming, it could be a sign of similar weather to come. \u2018This is a taste of what the ocean will be like in future decades,\u2019 Dr Bond said. \u2018It wasn't caused by global warming, but it's producing conditions that we think are going to be more common with global warming.\u2019 The 'blob' is also having an effect on marine life.

Paula McKay was told her daughter Natasha had suffered brain damage and would be left disabled after errors were made by medics at the former Sharoe Green Hospital in Preston. When she became pregnant with her second child, less than two years later, she was reassured the same mistakes would not be repeated. But the promise was an empty one. When Patrick was delivered at the same hospital, the same errors were made, leaving her son brain damaged and severely disabled like his older sister. Ms McKay, from Leyland, near Preston, has been awarded \u00a313 million in compensation, a \u00a37 million care package for her daughter five years after a \u00a36 million sum for her son's lifelong care was agreed. Paula McKay, centre, has won a 20-year legal battle to secure \u00a313 million compensation for her two children Natasha, 24, left and Patrick, 22, right. They were both left severely disabled after the same mistakes were repeated by staff at the same hospital, two years apart, during their births . Maternity staff at the hospital failed to monitor Ms McKay, and failed to recognise Natasha was in distress in the womb. She was delivered 10 weeks prematurely by C-section, but staff failed to ventilate her properly, which caused severe brain damage . Natasha, who is now 24, is confined to a wheelchair and will rely on 24-hour care from a team of nurses who help her dress and eat for the rest of her life. After she was starved of oxygen at birth, Natasha was diagnosed with severe cerebral palsy and epilepsy. Maternity staff at the hospital failed to monitor Ms McKay, and failed to recognise Natasha was in distress in the womb. She was delivered 10 weeks prematurely by C-section, but staff failed to ventilate her properly, which caused severe brain damage. Seventeen months later when she became pregnant with her son, Patrick, Ms McKay returned to the same hospital. Staff assured her, the same mistakes would not be repeated. However, medics once again failed to monitor her condition, and did not spot that Patrick's heart rate was very low. Ms McKay was, once again, rushed to theatre for an emergency C-section to deliver her son. As a result of the mistakes made, Patrick, now 22, was left brain-damaged and with cerebral palsy. Ms McKay, who has since divorced Natasha and Patrick's father and remarried, said what had happened to her family was a nightmare. 'Natasha and Patrick have been through so much in their lives and it has been heart-breaking to see them suffer at times due to the injuries they were left with.' She told the Telegraph: 'It has been a huge struggle. This feels like the end of a very long, dark tunnel. 'It\u2019s obviously devastating for it to happen to one of your children, but for it to happen to two of them, you just can\u2019t take it in.' She added: 'It upsets me to think about any other families going through the same ordeal and having to fight hospital trusts to help children they have failed. 'However I would say to any other parents in the same situation not to give up hope, you can eventually get the help you and your child needs and things can get better.' The family have fought for 20 years to secure compensation to ensure Natasha and Patrick will receive the care they need for life. In 2008 the NHS North West strategic health authority, formerly the body responsible for the hospital, admitted liability in Patrick's case. Two years later the NHS Litigation Authority paid \u00a36 million for his ongoing care. When Ms McKay went into labour with her second child, medics once again failed to monitor her condition, and did not spot that Patrick's heart rate was very low. Ms McKay was, once again, rushed to theatre for an emergency C-section to deliver her son . Natasha and Patrick both suffered brain damage, and as a result were diagnosed with cerebral palsy. Natasha is confined to a wheelchair and requires 24-hour care from a team of nurses . However, Natasha's case took longer to investigate and conclude, because it was extremely complicated. The strategic health authority, which no longer exists, admitted liability in her case five years ago when she was 19. The final compensation, again paid by the NHS Litigation Authority, was delayed to allow Natasha to finish at Beaumont College, a specialist college for people affected by cerebral palsy. The delay also allowed for a property to be bought, extended and adapted for Natasha, to live with a team of full-time carers. Cerebral palsy is a neurological condition that affects movement and co-ordination. It is often caused by brain damage, during or shortly after birth. Other causes of the condition include: . It is estimated that around one in 400 people in the UK is affected. The symptoms of cerebral palsy normally become apparent during the first three years of a child's life. The main characteristics of the condition are: . The symptoms can affect different areas of the body and vary in severity from person to person. Many sufferers will also suffer repeated seizures, drooling problems and swallowing difficulties. Some will also have communication and learning difficulties. Source: NHS Choices . The family have now been awarded \u00a37 million in Natasha's case. Ms McKay said the final settlement has brought her some comfort, reassuring her that her children will always be cared for. 'I am relieved that I no longer have to worry about what will happen when I am not here anymore, and that both will have access to the specialist care they need and deserve,' she said. 'Another important factor of this financial settlement is that it will ensure Natasha receives excellent ongoing care that will not ever be affected by local or national budget cuts.' Olivia Scates, a partner at JMW Solicitors, who represented both Natasha and Patrick, said this was an 'unprecedented situation' where two children in one family had suffered brain damage and cerebral palsy as a result of negligence. 'Paula has had to cope with two avoidable tragedies involving her children,' she said. 'To go through such an ordeal once and a child's life to be devastated is tragic, for it to happen to two children in the same family is unbelievably sad. 'However Paula is an incredible mother who has dedicated her life to caring for Natasha and Patrick and has conducted herself with great dignity throughout their cases. 'Nothing can be done to turn back the clock but with the settlement of Natasha's case Paula will have the support she needs to provide that care to her daughter and ensure that she does not have to worry about the future, especially when she is not here anymore, which was a huge concern. 'Natasha will never be able to live independently, work or do any of the things the rest of us take for granted. 'However as well as the highly specialist accommodation and equipment she requires now she will have access to excellent care that will improve her quality of life and enable her to access therapies and activities designed for people with her level of disability.' Ms McKay has a third child, George, now 19, who was born at Kings College in London without any complications. He is now training to become a nurse, to continue to help disabled people in his working life, after helping care for his siblings at home. Sharoe Green Hospital closed in 2004, when it merged with the Royal Preston Hospital to become Preston Acute Hospitals NHS Trust.\n"]}

He was a docile captured killer in the care of paramedics tending to his gunshot wounds. Dzhokhar \"Jahar\" Tsarnaev's defense team is seeking to spare him from a death sentence for his part two years ago in the Boston Marathon bombings and murder of an MIT police officer. Having focused on his dead older brother, portraying Tamerlan Tsarnav as harsh, overbearing and bent on jihad, they now shift to the younger brother who tagged after him, as one witness said, \"like a puppy.\" The sentencing phase of the federal case will resume Monday. The jury was sent home Thursday because a juror was sick. Tsarnaev was convicted April 8 on all 30 counts, including 17 that carry a possible death penalty. The defense's transition from one brother to the other begins in the ambulances that rushed the brothers from their respective final showdowns with police in Watertown, Massachusetts, on April 19, 2013. Boston bombing survivor: I am not limiting myself . Tamerlan, dying from gunshot wounds and having been run over by the car his brother was driving as he fled, became combative in the ambulance. A paramedic testified Wednesday that it was common for patients in shock to become agitated and fight back. \"He had an abdominal wound, it was an evisceration,\" said paramedic Michael Sullivan. It was a \"penetrating wound,\" with the intestines protruding. \"Every time we tried hands-on, he resisted that type of treatment,\" Sullivan said. \"He was yelling, loud, like an 'rrrrrrrr' type of thing. It was like he was trying to get out of the seat belts that were holding him on\" the stretcher. Jahar, on the other hand, was cooperative after his capture hours later -- until a tourniquet was applied too tightly, said paramedic Laura Lee. He responded to questions, giving his date of birth and saying he was allergic to cats. And then he asked a question of his own: . \"Where is my brother?\" The defense showed a series of photographs that demonstrated how the brothers differed in size and age. The younger brother has been portrayed as someone who follows, rather than leads. One of Tamerlan's boxing coaches testified earlier that Jahar followed his brother around \"like a puppy.\" The defense asserts that the Boston Marathon bombings never would have happened if it weren't for Tamerlan. They have portrayed him as obsessed with jihad, spending hours in his computer trolling al Qaeda-style websites. An uncle in Russia told the FBI that Tamerlan came there in 2012, expecting to find \"jihad in the streets.\" Magomed Kartashov was questioned by the FBI after 40 days in a Russian jail. The FBI summary report of the interview was read in court. Kartashov said his nephew asked him if he had contacts with people \"in the forest,\" as locals referred to the jihadists. Tamerlan's information came from the Internet, but he had surprisingly little knowledge of Islam, the uncle told the FBI. When he asked his nephew why he wanted to go to the forest, he responded that \"jihad was necessary today,\" Kartashov told the FBI. \"I told him to stop or he wouldn't make it to the next tree.\" Jahar, on the other hand, was portrayed in the testimony of five of his former teachers as a smart, sweet kid who worked hard and earned good grades. He was \"super kind, extremely smart, a very hard worker, really a lovely person,\" said Tracey Gordon, his fifth-grade teacher at Cambridgeport School. \"All the teachers loved him,\" said Becki Norris, who had Jahar in her seventh-grade class at Community Charter School, a middle school in Cambridge known for setting its students on the path to \"full ticket\" scholarships to good colleges. \"He was one of our top students, and one of our top athletes,\" Norris said. \"He wasn't a rebel. If you asked him to do something, he'd do it. Like most middle-schoolers, he's need a little push, but he needed just one. \" But after just a few days in the ninth grade, Jahar's mother pulled him out of the school and sent him to Cambridge Rindge and Latin, a large public high school. She was angry that her son had been sent home to change out of his blue pants. \"She was very, very angry because he didn't have clean pants that matched the uniform and they didn't have the money,\" Norris said. \"I thought he liked the school, and I didn't think he wanted to go.\" Norris said she asked Jahar if she could call his mother. \"He flatly said, 'No, don't call her.' \" He made friends in high school, and a core group got together regularly for \"bro nights\" during their freshman year at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, two young women testified. They smiled at Tsarnaev from with witness stand, but while he seemed generally more animated in court, he maintained his usual flat expression. \"He was loyal, fun, laid-back,\" said classmate Tiarrah Dottin. She said she had no idea he was listening to jihadi songs or watching al Qaeda videos on his laptop. She bowed her head and wiped tears from her eyes as she stepped off the witness stand and took a seat in the audience. Alexa Guevara testified that Tsarnaev \"was private about his family,\" and did not discuss politics or religion with her. She said when he spoke about the future he said he planned to transfer to the University of Massachusetts Amherst and study marine biology. He was a supportive friend, she added. \"He encouraged me to go to art school,\" she said. She showed him her sketches, and he thought they were good. \"He said I had talent and shouldn't let it go to waste. I should go to art school and do what made me happy. It made me feel really good, like somebody believed in me,\" she said. She ended her testimony with a memory of one of the last times she saw Tsarnaev and the \"bros.\" It was March 2013, during spring break of their sophomore year. They went out to eat and then drove to a spot by the Charles River. \"Jahar went over to his car, and he got a backpack and there were fireworks inside,\" she recalled. \"He set one up and ignited it. It didn't work. The second one did work. We were all whooping and hollering. Jahar was jumping through the firework itself. He was being really silly.\" She sobbed as court recessed for the day, and her cries could be heard in the hallway outside the courtroom. Boston Marathon terror attack fast facts .

'People are checking their emails all the time, you do not have the same sort of quiet empty time that there used to be.'

This has squeezed out time we would have spent with our other halves. The statistician quotes Catherine Mercer, a researcher on the British National Survey, as saying: \u2018With an increasing number of competing demands on our time, sex just falls down our list of priorities.\u2019 She adds that dealing with work emails late in the evening can mean that \u2018come bedtime, we\u2019re just still too connected with everyone and everything out there to be able to focus just on our partner.\u2019\n"]}

Gary Barlow, Mark Owen and Howard Donald, who embark on their latest UK tour tomorrow, were told to pay back the cash 11 months ago after the 'investment' scheme they put millions into was ruled invalid. It is understood the trio are dealing directly with HMRC but have yet to stump up the cash. Scroll down for video . Fury: Take That members (from left) Gary Barlow, Howard Donald and Mark Owen have still not paid back the \u00a320million they owe the taxman, one year after they were ordered to. The band begin their UK tour tomorrow . A source close to the band said: 'They are not appealing the decision, they are dealing directly with HMRC.' The delay has been criticised by The Taxpayers' Alliance, with pressure mounting further by the fact that TV sports presenter Gabby Logan has already fulfilled her promise to pay back all the money she owed from the 'tax shelter' scheme, according to the\u00a0Sunday Mirror. Andy Silvester, campaign director, said: 'Everyone should play by the rules, and that means paying back on time if HMRC say so. 'However, the real moral of this story is that we desperately need to simplify the tax code to get rid of the loopholes that those with clever accountants can drive a Take That tour bus through. 'Politicians make an awful lot of noise about tax evasion and avoidance but are addressing the symptom rather than the cause.' The Take That trio have not appealed against last May's tax tribunal ruling that the Icebreaker scheme they paid millions of pounds into was created as a way of exploiting legal loopholes. Repaid: Other well-known clients who used the Icebreaker 'investment' scheme include TV sports presenter Gabby Logan (pictured right). Unlike Gary Barlow (left), she has already repaid everything she owed . Prime Minister David Cameron used a Take That lyric during Prime Minister's Questions, directed at Barlow, where he said 'We want your money back for good' as part of a pledge to get tax avoiders to return \u00a35billion . Money poured into Icebreaker, which used investment in the music industry to gain tax reliefs aimed at boosting the UK's creative industries, did not attract income tax. Icebreaker officials claimed that the initiative was funding music, supporting little-known artists to famous names such as Sinead O'Connor. But it was ruled by Judge Colin Bishopp that the scheme was mainly for tax avoidance rather than investments. Many of the 1,000 clients who invested in Icebreaker claimed they did not know the scheme broke any rules. David Cameron has previously used a Take That lyric during Prime Minister's Questions, directed at Barlow, where he said 'We want your money back for good' as part of a pledge to have \u00a35billion returned by tax avoiders. There is no suggestion Robbie Williams or Jason Orange took part in the Icebreaker scheme, which saw more than 7,000 repayment notices, totaling \u00a31.6billion, issued by HMRC as part of a crackdown.

A set of wheels broke off the Boeing 737 moments after it touched down at the airport, near Derby, causing the cargo plane to skid along the runway for 380ft before coming to a stop.

Still in Madrid\u2019s five-star Tivoli Lisboa hotel, the \u2018fat boy with the bowl full of Emilian tortellini\u2019 (his own words, not mine) told an Italian journalist friend: \u2018Yes we\u2019ve made history by winning La Decima \u2014 but this is Real Madrid. Lose two games next season and I\u2019ll still be an \u201cidiot\u201d.\u2019 Date: May 25, 2014. Hotel Address: Liberty Street, Lisbon. And of course Ancelotti was speaking after Madrid\u2019s two principal teams, sworn enemies, had contested the Champions League Final and he had lifted the \u2018cup with the big ears\u2019 for the fifth time as player or coach. Carlo Ancelotti is starting to feel the strain after recent poor results at Real Madrid . Ancelotti was a hero after guiding Real Madrid to their 10th European Cup triumph last year . Gareth Bale celebrates after scoring Real's second goal in extra time during the Lisbon final . Cristiano Ronaldo scored his team's fourth late in extra time to secure the famous victory .

Copa del Rey Last 16, First Leg . January 15 - Real 2-2 Atletico . Copa del Rey Last 16, Second Leg . February 7 - Atletico 4-0 Real . La Liga . Not that winning liberated him from the sad truth of his statement. Two games? His team have lost almost one out of every three matches in 2015 (six defeats in 19 outings). Worse is the fact that he is now a black smudge on Madrid\u2019s pristine-white history, having already lost to Atletico \u2014 the club which was unable to register a single win over Real between 1999 and 2013 \u2014 four times in a season. Perhaps worst of all, the European champions\u2019 utterly humiliating 4-0 defeat at the ferocious Calderon stadium last time these two met, just over two months ago, meant Atletico had won all three home \u2018derbis\u2019 by a 7-0 aggregate this term. In fact, during each of the seven defeats in 11 derbies Ancelotti has had to soak up as Madrid manager against Diego Simeone\u2019s bruising buccaneers, his team hasn\u2019t scored once. None of which make Ancelotti an idiot. Where they do, cumulatively, leave him is in perhaps the most embarrassing position of his career. Not because if he loses the imminent Champions League quarter-final against Spain\u2019s champions Ancelotti fears the sack. Cristiano Ronaldo sits dejected during Real's 4-0 La Liga defeat to Atletico back in February . Mario Mandzukic (left) celebrates with Fernando Torres after scoring in Atletico's 4-0 win in February . Like Norman Stanley Fletcher in Porridge, there are some penalties in his chosen profession which \u2018Carletto\u2019 (Wee Charlie) treats as an occupational hazard. You might argue that losing a 3-0 lead over Liverpool in Istanbul almost exactly a decade ago should constitute that moment of maximum embarrassment. Not so. Ancelotti not only famously doled out revenge on Rafa Benitez\u2019s team two years later \u2014 when Milan reached the 2007 final they watched the Liverpool v Chelsea second semi-final together, cheering and roaring for the Reds more hoarsely than any Koppite to go through so that history could be re-visited \u2014 he could also come to terms with the remarkable 3-3-and-penalties defeat. His view: \u2018My team did its very best to win. So I couldn\u2019t be angry. I think this was destiny. I\u2019ve managed nearly 900 matches in my career and two where my team played exceptionally well were that Istanbul final and the semi against Manchester United in 2007.\u2019 So this is a different red-and-white thorn in his side. Constant defeats during which Real Madrid have not, by any stretch, done their best. Things have, in fact, been getting incrementally worse. May\u2019s final in Lisbon was won the very second that Sergio Ramos made it 1-1 in the 93rd minute. Atletico were, almost literally, out on their feet. A rueful Ancelotti walks past the European Cup after Milan surrendered a three-goal lead against Liverpool . But Ancelotti made up for it by beating Liverpool in 2007 and gaining revenge for that defeat two years before . AC MILAN . UEFA Champions League 2002-03, 2006-07 . UEFA Super Cup 2003, 2007 .

Since then, it has been as if Simeone and Co have soaked up all the anger, all the humiliation, all the impotent rage they felt when Cristiano Ronaldo venerated his penalty goal (to kill an already dead match) for 4-1 with his \u2018I\u2019m actually the Incredible Hulk\u2019 celebration. In the drama of that night, and amidst the history of Madrid\u2019s tenth title, it's often forgotten that when Rafa Varane kicked the ball at Atletico\u2019s Argentinian manager with two minutes left in extra-time, Simeone chased him onto the pitch then had to be both restrained and persuaded to leave the playing surface before being sent off. Simeone, applauded out of the press conference later that night in appreciation of having won the Spanish title and of how heroically Atletico clung on to Diego Godin\u2019s headed lead in Lisbon, spoke kindly about Varane being \u2018just a kid\u2019 with \u2018a great future\u2019 in the post-match post-mortem. But, trust me, that was one of the spurs chafing at Simeone\u2019s skin all summer until the Spanish Supercup second leg when Varane was pressed, exposed for awareness and sharpness and Mario Mandzukic bagged the goal which started Atletico\u2019s winning run against Madrid this season. \u2018The most important, most intelligent player in every great team is usually a midfielder,\u2019 Ancelotti believes. Atletico manager Diego Simeone rushes on to confront Real defender Rafael Varane in the final . Simeone also had a go at referee Bjorn Kuipers as tempers boiled over during the last few minutes . Atletico were unable to hang on to the lead given to them by Diego Godin during the Lisbon final . He was one such, as was Simeone, plus Luis Enrique, Pep Guardiola (and Max Allegri at a far lower level) at four of the other eight Champions League quarter- finalists. However, as a coach, Carletto couldn\u2019t be more different from the breed represented by Simeone, \u2018Lucho\u2019 and Guardiola. And that\u2019s something else, other than Ancelotti\u2019s future employment with Madrid, which is at stake this week. From the moment when elite footballers, and then run-of-the-mill players, began to earn money per season which made them absolutely financially secure for life, the worth of the coach who is only authoritarian was at an end. If you can\u2019t \u2018convince\u2019 and \u2018enlist\u2019 your multi-millionaire squad at a club which is expected to win one, or more, of the great trophies each season, then you are dead in the water. But Guardiola, Mourinho and Simeone come from a school where they not only master the teaching, coaxing, convincing, but show ferocious authoritarian tendencies, too. \u2018My way or the high way\u2019 is something they not only dare to say to a player worth \u00a350m-plus, they believe it\u2019s their right. Ancelotti is built differently, having won 17 trophies as a coach seeking only intelligence, diligence and intensity of effort. He neither wants nor needs to instil fear, to make his players blind followers of a regimental doctrine \u2014 he actually treats them as responsible grown-ups. If his team act like novice kids at the Calderon on Tuesday, once again, then Ancelotti still won\u2019t be an idiot. But an endangered species \u2014 yes.\n"]}

The Home Secretary said new legislation was urgently needed to update the powers of MI5 and GCHQ, and repair the damage done by the US traitor Edward Snowden. But, based on current polling, Parliament would be left deadlocked \u2013 with the balance of power held by Scottish nationalists opposed to updating the law. Home secretary Theresa May (pictured) warned that lives will be in danger if Britain is saddled with a hung Parliament unable to pass anti-terror laws - adding new legislation for MI5 and GCHQ is urgently needed . She urged wavering Ukip supporters and the four in ten voters who say they are still undecided to realise what is at stake for Britain\u2019s security on May 7. The situation is made especially acute by a \u2018poison pill\u2019 inserted into emergency anti-terror laws passed last year. The legislation lapses next year. And if MPs cannot agree on a replacement, Britain\u2019s spies will be unable to properly track the communications of Islamic State and other terrorists. Mrs May said that, in the worst scenario, the decision would be in the hands of a minority Ed Miliband government propped up by the SNP \u2013 which is opposed to new data retention powers, . Her comments follow a controversial warning by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon that Labour might be unable to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on Nicola Sturgeon\u2019s SNP \u2013 as the polls say is highly likely. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (pictured) said Labour might be unable to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent if it is reliant on Sturgeon\u2019s SNP . Mr Fallon said that, having stabbed his brother in the back to get the Labour leadership, Mr Miliband may now do the same to his country over national security. However Mrs May insists that she is not using counter-terrorism as a \u2018political football\u2019 and the threat is real. She told the Mail: \u2018It is a matter of very real concern to me. There is a concern where we have a hung Parliament where it is difficult to get legislation through or a Labour government that is propped up by the SNP. \u2018Decisions will need to be taken about the capabilities we need and the one party that is committed to ensuring the security agencies and law enforcement have the powers that we need is the Conservative party.\u2019 Mrs May delivered her warning in an exclusive interview with the Mail during a tour of marginal seats in the North and the Midlands. In a question and answer session with sixth formers in Bury, she was asked by a student what her opinion was of Snowden \u2013 who leaked millions of documents exposing sensitive spying techniques. In her most forthright comments yet, Mrs May replied: \u2018As a result of what he has done, it has become more difficult for our security agencies to do the job they need to do to keep us safe. He has potentially put lives at risk.\u2019 The anti-terror law due to expire next year is the Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act, passed as emergency legislation in 2014. It gives security officials access to a treasure trove of communications data collected and stored by mobile phone and internet companies. This includes information on who you call, when, for how long and roughly where you were at the time. It is used for checking alibis, tracing kidnap victims and \u2013 in the case of terrorists \u2013 identifying and tracking plots. Security agencies say that without it, fanatics will be far harder to monitor and lives will be in danger. In the wake of the Snowden controversy, some technology firms have been reluctant to help the security services. Officials say the leaks by Snowden, made to the Guardian, have been a gift for terrorists. Despite the threat posed by jihadis returning from Syria, security has so far played no significant role in the election campaign. Mrs May will hope her intervention sharpens minds with less than a week to go.\n"]}

But the consumption of locusts, crickets, worms and grubs could become very much a part of our diet as the cost of meat production rises, and the demand for meat grows. In tonight's final episode of BBC Two's Back In Time For Dinner, the Robshaws \u2013 Brandon, 53, Rochelle, 52, and their children Miranda, 17, Rosalind, 15 and Fred \u2013 who have travelled from the 1950s to the end of the millennium are served the food of the future. The Robshaws sample insects in tonight's episode of\u00a0BBC Two's Back for Dinner . Two billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with insects . The experiment, filmed for a six-part TV programme, ended with the family feeling extremely grateful for the variety of foods available today. Presenter Giles Coren and food historian Polly Russell serve the family a radical dinner of Mexican spiced cricket tacos, Asian worm stir fry, buffalo worm tart and cricket kebabs. The family also attempt burgers made with a mixture of insect and beef protein, and sample cookies made from insect flour. 'In the future meat supplies might be a problem,' presenter Mr Coren says in the programme. 'Insects have been hailed as a solution to our meat problem; full of protein, low in fat and packed full of nutrients they are already part of the staple diet in parts of Africa and Asia.' The lack of traditional meat proteins can be put down to population expansion, food historian Polly Russell explains. 'As populations grow globally there is a huge pressure on the amount of meat that is produced because as developing countries start getting richer and people start adopting Western-style diets, which tend to consume a lot more meat,' she said. Entomophagy (eating insects) could have a positive impact on the environment and world hunger if crunchy exoskeletons could replace typical meat. Throughout the show, in the 1950s the children had to wait patiently for their father to finish his dinner, knowing his leftovers would be their supper. The 1960s saw the birth of the sugary cereal, while motorway service stations became almost fashionable as places to eat. The Robshaws found that food in the 1970s was brightly-coloured - but perhaps less enticing - than before . In the 1970s, working women were learning to balance their careers with cooking for the family. The decade also saw the rise of the Pot Noodle. In the 1980s goats cheese, mange tout and kiwi fruit became the foods to impress your dinner party guests. Gourmet dishes and nouvelle cuisine took over from the simple but hearty dishes of earlier decades. By the 1990s, sushi and curry were as popular as traditional English dishes and ready meals became the norm. For the final episode, the family discussed the food of the future; insects. On top of health benefits, insects are seen as a solution to meet the demands of food supply and are viewed as a more environmentally-friendly method of food production. A recent UN report identified edible insects as a sustainable food source for the future. Figures indicate two billion people worldwide already supplement their diet with them. And once better technology has been developed for farming insects, they really have better potential of becoming a major food source, experts say. Chef Rene Redzepi's pop-up restaurant Noma Tokyo has a menu that begins with a starter of prawns and ants . Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca, which was co-founded in 2007 by Masterchef winner Thomasina Miers, started to introduce the alternate protein source to diners in 2013. In January this year, it brought chapulines fundido to the menu, made with one of Mexico's most sustainably farmed, yet unusual ingredients - grasshoppers. Chefs cook the fried chapulines (grashoppers) with softened shallots, garlic and smoky chipotle chillies to create a salsa, which is served with queso fundido, a mixture of grated mozzarella and cheddar cheese and a side of corn tortillas. Thomasina Miers gave FEMAIL her take on the dish. She said: 'It's just not in our psyche at the moment, but we don't have any issues eating shrimps or prawns, so I think it's just a question of creating a dish that will appeal over here. Mexican restaurant chain Wahaca served\u00a0chapulines fundido - made with  grasshoppers - to its menu in January this year . Archipelago restaurant in Cleveland Street has love bug salads, bushmans's caviar (caramel mealworms, blinis, coconut cream and vodka jelly) and a dessert called Medieval Hive (brown butter ice-cream, honey and butter caramel sauce and a baby bee) on the menu. This summer chef Adam Holcroft will open Britain's first insect restaurant in Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, this summer, serving dishes which feature crickets, bugs and worms. The 37-year-old head chef says it will be the first restaurant in the UK dedicated to serving insects as protein to show  bugs can help feed the booming global population. Asian Forest Scorpion - Scorpions have a strong, bitter flavor and are normally eaten with sweet chili sauce. Paris Street Rose is full of rich sweet fruit made from full bodied Transylvanian Pinot Noir, so it will have enough body to cut through the combination of flavours. Mealworms - Match their nutty taste and light, crunchy texture with a crisp Clare Valley Viognier wine that has just the right combination of fruit and richness. Zebra Tarantula - Tarantulas are normally eaten deep fried, so think similar to fish and chips. A lively full bodied Chardonnay will stand up to the complex fishy flavours of the tarantula. Sago Worms - These worms have a distinct taste a bit similar to bacon so you need a big meaty red with loads of punch to match that savoury flavour. McLaren Vale Shiraz is fresh with loads of red fruit and spice . BBQ Locusts - Locusts taste a bit like an exotic bar snack and with the BBQ flavour you'll need a wine with a hint of sweetness. The Hacienda de Lluna Moscatel is a gorgeous lightly bubbly pink that works well as an aperitif. Chocolate dipped locusts - These locusts are essentially a savory dish as they taste a bit like sunflower seeds, but also have the sweetness from the chocolate. A rich robust wine with loads of sweet fruit will stand up to these flavours. Giant Waterbugs - The meat inside the water bug's body tastes a bit similar to a sweet scallop, while the head has hints of anise, so you'll need to find a wine that can match well with seafood and stronger flavours. A dry sherry, and a Fino at that, is the only choice here. The crisp citrus and nutty flavours will complement their complex flavours. Queen Weaver Ants - Their slightly sour and crunchy tastes like a lemon. They would go well with an aromatic white with pretty fruit and floral notes.

The average length of a 'romp' between two pandas is between 30 seconds and five minutes, making Lu Lu's efforts all the more impressive. Breeders said they watch the creatures having sex so they can understand their mating habits, and encourage them to reproduce in the future. A breeder at the Sichuan Giant Panda Research Centre watches close as Lu Lu and Zhen Zhen begin . They use poles made of bamboo to guide the pandas towards each other, when they have tracked when the pandas are in the amorous mood. The female of the species are prone to making loud and strange noises, while male pandas leave traces of their scent to attract the opposite sex. But timing is everything, because the female pandas are in heat once a year, for between two to four days. Mating season for pandas usually begins in March and lasts until May, according to a report by the Shanghaiist.

Here he gives his insight into what caused the blaze. It was a day I have often tried to forget, but it was the one I must always remember. Approaching the 30th anniversary of the Bradford City fire, it was inevitable I would be asked to recall the horrific images from a match I was commentating on for Yorkshire Television. What I did not expect was for someone to suggest the fire may not have been an accident, as Martin Fletcher has done with his book Fifty-Six, the Story of the Bradford Fire. The tragic fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade stadium claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . Martin lost three generations of his family and has a right to speak his mind \u2014 any bitterness would be understandable \u2014 but from everything I have been told there isn\u2019t a jot of evidence to suggest the blaze was caused deliberately. On the contrary, I remember the coroner telling me it was obvious how the fire had started. Detective Inspector Raymond Falconer actually identified a man who had dropped a lit cigarette that went down a hole in the stand and started the fire. This corroborates what I was told at the time by the coroner. He said it was believed the fire had been started by a man, visiting this country from Australia, but his name was never revealed. Without making allegations against the club\u2019s chairman at the time Stafford Heginbotham, there is inference by implication in the book \u2014 with reference to a series of fires at factories owned by the now deceased Heginbotham. As members of his own family were seated in the stand that day, and as it was due to be demolished anyway 48 hours later, it is unfathomable to think there could have been an act of arson. I find it abhorrent that Stafford Heginbotham\u2019s family are being subjected to this unseemly inference at a time when people are still grieving and paying their respects three decades on from the most horrendous day of their lives. There isn\u2019t a shred of evidence to suggest anything other than a terrible human tragedy. It should also never be forgotten that Heginbotham twice saved Bradford City from extinction. As son James said to me: \u2018He put that club above everything else, including family and business.\u2019 A memorial at Valley Parade pays tribute those who died  in the devastating blaze almost 30 years ago . We all have our memories of a day that still sends a shudder up my spine. I cannot bear to watch the footage. If I hear my voice describing the tragedy as it unfolded I have to leave the room. Many of the 54 Bradford and two Lincoln fans who lost their lives, choked to death with inhalation of fumes. The smell was of acrid tar. As a Bradfordian myself I knew many of those fleeing for their lives, as I attempted to describe the scenes without becoming over-emotional.

He may now be looking for a new job. 'If Hillary Clinton can't satisfy her husband,' a Texas-cowgirl college student tweeted, 'what makes her think she can satisfy America?' When someone retweeted the quip two hours later and included Trump's Twitter handle in the message, one of the billionaire's staffers retweeted it for him \u2013 to his audience of 2.8 million people. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . THE INTERNET IS FOREVER: A social media staffer to Donald Trump retweeted an off-color jab at Hillary Clinton on Thursday before the boss deleted it . Trump, a multibillionaire who's considering a presidential run, will be in New Hampshire on Saturday \u2013 where the episode will likely come up . SATISFIED? Bill Clinton (left) was a famous lothario during his presidency, even carrying on one affair with a White House intern . Time elapsed: Less than three hours. His office confirmed on Friday that it was a Trump employee, not a fat-fingered CEO, who was responsible. 'Mr. Trump was not responsible for this tweet,' a spokesperson told Daily Mail Online. 'It was retweeted by one of ten staff members that periodically help execute on Mr. Trump\u2019s various social media platforms.' 'As soon as Mr. Trump saw the tweet he deleted it,' the spokesperson added. Hillary Clinton's once-strained relationship with her philandering husband isn't likely to be the stuff of TV ads in the 2016 presidential race, but the tweet suggests an undercurrent of crude jokes are being made at her expense. Sawyer Burmeister, a Texas equestrian champion, originated the line about Hillary Clinton's alleged inability to 'satisfy' her randy husband Bill . Bill Clinton, the 42nd U.S. president, had an affair with a White House intern named Monica Lewinsky. He also famously caroused with other women who were not his wife, going back to his days as the governor of Arkansas. A recent book about the staff who run the White House residence recounted a butler's story about hearing HIllary throw an object at him during the height of the Lewinsky saga. Taylor Burmeister, who wrote the tweet about Hillary failing to satisfy Bill, deleted it just before noon on Friday, along with a second message. 'Sry to those offended by me merely making a political joke,' she had tweeted in a follow-up. 'Get some rest, there are more important things in the world to be worried about.' She assured Daily Mail Online in an email that no one fro, the Trump camp had asked her to delete the tweets. 'I deleted them by choice because of the negative backlash I was receiving,' she said. 'I didn't even know Donald Trump had retweeted it until about an hour ago.' Burmeister confirmed to Daily Mail Online that she had deleted her tweets because of a nasty backlash . She originally offered an apology to people who were offended, but it apparently wasn't enough for some . Burmeister is no stranger to media attention. A world champion equestrian, she also had a bit part last year in an episode of the reboot of the 'Dallas' TV drama. And she's a pre-law student studying criminal justice at\u00a0Tarleton State University in Texas, according to her social media profiles. Trump's retweet might have disappeared if a snarky Twitter user hadn't made a screen capture on his phone. 'Hey @RealDonaldTrump \u2013 In case you're looking for that tweet you deleted,' he wrote, 'I got it right here.' Hillary Clinton's campaign did not respond to requests for comment.\n"]}
{"question_id": 291, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: On May 23, 2010, bride-to-be Rachelle Friedman was pushed into a pool. Breaking her neck, she was instantly paralyzed from the neck down. As paramedics rushed around her, friends wept, and her fianc\u00e9 frantically phoned from three hours away, Rachelle had one question:\u00a0Could she still have kids? 'It was the first thing I thought of,' Rachelle told DailyMail.com. 'I had no idea what was going to happen to me, or what was going on. But ever since I fell in love with Chris I wanted to have babies with him. When I fell in the pool and they were saying things like \"paralyzed\", I didn't know if I'd be able to carry a child.' Fast-forward half a decade, that question has been answered. Rachelle and Chris Chapman will welcome their baby girl into the world on April 18, thanks to an old friend who asked them to let her be their surrogate. Scroll down for video . Moving: Rachelle Friedman Chapman and her husband Chris (together in the background) are days from becoming parents as their surrogate and college friend Laurel Humes (foreground) reaches her due date . Excited: Rachelle can physically carry children but her blood pressure is too low. So Laurel, whose husband and son are pictured (left), offered to carry the child for them . The baby will be born near Laurel's home in Asheville, North Carolina, four hours from the Chapmans . Rachelle hadn't seen Laurel for nine years but Laurel, touched by her story, reached out on Facebook . Chris and Rachelle confessed they are nervous but excited to welcome the girl, whose name they won't reveal . 'We are both so excited,' Rachelle said. 'Everything has gone so fast. The baby could come any minute now so we've got a bag ready, and the nursery is almost all done. It's amazing.' Though quadriplegic, Rachelle, 29, is able to conceive and carry a child. Her condition means all four of her limbs are impaired, not strictly paralyzed. However, the accident left her with uniquely low blood pressure. Unable to stop taking the medication, which could be damaging to a fetus, she and Chris, 32, started exploring other options. She wrote a blog post on her website about contemplating surrogacy - and a friend from college, Laurel Humes, got in touch. 'I couldn't believe it. I met Laurel at college through Chris but she was a bit older than me and graduated that year. So I hadn't spoken to her in about nine years. 'After I wrote that post, she sent me a Facebook message saying she had been following our story and would love to be our surrogate. Then it all just went so fast. And Laurel has just been so so great.' Rachelle and Chris flew from their home in Raleigh, North Carolina, to Surrogacy Together in California to be assessed and start the process. Half a decade's difference: Rachelle and Chris pictured (left) before she fell into a pool on during her bachelorette party. Now, Rachelle and Laurel (right) have reached a situation neither anticipated . They have built a crib which Rachelle can wheel under, and turned Chris's man cave into a nursery . This is the ultrasound picture of the baby. Chris, Rachelle and Laurel all went to the ultrasound together . Despite the narrow odds, they conceived after the first try. Since then, Laurel has been carrying the child at her home on a farm in Asheville, North Carolina - a four-hour drive from the Chapmans. They admit it's not ideal. 'Unfortunately we haven't had that much time with Laurel and the baby,' Rachelle explains. 'Obviously, as a woman, you want to carry your child. You start to develop those motherly instincts, and the father develops fatherly feelings. 'For both of us it will be a different experience. We haven't had that time with the baby, then one day we're going to come home with a baby. 'It becomes more real when we are around her, when we go to visit. We were at the ultrasounds and she came to the baby shower.' Chris said he never contemplated that their wedding wouldn't go ahead after Rachelle fell . The pair have been dedicated to publicizing their situation to increase awareness about quadriplegia . But everything is in order. They have built a wheelchair-friendly crib that lets Rachelle wheel herself under it. Aside from some pictures on the wall, the nursery - formerly Chris's 'man cave' - is looking baby-ready. The name, though still secret, is set ('I let Chris pick!'). They even traveled over to Laurel's farm on Easter Sunday to take a glowing set of maternity pictures. As Chris remarks, however, 'no matter how much you prepare, you have no idea how to handle it. 'After Rachelle's accident, it took time for us to learn how to deal with it, and we dealt with it differently. 'With this, we are on a level playing field: neither of us know what's coming. And that's the fun of it.' Laurel's due date is April 18, the day after Chris, a teacher, finishes school. However, her own son was born two weeks early, so they're prepared for a rush to make the four-hour drive to the hospital, where they will have their own room. 'When I was getting married I obviously had no idea it was going to happen this way,' Rachelle said. 'But I think we're ready. And we're so excited.'\n"]}

But one researcher has come up with a novel idea that could trump them all - a biological solar panel that works around the clock. By harnessing the electrons generated by plants such as moss, he said he can create useful energy that could be used at home or elsewhere. A University of Cambridge scientist has revealed his green source of energy. By using just moss he is able to generate enough power to run a clock (shown). He said panels of plant material could power appliances in our homes. And the technology could help farmers grow crops where electricity is scarce . Dr Paolo Bombelli will present his research as part of the Pint of Science festival, which is running from 18 to 20 May in 50 cities across nine countries. His idea is relatively simple - by wiring up plants to an electro-chemical system, he is able to harness the waste electrons and energy produced during the photosynthesis process. And the results are surprisingly efficient. He demonstrated how a smartphone-sized block of moss could be used to power a digital clock. The Pint of Science festival is taking place from Monday 18 to Wednesday 20 May 2015. It sees scientists of various disciplines give talks in pubs around the world, with topics ranging from the brain to space, that the public can attend for \u00a33 - the \u2018price of a pint\u2019. Dr Paolo Bombelli, with his moss-powered clock, is one of the scientists taking part. This year more than 600 science evenings will take place in 50 cities across nine countries. Cities in the UK include Bristol, London, Manchester and Southampton. A full schedule can be found on their website. An A4-sized area of leaves - about 93 square inches (600 square centimetres) - could charge four AA batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day. Dr Bombelli said his inspiration came from the movie The Matrix. \u2018In that movie, they try to generate electrical energy, power, from humans,\u2019 he explained. \u2018And although it was a bit crude, the concept is actually correct. \u2018But there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans.\u2019 The apparatus required is also relatively simple - cables, some water and a plant. At the moment, Dr Bombelli is trying to find a way to increase the \u2018flux\u2019 of electrons emitted by a plant, making more energy available. \u2018If we can crack this, we can get a very large flux of electrons coming out, then we can build a biological solar panel,\u2019 he told MailOnline. Dr Bombelli said his inspiration came from the 1999 movie The Matrix. \u2018In that movie, they try to generate electrical energy, power, from humans,\u2019 he explained, shown in this image from the movie. 'But there are perhaps less ethical issues if you take electrons from photosynthetic organisms than humans' An A4-sized area of leaves - about (93 square inches (600 square centimetres) - could charge four AA batteries in one hour on a typical sunny day. The ultimate goal is to develop panels that generate five watts per square metre (11 square ft). By comparison, a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre . Dr Paolo Bombelli  presented his research at a preview  of the Pint of Science festival (left). He is adamant that regular moss (stock image right) could provide an additional source of renewable energy to complement others that are available . For example, he said people could have one of these panels on the roof of their house to power certain appliances in their home. The goal is to generate up to five watts per square metre (11 square feet). By comparison, a solar panel generates 150 to 200 watts per square metre. The uses are not just in the home, though.\u00a0Dr Bombelli said in regions where people don\u2019t have access to energy, biological solar panels could be useful for tasks such as growing crops. People could be shown how to build the simple systems and, unlike solar panels which require technical expertise to fix, the biological solar panels can be fixed easily. \u2018To assemble one is not too difficult,\u2019 he explained. And to demonstrate just how useful the technology can be, Dr Bombelli is gearing up to deploy a plant-powered system in London Zoo. A trap camera powered by moss will be installed in the next four to eight weeks, and ultimately the same camera could be used to capture images of animals in the wild. Rice farming is one area Dr Bombelli sees his technology being useful. It could help power technology in areas where electricity is scarce, possibly increasing yields. Shown is a stock image of rice paddy fields in India, one region Dr Bombelli said his technology could be useful . He noted that there are limitations: the technology is not very mobile, and its power output is low compared to other renewable energies. Nonetheless he thinks it could be part of a \u2018portfolio of renewable technology\u2019 to generate electricity. \u2018We don\u2019t really think the world is going to be powered by this technology, but it could play a role,\u2019 he said.\n"]}

Stoll, who will make a cameo in the upcoming film version of the popular HBO show Entourage, was booked into the Clark County Detention Center and was listed as having a hearing on Saturday after posting $5,000 bail. The charges include possession of Class 1, 2, 3 and 4 controlled substances, including cocaine and ecstasy. Michael Pariente, a Las Vegas criminal defense lawyer, says that Stoll will likely be offered a plea deal as a first time offender. Speaking with TSN, he said; 'It's pretty much a slap on the wrist. Even if he was going to represent himself they'd make him an offer like this.' This would include a $1,000 fee, an online drug awareness course, and possibly community service.

But while Weinstein has spoken to police and denied the accusations, a recorded conversation between him and Battilana shows he did not deny the incident, it has been claimed. 'He didn't deny doing what she said he did to her,' the source told the\u00a0New York Daily News. 'The content of the phone call, there's no question about what he did.' See below for video . Out and about: Harvey Weinstein is pictured leaving his New York townhouse on Thursday, nearly a week after he allegedly groped a model.  He voluntarily spoke with authorities and is cooperating with their investigation . Accusations: Italian model Ambra Battilana, 22, told police that the Hollywood producer groped her and put his hand up her skirt during a 'business meeting' at his Tribeca office in Manhattan on Friday night . DailyMail.com has reached out to his representatives for comment. She also convinced him to meet him a restaurant and the NYPD were also there to watch that meeting, according to the newspaper. It is not clear if he knew he was being monitored but following the call and the meeting at the restaurant at the Tribeca Grand Hotel, Weinstein voluntarily went to speak with police on Saturday. He requested a lawyer and has promised full cooperation with the probe. The alleged incident unfolded at Weinstein's Tribeca office after he invited her there for a business meeting on Friday night, hours after meeting her at Radio City Music Hall on Thursday night. When she arrived at the office, the married father-of-five allegedly asked if her breasts were real before touching them and putting his hand up her skirt, she told police. He also asked her for a kiss, she claimed. She clearly rejected him and he backed off, the New York Daily News reported, and she fled from the building. Security footage shows the model speaking on the phone as she quickly left the building half an hour after arriving, the newspaper reported. Model: Battilana (pictured) claims he assaulted her at his office on Friday after meeting him at a red carpet event on Thursday night. Afterwards, she called police and they monitored a phone conversation with him . Beauty queen: Battilana is pictured left during the Miss Italia contest in Rome in 2011 and right in 2010 . Under surveillance: Following the alleged incident, she arranged to meet with him at the restaurant of the Tribeca Grand Hotel (pictured) and the meeting was monitored by police, according to reports . The model's lawyer said his client was 'creeped out' by her alleged encounter with Weinstein, who is behind hit movies including Pulp Fiction, The King's Speech and Gangs Of New York. 'When she was describing what happened, her face became contorted,' said Mark Heller. 'It was that look of someone who was creeped out. She's a very young woman who was relating her disgust that a much older man - an old man in view of someone her age - conducted himself like that.' Weinstein could face misdemeanor charges of forcible touching or sexual abuse if the allegations are credible. No charges have been filed and his representatives say they believe he will be cleared. 'We are confident that we will be fully vindicated,' a Weinstein spokesman said. A source close to The Weinstein Company told Page Six the groping allegations were nothing more than a 'blackmail attempt' and insisted that the award-winning producer 'did nothing wrong'. Weinstein's camp have dismissed Miss Battilana as an opportunist with a sketchy past. It has emerged that Battilana previously told Italian authorities she witnessed a so-called 'bunga-bunga' orgy involving disgraced Italian prime minister Silvio Berlusconi at his Milan mansion in 2010. She claimed she had seen young models performing stripteases and baring their breasts to be kissed by the Italian leader during a raunchy dinner party. Weinstein has been married to his second wife, 38-year-old fashion designer Georgina Chapman, since 2007. The couple have two young children together . It also emerged that she told Italian police in 2010 that she was 'forced against' her will into having sex for money with a 70-year-old 'businessman of substantial means' when she was underage. Battilana met the wealthy car dealer in September 2009 when she was under 18 and therefore below the age of consent for prostitution in Italy, according to Italian newspaper reports. In her police statement, she said the man invited her into his car, where he then caressed 'my hand and left leg' and proposed 'that I become his 'playmate', she said. Battilana said he then gave her a bag with \u20ac2,000, before assuring her it was only 'an advance of the \u20ac5,000 he would give me every month'. She added: 'Despite the indecency of the proposal, both because of my psychological subjection in which I found myself and because of the severe poverty of my family I felt forced against my will not to refuse the money.' The relationship ended after she was accepted into the Miss Italia 2010 pageant. Prosecutors in Italy asked for the rape allegation to be dismissed in 2012 but it was not reported whether the judge granted the dismissal - although it is likely it would have been carried out. In 2012, the Alba prosecutor told Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera that Miss Battilana never showed up to talk to them about her police complaint so they were unable to verify her claims. The alleged groping took place on Friday at the Weinstein Company offices in Manhattan (pictured) where Battilana had met Harvey Weinstein to 'discuss business' After becoming famous through the Miss Italia pageant, Battilana began modeling professionally in 2011, according to social media. She works internationally in Milan, London, Paris and New York. She recently shot an editorial campaign for Bambi magazine in Agent Provocateur lingerie. Weinstein, who is originally from Queens, New York, founded Miramax studio with his brother Bob in 1979 and is worth an estimated $200 million. He is married to British-born fashion designer Georgina Chapman, 38, who founded the luxury label Marchesa. The couple have been together for seven years and have a young son and daughter. Weintein also has three older daughters from his first marriage to his former assistant, Eve Chilton, which ended in 2004.\n"]}

The landlord of the house, a 32-year-old Spanish man with a history of psychological problems, has been arrested. Adriana Giogiosa was reported missing by her brother after he was unable to contact her, and Ms Giogiosa's landlord in Madrid has been arrested in connection with her disappearance and a meat grinder found there . Spanish Police are said to have found blood and an industrial meat grinder at the property in a quiet street, as well as a list of three other tenants who are also thought to be missing. At least two of the other missing tenants are thought to be women from Argentina and the man's aunt has also not been found - prompting fears they could all have been murdered. When they searched the house in Sacedilla Street in Majadahonda officers found half of it had been repainted and the other half covered in plastic, ready for redecorating, El Pais reported. At first the man had refused officers access to the house and demanded they get a warrant. Spanish Police found a couple of spots of blood in the house, a meat grinder and what appeared to be a tooth in the machine. A blood stained knife was also found. These have all been sent off for analysis. Police launched an investigation after Miss Giogiosa's brother reported her missing on April 6. She had visited home in Argentina in February and caught a flight back to Madrid at the end of March, when she is believed to have been killed. Her brother said after he arrived back in Madrid he had received text messages from her saying she would be unable to speak because she was moving country and he had not been able to contact her - despite usually talking on a daily basis. The house in a quiet Majadahonda street has been searched by police, who reportedly found a meat grinder .

A man who boasted about plans for an armed robbery on Facebook minutes before he threatened staff in Tesco has been jailed for four years. Andrew Hennells posted details of his plan to the social networking site - stating he was 'Doing. Tesco. Over' at 7.25pm on February 13. A quarter of an hour later, Norfolk Police were alerted by a member of the public to a man brandishing a knife demanding cash from staff working at the supermarket giant's King's Lynn branch. Hennells fled the scene before police arrived, but he was quickly arrested in a nearby pub with \u00a3410 in stolen cash. Norfolk Crown Court heard that officers also recovered a knife. Last month, the 31-year-old, of Gaywood, King's Lynn,admitted\u00a0robbery and carrying a knife as an offence. Sentencing him to four years in prison for armed robbery today, judge Anthony Bate said Hennells posed a 'high risk of serious harm to the public'. The court heard how armed police were deployed after the alarm was raised. Hennells had escaped after stealing a car belonging to a retired couple who had stopped to use a cashpoint. But officers tracked him down in a nearby pub, finding him carrying a knife and \u00a3410 in stolen cash. Another count of robbery relating to the car-jacking was left to lie on file, Norfolk Police said. Outside court, Sgt Pete Jessop, from King's Lynn CID, said that the Facebook confession made it easier to prove the case. Hennells posted this message only 15 minutes before threatening staff at Tesco's in King's Lynn . A member of the public alerted police to a man threatening a member of staff in the store (pictured) Hennells, 31, was then found by police in a nearby pub, with \u00a3410 in cash on his person . Speaking after the first hearing, Sgt Jessop had said: 'We have not got to the bottom of why he posted the pictures and words on Facebook, or why he did the job in the first place. 'It was bizarre and an unusual set of circumstances. 'While the message and pictures on Facebook did not solve the case, it did confirm what we already knew. Hennells held up staff at the Tesco store in King's Lynn, pictured on Friday, February 13 . 'But the thing that made it easier and quicker for us to solve the case was the assistance from the public. 'However, the quickness does not take away from its seriousness or how traumatic it was for the victims of the robbery.' Hennells made a series of other posts to Facebook in the hours before the robbery, including a picture of a large knife, and sharing a Bare Knuckles Gypsies' 'The hardest man in Ireland' video.\n"]}

Jefferson County Circuit Judge Laura Petro on Thursday dismissed the case against Anthony Ray Hinton. The district attorney's office told the judge Wednesday that their forensic experts couldn't determine if six crime scene bullets \u2014 which were the crux of the evidence against Hinton at an expected retrial \u2014 came from a gun investigators took from his home. Hinton was convicted of two 1985 murders that occurred during robberies of fast-food restaurants near Birmingham. Prosecutors linked Hinton to the killings through a .38-caliber revolver found at his house. Couldn't match the bullets: Anthony Ray Hinton, pictured this week, spent nearly 30 years on Alabama's death row but will be freed Friday morning after prosecutors told a judge they won't re-try him for two slayings . All smiles: Anthony Ray Hinton hugs his family members  after learning he will walk free after spending 30 years behind bars . The U.S. Supreme Court last year sent Hinton's case back for a potential new trial, which prompted a re-examination of the evidence. 'We've been hoping for this. We've believed that this should have happened,' said Bryan Stevenson, Hinton's attorney and director of the Alabama-based Equal Justice Initiative. The Jefferson County District attorney's office could not immediately be reached for comment. Stevenson has been arguing for 16 years that Hinton was innocent and that he was at his job at a warehouse when the crimes were committed. Hinton wept Wednesday night after learning the news that he would finally go free, Stevenson said. A spokesman for the Alabama Department of Corrections said Hinton is expected to be released from the Jefferson County Jail on Friday morning. 'Every day, every month, every year that the state took from him, they took something that they don't have the power to give back. While this moment is quite joyous and is quite wonderful, this case is quite tragic,' Stevenson said. At his initial trial, state experts testified that the four bullets fired during the robberies, and another two from a similar robbery-shooting at a Quincy's restaurant in Bessemer, had all been fired from a revolver found at Hinton's home. Going free: Former death row inmate Anthony Ray Hinton, pictured in an undated older mugshot and an undated more recent mugshot, will go free on Friday after being imprisoned for 30 years . The Supreme Court last year ruled that Hinton had 'constitutionally deficient' representation at his initial trial. Hinton's defense lawyer wrongly thought he had only $1,000 to hire a ballistics expert to try to rebut the prosecution evidence, according the court opinion. Hinton's lawyer hired the only person willing to take the job at that price, even though he had concerns about the expert's credentials. 'He was a poor person who was convicted because he didn't have the money to prove his innocence at trial. He was unable to get the legal help he needed for years. He was convicted based on bad science,' Stevenson said. Chief Deputy Jefferson County District Attorney John Bowers met with the families of the victims of the shooting and they were angered by the news. 'Understandably they were upset and frustrated by the news. But ultimately they understood why we couldn't proceed with the prosecution of these cases,' Bowers said. 'There's no closure one way or the other,' he added. 'The experts did not say it did come from the pistol or that it didn't come from the pistol.' 'It's never happened in all my years of prosecution,' Bowers said told AL.com of releasing a death row inmate. New beginning: Anthony Ray Hinton, pictured this week, had improper representation 30 years ago because he was poor, said his attorney . The experts were unable to tie Hinton's gun to the bullets used at the crime scene. 'Three highly-qualified and experienced ADFS forensic scientists, who are experts in the field of firearms and tool mark identification, each performed independent forensic examinations of the submitted bullets and firearm,' the motion to dismiss charges said. 'Utilizing comparison microscopy, each expert inter-compared all six bullets recovered during the investigations of the three crimes to each other and to bullets test fired through the barrel of the firearm taken from (Hinton's) home.' Bowers said that the experts who examined the gun did not find enough evidence to prove Hinton's involvement. 'Due to insufficient corresponding individual microscopic characteristics, all three experts found that they could not conclusively determine that any of the six bullets were or were not fired through the same firearm or that they were fired through the firearm recovered from (Hinton's home),' \u00a0the motion continues. 'The only potential evidence that has ever been available to the State to prove that the Defendant committed the murders of John Davidson and Thomas Wayne Vason depends upon an absolute, conclusive determination that the bullets recovered from their bodies were in fact fired through the barrel of the firearm taken from the (Hinton's) home,' the motionsays. 'Based on the microscopic comparisons and conclusions of all three of the ADFS firearms and tool mark identification experts, the State does not have sufficient evidence to warrant further prosecution of these cases.'\n"]}

A popular  graduate fell to his death from a bedroom window in the Swiss Alps after playing drinking games, an inquest heard. Jake Shaw was just beginning his gap year - volunteering as a climbing instructor at Kandersteg International Scout Centre\u00a0- when the tragedy occurred last year. The 21-year-old had fallen\u00a025ft (8m) from the upper floor of the building in the early hours of August 1. He was airlifted to hospital in Bern suffering severe injuries but died nine days later. Lincoln Coroner's Court heard that shortly before his death, Jake had been celebrating the Swiss National Day with friends with drinking games called 'Power Hour' and 'Ring of Fire.' After consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at the centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a 'very drunk state'. It is then believed he lost his balance as he tried to open a bedroom window and toppled out of the window at the adventure camp in Interlaken, Switzerland. Today Lincolnshire Central assistant coroner Paul Smith, concluded that Jake's death was an accident. He said: 'The level of alcohol in his body was consistent with 11 standard drinks. 'It's the presumption that he was undeniably very drunk that evening - how that affected his balance is a matter of speculation. 'The most likely explanation is that in his state he took himself to bed, opened the window and perhaps overbalanced and fell.\u00a0'I'm satisfied that this was a tragic accident.' The court heard how in the game 'Power Hour', participants have to drink a shot of beer every minute for an hour and if completed two and a half litres of beer is consumed. A police report read out during the inquest, added: 'Examinations indicated that the August 1 celebrations were followed by a private party which Jake had attended. 'There were group games with drinks in the staff room. Jake had probably drank a large amount of mainly beer. After consuming a large amount of beer in the staff room at Kandersteg International Scout Centre he returned to his room at around 2.45am in a 'very drunk state'. Shortly before his death, adventure-loving Jake had been celebrating the Swiss National Day with friends with drinking games called 'Power Hour' and 'Ring of Fire' 'At some time after 2.45am he came away in an alcoholised state without letting anyone know where he was going. 'It must be presumed he returned to his room. How the fall happened can't be established in any detail.' Jake, from Welton, Lincolnshire had graduated with a maths degree from Sheffield University and had just started a gap year at the time of his death. The keen mountaineer and skier was planning to spend the winter season in the nearby French Alps. His devastated parents, Ian, 51, and Fiona Shaw, 52, wrote a joint statement about their son which was read out during the inquest. In it they said: 'Jake was intelligent, reliable, easy going and a loveable young man. He loved life, his friends and his family, and his passions were music and climbing. 'He had plans for next year mapped out to live life to the full . 'We are happy he was having a great time in the place he loved.' Jake, who loved the outdoors, was just beginning his gap year by volunteering as a climbing instructor when the tragedy occurred . The keen mountaineer and skier was planning to spend the winter season in the nearby French Alps before his tragic death . At the time of his death mother Fiona, a speech and language therapist, said: 'Jake was very gifted, the best son in the world who became my rock - he was dependable and made me laugh. 'He was intelligent and very funny, with a dry sense of humour. 'Although Jake was taken from us at only 21, they were great years and Jake was fortunate to have had so many marvellous experiences and done so much in his life.' Ian, a human resources manager, added: 'We are a very close family and we are all so proud of Jake. 'The countless messages we have received from his wide circle of friends have made us realise just how popular and loved by others he was. 'Jake was an avid reader and he really knew what was going on in the world.. He followed loads of sports, especially football, cycling and cricket. 'He did things I never achieved through his mountaineering trips abroad and we followed his achievements with pride. I'll really miss going out walking and climbing with him.'\n"]}

The items are crafts and artifacts made by Japanese-Americans confined to World War II internment camps. A grass-roots campaign of a change.org petition, a Facebook page, and mediation by \"Star Trek\" actor George Takei has resulted in Rago Arts and Auction Center agreeing to pull the items from the sale. \"There is an essential discussion to be had about the sale of historical items that are a legacy of man's inhumanity to man. It extends beyond what is legal. It is something auction houses, galleries and dealers are faced with regularly,\" the auction house said. \"We hope this controversy will be the beginning of a discourse on this issue.\" Takei, who with his family spent time in one of the camps, thanked people for working to stop the sale. According to a comment on the Facebook page \"Japanese American History: NOT for Sale,\" he was working on the issue while on a trip to Australia. \"It took a few calls today here in the wee hours, and I'll be issuing a formal statement later, but we can all celebrate a bit today at this news,\" he wrote. The auction house said 24 lots of an original collection of works of art and crafts were removed. During World War II, about 117,000 people of Japanese descent were forced to live in 10 internment camps. The government called them relocation centers. Many of the people who lived there and their descendants had another phrase for the facilities. They call them concentration camps. Two-thirds of the people who were ordered there were native born U.S. citizens, according to the National Archives. CNN affiliate KGO reported the items were given to historian Allen Eaton, who opposed internment camps. The items were inherited from the historian's estate. Miriam Tucker, a partner with the auction house, said it had hoped the items would go to someone who cared about their historical meaning. \"For us, there could be no better resolution than for a suitable museum, foundation or members of the Japanese-American community with the means to preserve this collection to come forward and secure it for education, display and research,\" she said. KGO reported the people it talked to would like items returned to family members if possible and any other artifacts put in an exhibition. \"This was a gift and let the gift come full circle,\" said Judy Hamaguchi with the San Francisco Chapter of the Japanese American Citizens League. She was referring to a letter the organization sent to the auction house. \"It should be returned as a gift.\" The lots have been packed away for now, said auction house partner David Rago in an email. \"Once the dust settles from this auction weekend (1,200 lots in three days) we will work with a small group of people from the Japanese-American community who have identified themselves through this process as generous, informed, voices of reason,\" he wrote. He said a suitable institution is the best possible home and the auction house will work with the current owner to find the right place. The seller -- known in the auction business as the consignor -- has never been in a position where the items could be donated, Rago said. \"But the consignor, who has been a sensitive and dedicated custodian of this collection for over 35 years, has agreed this evening to work with Rago Auctions to secure appropriate placement of Eaton's life work,\" he added.\n"]}

This year, Israel's Memorial Day commemoration is for bereaved family members such as Braham. \"Now I truly understand everyone who has lost a loved one,\" Braham said. Her husband, Philippe Braham, was one of 17 people killed in January's terror attacks in Paris. He was in a kosher supermarket when a gunman stormed in, killing four people, all of them Jewish. The terrorist, Amedy Coulibaly, recorded the attack on camera. Philippe Braham was laid to rest in Jerusalem's Givat Shaul cemetery after the attacks, not far from where the Jewish Agency held a memorial ceremony to mourn victims of terror. \"Today we all share the same pain,\" Valerie Braham said to the assembled crowd. \"I know they protect us from above.\" As Israel mourns on the nation's remembrance day, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced after his weekly Cabinet meeting that French authorities had foiled a terror plot. Valls said that France is fully mobilized following January's attack, which allowed authorities to identify and stop the planned attack. The latest news is a painful reminder of Braham's recent loss. Braham now lives for her young children. She has two daughters and one son. Braham tells them stories of their father to keep his memory alive and to keep herself strong. She pauses as she speaks, finding the right words to describe the love of her life who was taken from her. \"We had 10 years of marriage together, and we were a perfect couple. We had no problems. We didn't fight. It was like the day we were married,\" she said, holding back tears. She has told this story before, but it doesn't seem to get any easier. One month after the terror attacks in Paris, a gunman attacked a synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, killing Dan Uzan, who was working as a security guard for a bat mitzvah party. Uzan, 37, was laid to rest in Copenhagen. Like Valerie Braham, Uzan's parents attended the memorial service in Jerusalem. The recent attacks were on the nation's collective mind as mourners gathered in groups to commemorate fallen soldiers and victims of terror. The Copenhagen attack forced Braham to relive her fear. \"I have no idea,\" she said, hesitating. \"It seems they found a way to attack outside of war. It seems easy for them to attack, and it's frightening.\" When asked where she feels at home, Braham doesn't hesitate. It is her most confident answer. \"In Israel. Obviously, in Israel.

The sale of the retreat, in Trysil, north of Oslo, comes after it emerged last year that his family was planning to build a \u00a310million 'hospital' room for the star at their home in Switzerland.

Liquidating his assets: Michael Schumacher's family has sold his Norwegian mountain holiday home (pictured) for \u00a32million as he continues to recover from his horrific ski injuries . Schumacher, a very competent skier, was holidaying with family and friends in Meribel, France, where he owns a chalet when the accident happened in December 2013. He was skiing with then 14-year-old Mick on a red piste, which is classed for intermediate skiers. But shortly after 11am, he left the piste and skied on to an off-piste area located in between the red run and a blue run, for beginners to intermediates. It was here that he struck a partially-covered rock. He was not skiing fast but he lost control and catapulted 34 feet on to another rock. He smashed his head on the bolder. The force of the collision shattered his helmet. The footage recorded on a camera attached to his helmet was undamaged. Laughing: Gina Maria Schumacher's impressive performance at the horse shows comes after her 16-year-old brother Mick (left and right) returned to the racing circuit just weeks after being involved in a 100mph crash . Back in action: The protege was back on the circuit just weeks after a 100mph crash at the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany . The film, which included audio, captured the crash in full horror and was analysed by police who investigated the accident. Two months later, on February 17, the head of the inquiry, Prosecutor Patrick Quincy, closed the case. He announced that any criminal wrongdoing had been ruled out. He cleared the ski resort, stating that the piste had been marked correctly and that Schumacher 'deliberately' left the ski run. At the end of January it was announced that doctors had begun the process of gradually awakening him from his coma. Since September last year he has been looked after by medical experts at his home in Gland, Switzerland.\n"]}

Rules laid down by Transport for London (TfL) mean refugees and those applying for asylum do not have to reveal whether they have a criminal history when trying to become a cab driver. The legal loophole in an official application document on 'private hire driver licensing' says people coming to Britain will not be required to have their criminal convictions checked. Asylum seekers and refugees applying to be minicab drivers are exempt from criminal records checks . The form, seen by the Daily Express, states: 'With regards to overseas criminal records checks, no such checks will be made in respect of those applicants who declare that they are in possession of or who have applied for refugee or asylum status.' Everyone else who applies for a cab licence must undergo criminal records checks. Those from outside the EU who have spent more than three months abroad over the last three years have to provide a 'letter of good conduct' from their home country. This usually requires their country of origin to give a reference to the Home Office, revealing whether the applicant has a criminal history. But asylum seekers and refugees are exempt from this too, according to a second document. A TfL guide on taxi and private hire applications states: 'Any applicant who has been granted or is awaiting a decision to be granted asylum/refugee status will not be required to produce a Certificate of Good Conduct from the country he is claiming asylum from.' Applicants from outside the EU must provide a letter of 'good conduct' from their home country - but asylum seekers do not have to . Campaigners called for a change in the guidelines, calling on all minicab drivers to undergo thorough criminal checks. Tory MP Nick de Bois said: 'They should not be offering licences to those they can't check on. They could be putting vulnerable members of the public in the hands of thieves, murderers and rapists. It beggars belief.' Helen Chapman, manager of London taxi and private hire at TfL, said: 'All applicants for a Taxi or Private Hire drivers licence are required to undertake an enhanced Disclosure and Barring Service check which is carried out by the Home Office. 'Any applicant that has lived in a country other than the UK for more than three months within the last three years is also required to produce a Certificate of Good Conduct from the relevant country. 'We recognise this may not be possible if an applicant is granted asylum or refugee status and, where applicable, these applicants will be required to provide a Certificate of Good Conduct from any other country of residence within the last three years. They will also be required to provide evidence of their Certificate of Registration or a letter from the Border and Immigration Agency.'\n"]}

Cook plays a shot during a training session at the Grenada National Stadium in St Georges on Monday . In this scenario, because his front foot is still landing as the ball is halfway down, he is forced to play the shot with his hands away from his body, which is when you're most likely to nick the ball to the wicketkeeper or slips. He's clearly trying to open up his shoulders \u2014 perhaps he felt a bit closed off last summer \u2014 but he moved his front foot way too far against the West Indies and when you're out of nick and under pressure, your movements become exaggerated. It's important to note that in the second picture he has already started to move, making his footwork look worse than it is, but also that Cook has never been a brilliant front-foot player. He's at his best when he gets his movements out of the way early, giving him time to move to the pitch of the ball and bend his front knee into the drive. Of course, when you're in form you don't think about these things. But this is the hardest thing to do. Cook's greatest asset is his mental strength, and what he needs to do in matches is give himself 20 minutes to get settled. After a few boundaries it'll all come naturally. Saying that, I saw him in the nets on Sunday and he looked bloody good! So don't write him off yet.

Mr Davey was asked about changes to general classical music knowledge over the last 30 years. He said: 'If you look back at the Third Programme (the original name for Radio 3), they were bringing high culture to a relatively mass audience but they could assume that their audience knew everything. 'They did not need to have the ins and outs of classical music explained to them. 'The modern audience might not be getting the same education in music in school as they might have done a few years ago \u2013 not consistently so, anyway.

Mr Davey, who until January was chief executive of Arts Council England, added: 'I believe there are different ways to draw people into music. 'There's the Classic FM way, and they're very good at that. 'We'll be presenting more longer pieces and greater variety of composers, and we also provide the additional different kinds of music and the cultural commentary throughout.'

Brenda Finn, 30, says losing her hair at the age of 14 destroyed her confidence. She was also left suffering crippling anxiety and depression after bullying forced her to leave school. But now, after her family paid for her to have eyebrows tattooed on, she says she is finally able to face the world with more confidence. However she says having the procedure earlier would have made a huge difference to her life. Scroll down for video . Brenda Finn, 30, became depressed after her body hair and fingernails fell out (pictured left) due to alopecia. She says having eyebrows tattooed on (pictured right) has given her the confidence to face the world again . Miss Finn is calling for medical tattooing to become available on the NHS, as she says it could have saved her years of emotional pain. She suffered from crippling anxiety and depression due to her hair loss . Crucially, she feels it would save the NHS money to make the treatment available to alopecia sufferers, who may then not require expensive counseling or ongoing treatment for anxiety and depression. She said: \u2018Getting my eyebrows back has done for me overnight what psychotherapy and anti depressants could not. \u2018It has made me look more \"normal\" and feel more accepted because I don\u2019t look so different anymore. 'I had forgotten what a difference eyebrows can make to a face and only wish I had access to this treatment years earlier. It could have saved years of anguish. \u2018The incredible difference it has made to me is why I think eyebrows should be available on the NHS and I hope that I can help make a difference to other sufferers.\u2019 Miss Finn says she does not consider the treatment to be cosmetic, but reconstructive. She said: \u2018I was so young when I lost my eyebrows that I hadn\u2019t ever really drawn them on and if I did they were wonky and rubbish and made me look worse. \u2018I remained very self conscious about it.\u2019 The children\u2019s entertainer from London was 14 when she was diagnosed with alopecia universalis. She woke up one morning to find hair on her pillow and when she scratched her eyebrow it fell out. She explained: \u2018Mum thought I was playing a trick on her to get off school but when she realised I was telling the truth she panicked. After having her eyebrows tattooed on, Miss Finn even found the confidence to take part in a charity fashion show without her wig . Miss Finn was bullied at school for wearing a wig, shattering her confidence so much she left school. Working as a nursery assistant with children, who accepted her wig, built up her confidence again . \u2018I could tell she thought there was something seriously wrong and rushed me straight to the doctor.\u2019 After blood tests Miss Finn was told she had alopecia and within weeks had lost all of her hair and nails. It was then when she started wearing a wig to school that the bullying started. She explained: \u2018 I was nicknamed \"cancer girl,\" despite the fact I did not have cancer. 'My wig would be torn off my head to be used as a football or flushed down the toilet.\u2019 She endured six traumatic months before her teachers and parents agreed she should be home schooled. \u2018The bullying was so bad that I had just shut down mentally,' she said. 'I wasn\u2019t learning anything at school at all anymore because the bullying dominated everything.\u2019 She says she became very reclusive and rarely left the house for the next three years. \u2018Looking back I was likely suffering agoraphobia triggered by the alopecia - but it wasn\u2019t ever diagnosed.\u2019 It was only when her parents were able to purchase more expensive natural looking wigs that she started to feel confident enough to face the world again. Miss Finn had a \u00a3300 procedure to tattoo eyebrows on to her face (she is pictured before, left, and after, right). She said: \u2018It was like my face changed overnight. It had structure and definition again' After securing a work placement at a local nursery, her confidence slowly grew and she one day admitted to the children that she wore a wig. She said: \u2018Working with children was a great tonic for me because they are so accepting and didn\u2019t care a jot that I was bald. 'In fact they loved playing with my wigs. It did wonders for my confidence.\u2019 In time, she started work as a children\u2019s entertainer and enjoyed being able to \u2018hide\u2019 behind the costumes which concealed her hair and face. Then last year her mother-in-law to be then told her about eyebrow tattooing, but Miss Finn could not afford the \u00a3300 procedure. She hoped it would be available on the NHS but when she learned it wasn't, her future-mother-in law offered to treat her. She had the tattoo in February last year and was amazed at the difference it made. Miss Finn was 14 when she was diagnosed with alopecia universalis, meaning she has lost all her body hair, (she is pictured before suffering the condition) She said: \u2018It was like my face changed overnight. It had structure and definition again. I looked, dare I say it, a bit more normal again. \u2018I can\u2019t explain how good that felt. \u2018I\u2019m in a totally different place because of it and feel strongly that it should be available to all sufferers. \u2018I was very fortunate to have family pay for it but others won\u2019t be. And they may be costing the NHS more in therapy or pills to lift their mood. \u2018I seriously think it needs to be addressed.\u2019 Miss Finn, who is set to marry her fianc\u00e9 Wayne next year, even found the confidence to take part in a charity fashion show without her wig, something she would never have done before her tattooed eyebrows. She said: \u2018This isn\u2019t about vanity, it\u2019s about acceptance after a medical condition which is a crucial part of the healing process mentally and physically.\u2019 She has now launched a petition to get the treatment on the NHS.

Manuel Pellegrini could be worried about his position at Manchester City after losing against their fierce rivals .

Boxer Ricky Hatton, pictured at the Etihad for a press conference in 2008, says he wants 'the old City back' Noel Gallagher says there is 'apathy' towards the Champions League among the City supporters . 5 - Games lost by City in 2015, one more than the whole of 2014. 13 - City's position in the Premier League form table after losing four and winning two of their last six. 4 - The first time since losing 4-3 to United in 2009 that City have conceded four in the league. 9 - City have nine points fewer than they did at this stage last season. 70.8 - City's pass completion rate percentage at Old Trafford was their worst of the season. One of the weirdest things I've been hearing lately is people saying Manuel Pellegrini was the right man at the right time for Manchester City. Their logic is that his calm was needed after the Roberto Mancini reign ended with a fractured dressing room, and an FA Cup final defeat at the hands of Wigan Athletic. Pellegrini is calm but it was the worst kind of short-term thinking which has led to City now clinging on to fourth place. The dressing room calmed down temporarily, but he doesn't have the character or gravitas to galvanise a group of players when the going gets tough. He's punching above his weight at Manchester City. City need to stop pussy-footing around and drag the fans into the modern game. They need to fill up the half-empty glasses of the supporters at the Etihad. Pellegrini's appointment would have suited those fans who resist the charge towards potential greatness. He is not a great manager. Look at his record before he arrived in England. He's done well but there is no evidence of greatness, and no suggestion of greatness to come. Frank Lampard applauds the travelling fans at Old Trafford as he leaves the pitch with\u00a0goalkeeper Joe Hart . Louis van Gaal shakes hands with his opposite number Pellegrini after the final whistle at Old Trafford . Jose Mourinho? Ronald Koeman? Sean Dyche? Not even close... Louis van Gaal should be crowned manager of the year . Forget Eden Hazard and Michael Carrick... the best player in the Premier League this weekend was Leicester's Jamie Vardy . And so it has proved. The signings Manchester City have made have also smacked of small-time thinking. They don't go for the great players anymore, they're not in that market. Jesus Navas is the perfect example: he is quick and that's it. He missed a great chance at the start of the Manchester derby because his end product is so poor. He cost a relatively cheap \u00a315million, but at 29 years old (he was signed in 2013), you wonder what the logic was behind this purchase. He's not good enough to be a regular in the starting line-up at a club with ambitions of dominating the Champions League and Barclays Premier League. Why weren't City in the market for Cesc Fabregas? Or Diego Costa? How come they didn't sign Angel di Maria? Financial Fair Play is often used as the excuse \u2013 it's holding City back apparently. Look at United, look at Chelsea \u2013 be cleverer with the spreadsheets and FFP isn't a problem. Aguero and Jesus Navas prepare for a free-kick at Old Trafford as the latter struggles to inspire the side . Navas is not good enough to be a regular in the starting XI at a club with ambitions of dominating Europe . City opted against going in the market for players such as Cesc Fabregas (left) and Angel di Maria . City's failure to make any kind of serious progress in Europe reflects badly on English football, but the fault is with the club. They need to think bigger and drag themselves towards greatness. Make big signings, they will improve the team, and if they arrive, they will motivate the big players already at City. Yaya Toure strikes me as the kind of player who will raise his game significantly if he had Sami Khedira alongside him, rather than Fernando. The big message out of City this season has been how brilliant and shiny their new academy set-up is. And it is truly spectacular \u2013 a world-class facility. But they don't have the team to match it and they absolutely don't have the manager. If they choose to lose Pellegrini, then they need to think big next time and go for a manager showing true potential to be great \u2013 like Diego Simeone or Jurgen Klopp. Pellegrini has been accused of punching above his weight at Premier League champions City . Diego Simeone (left) or Jurgen Klopp could be potential replacements for the City manager . Carlo Ancelotti is another that fits the bill if he was to leave current club Real Madrid at the end of the season . Two managers at less fashionable clubs, trying to fight with the big boys in their domestic league and in Europe. Or go for greatness itself \u2013 Carlo Ancelotti fits the bill, and so does the man we all expected the hierarchy at City to deliver \u2013 Pep Guardiola. When Sheik Mansour arrived at Manchester City he declared that he wanted the club to be winning in Europe. They're still not doing that, and it's about time City went to the next level, for their own good, and for the good of English football. It's like they poked their head out of United's shadow for a few seconds and got burned by the sunshine. Think big City, or forever stay small.\n"]}

Now officers have launched a manhunt to find Munden  - who was detained under the Mental Health Act after sexually touching the three-year-old girl. A predatory convicted paedophile with an obsession with young girls has gone on the run after vanishing from a psychiatric unit. Stephen Munden, 54, (pictured with and without a beard)\u00a0was last seen leaving a hospital, near Hook, Hampshire . He is described as about 5ft 8ins tall, of a heavy build, and has dark hair. Officers said they believed that Munden, who suffers from learning difficulties, may have shaved off his beard before leaving the hospital in Winchfield and have released images of him with both facial hair and a clean shave. He was detained at the private facility under a hospital order following his sentence last August for sexual offences. Munden was convicted of sexually touching a child under the age of 13. A court heard he deliberately sat near a three-year-old girl and stroked her hand with his finger - in full view of the child's mother and grandmother. Munden, formerly of Marchwood, near Southampton, denied the offence, claiming it was accidental when he appeared at Southampton Crown Court. During the sentencing David Jenkins, prosecuting, told Judge Peter Henry that the defendant had admitted ten unrelated offences of possessing or attempting to possess indecent images of children. The court heard he had been arrested after using one of the public computers at Hythe library in an attempt to download images. Mr Jenkins said children's clothes, books and dolls were found at Munden's home and added: 'He has a fanatical obsession with young girls.'

Consultant physiatrist John O'Shea said the defendant was autistic and also suffered from mild learning difficulties.

Keely Harvey, in mitigation, said: 'He did not accept that he deliberately touched the child's hand.'

Laura Everley, 36, had experienced bloating, lower back pain and constipation over a three-month period. She also frequently needed to urinate. But having previously suffered irritable bowel syndrome and endometriosis, she put the symptoms down to those conditions. It was only when she stumbled across a post on her Facebook timeline, which detailed all the same symptoms, that she realised it could be cancer. Tests later revealed she had an aggressive ovarian tumour - and the disease had begun to spread. Scroll down for video . Laura Everley, 36, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer after seeing a post on Facebook describing all her symptoms. She had been suffering from\u00a0bloating, back pain, constipation and frequently needing the loo . In October 2014, Mrs Everley underwent a hysterectomy to remove her womb and her ovaries. She is pictured with husband Mark, and her five-year-old son, Harry, before being diagnosed with cancer . After performing a hysterectomy to remove her womb as well as her ovaries, surgeons revealed the cancer had already begun to spread. Mrs Everley is now undergoing chemotherapy and doctors are confident she can beat the disease. She hopes her story will raise awareness to the symptoms of ovarian cancer, prompting other women to see their doctor if they are worried. Warning signs of the disease can be difficult to recognise, particularly in the early stages. This is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). Mrs Everley said: 'The symptoms are the same, so I thought it could have been irritable bowel syndrome . 'I went down the gluten free route but that didn't make any difference. 'The idea of cancer hadn't even entered my head. You just never dream this going to happen to you.' By early 2014, she had been suffering with her symptoms for three months. The symptoms of ovarian cancer can be difficult to recognise, particularly in its early stages. This is because they are often the same as symptoms of other less serious conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS). However, three main symptoms are more frequent in women diagnosed with ovarian cancer. They are: . Other symptoms, such as back pain, needing to pass urine more frequently than usual, and pain during sex may be the result of other conditions in the pelvic area. However, they may be present in some women with ovarian cancer. Source: NHS Choices . Idly scrolling Facebook one evening, she noticed a post raising awareness of ovarian cancer. 'A friend had shared a post from a friend of theirs about her experiences of cancer and what she'd been through,' said Mrs Everley. 'There was a list of symptoms and I realised I had them all. 'I called my doctor straight away and told her that I thought I might have cancer.' Medics confirmed Mrs Everley had a cyst, which was removed and sent away for a biopsy. She was also referred for an internal examination, which revealed abnormalities. In October 2014, she was called into East Surrey hospital. 'I thought I was just going in for check-up so I didn't think to take anyone with me,' she said. 'I was told I had clear cell carcinoma. 'It all sounded very medical and I had no idea what that meant. Finally, it dawned on me that it was a type of ovarian cancer. 'I was on my own finding this out. It was awful. I spent ages with the Macmillan nurse afterwards, sobbing in shock. 'I phoned my husband Mark as soon as I came out of hospital and told him over the phone. I couldn't keep it to myself, I had to tell somebody. 'Having to tell my son Harry was horrible. He knows I have ovarian cancer, but he's only five so he doesn't quite understand what cancer means.' Two weeks later, Mrs Everley met with surgeons, who gave her a heartbreaking choice \u2013 whether to have one ovary removed, or a complete hysterectomy, which would leave her unable to have more children. 'I already had Harry, but I would have liked to have had more children,' she said. 'It was difficult but I decided on the full hysterectomy \u2013 I didn't want my cancer coming back. 'Afterwards doctors told me I'd made the right choice. I had stage 1c cancer, meaning the cancer cells weren't contained in my ovary. After the hysterectomy, Mrs Everley underwent a course of chemotherapy, with each round leaving her sick for a week afterwards. She also lost her hair - which she says was an emotional experience . 'I'd have needed the hysterectomy eventually anyway.' Now, Mrs Everley is nearing the end of her course of chemotherapy and doctors are confident she can be cured. Her treatment has been gruelling, however, with each round leaving her feeling constantly sick for a week afterwards. She has also lost her hair. 'My hair started coming out in clumps, so I decided to just get a friend to shave it,' she said. 'I didn't want to just watch it fall out. It was nice to regain a little control. 'It was a really emotional experience. My mum and dad came round and everybody cried \u2013 even my friend that was shaving my head. Mrs Everley has been promoting Target Ovarian Cancer charity, hosting a coffee morning to raise money . 'My mum held my hand throughout. It was tough but I felt better afterwards.' Mrs Everley has also been busy promoting Target Ovarian Cancer, hosting a coffee morning to raise money for the charity. She is also keen for women to be more aware of the symptoms of ovarian cancer. 'I don't think people are sure of symptoms. There's not a definite list, they're all a bit vague and lots of them could mean other things,' she said. 'I think that uncertainty puts people off going to the doctors. 'There's no screening for ovarian cancer like there is with the smear test for cervical. 'Women need to know the signs because early diagnosis is the best chance of survival. 'It's easy to dismiss and ignore symptoms, but it's not worth the risk.' Clear cell carcinoma is normally treated with a hysterectomy operation . Clear cell cancer of the ovary is an uncommon type of ovarian cancer. Epithelial ovarian cancer means the cancer started in the surface layer covering the ovary. It accounts for 3 to 5 per cent of patients with ovarian cancer in the western world and 20 per cent in the Far East. It is likely that the cause of clear cell cancer is different from the common variety. The prognosis for women with clear cell cancer is greatly influenced by the stage of the disease. Clear cell cancer may also arise more commonly in women with a history of endometriosis. The first treatment is the same as for the common form of epithelial ovarian cancer \u2013 a hysterectomy. In some circumstances removal of the lymph glands in the pelvis and back of the abdomen may also be included. As well as removing the pelvic organs (ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus and omentum \u2013 the fatty tissue that covers the abdominal organs), fluid will be collected from the abdominal cavity for testing for any cancer cells. A pathologist will examine the tissue and fluid removed to try and decide how advanced the cancer is. Some tumours are just in the ovary and so will have a better prognosis, about 20 per cent are stage 1. However, in some cases, tumours will have spread through the outer lining (capsule) of the ovary and to other organs including the uterus (womb), fallopian tubes, the lymph glands and the omentum. Usually post-operative treatment involves chemotherapy. Source: Ovacome .\n"]}

{"question_id": 321, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Amid the horror of a Nazi concentration camp, liberated by the British Army 70 years ago this week, love blossomed against all the odds between an emaciated inmate and one of the soldiers sent to arrest her SS guards. But the love between British soldier, Sergeant Norman Turgel, 24 at the time, and teenage Polish girl Gena, 20, was only kindled because of the generosity and kindness of the camp's British commander\u00a0Major Leonard Berney. This week survivors and liberators of the notorious Bergen-Belsen camp in northern Germany gathered to commemorate the day British soldiers entered its gates and began the task of saving as many of the 60,000 starving inmates as was possible. Gena and Norman were married two months short of their golden wedding anniversary of 50 years, pictured before his passing in 1995 . Norman Turgel pictured as a young soldier in the British Intelligence Corps in his early 20s (l) and\u00a0Gena Turgel as a young girl (r) Gena, weighing only a few pounds was, like many others in the camp, a walking skeleton, for whom certain death was only days away. Among the recently dead was Dutch girl Anne Frank whose diaries while hiding from the Nazis in Amsterdam became world renowned. But through the striped and filthy prison uniform, Sergeant Norman Turgel of the 53 Field Security section of British Intelligence Corps, spotted an eternal beauty and began talking to her. Before long Norman had fallen in love with the young Jewish girl who at last was being fed proper food and was being given clothes to wear again. Anne Frank, whose diaries of persecution at the hands of the Nazis became the defining account of the Holocaust, was just one of Bergen-Belsen's many victims. Frank was living in the Netherlands when the Nazis seized it in 1940, leaving them trapped. In 1942 they were forced into hiding in secret rooms hidden inside Otto Frank's office building. They spent two years there, but were anonymously betrayed and sent to the concentration camps. Anne, and her sister Margot, were taken to Bergen-Belsen, where they died of typhus in February 1945, just months before the Allies liberated it. Bergen-Belsen's SS commandant, the cruel and tyrannical Joseph Kramer, was among those Norman helped to round up and capture. Other soldiers helped hand out fresh bread and fruit. Norman became so besotted with Gena that he told her he was going to marry her one day. But here the story could have ended had it not been for Major Leonard Berney, the new commanding officer of what became Belsen Camp for Displaced Persons. With Norman posted away and other prisoners being repatriated to all parts of Europe, there was a danger of the young lovers being parted forever. Major Leonard Berney, who is now 95, was the commanding officer of liberated Belsen. He played cupid for soldier Norman  and Gena. Pictured in uniform (l) and more recently (r) Bergen Belsen was located in northern Germany, south-west of the town of Bergen itself. From 1941 ro 1945 almost 50,000 people were killed there along with 20,000 Soviet inmates . The Camp was liberated on 15 April 1945 by the British 11th Armoured Division and soldiers discovered roughly 60,000 starved, and ill prisoners inside. 13,000 unburied corpses littered the ground around the camp when they arrived . When the Allies arrived at Bergen-Belsen, it was in the grip of a terrible typhus outbreak, with prisoners dying at a rate of 500 a day. A sombre sign erected by the British Army, and photographed by Mr Parsons, documents at least part of that grisly death tool, revealing that 13,000 people perished even after troops came to their aid. Shortly after the camp was liberated by British and Canadian troops in 1945, it was torched, and at least part of that suffering was destroyed forever as the buildings, along with the Reichskriegs flag and Hitler portrait which adorned them, were consumed by flames. Major Berney, now 95 and living in retirement, took a personal interest in their unlikely romance, making sure messages to each other reached their destination in the chaos of the post-liberation activity. Major Berney wrote about his experiences in 'Liberating Belsen Concentration Camp' and gave evidence at the Belsen war crimes trials. His son, John Wood said: 'My father gave the young couple permission to hold an engagement party and they were grateful for ever for his personal interventions. Without him, they might well have lost touch.' Historic: As a crowd of people watch on, British troops burn the buildings to the ground . Horrific: Around 500 people were dying per day of typhus and starvation when the Allies arrived . The camp, which became the final resting place of 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and those with disabilities, is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 . Once Gena had been released from her living hell and been restored to health,\u00a0Norman and she married and started lived in London. They went on to have three children, Hilary 68, Bernice, 63, and Harris 62, eight grandchildren and 12 great grand children. Norman died in 1995, two months short of their golden wedding anniversary. He passed away a few years ago but Gena was prominent this week in the anniversary of Belsen's liberation. Gena at a book launch with Major Berney's son, John Wood, who said: 'My father gave the young couple permission to hold an engagement party and they were grateful for ever for his personal interventions' She said: 'Today it is hard to imagine what it was like in the camp, people so thin and so defeated that it was hard to tell if they were men or women. 'I spent many days with Anne Frank. She was a beautiful, sweet girl but she got ill and I was with her to almost the last. She gazed into the distance as the days went by and I could tell she had gone. 'I was lucky and for that I can thank Major Berney. He was a wonderful man and made sure that Norman and I kept our romance alive in the most testing conditions.

Authorities named Abu Khaled al-Cambodi - former Melbourne man Neil Prakash - as a key figure in their investigation into a plot where teenagers were allegedly planning to attack police on Saturday. Now al-Cambodi has starred in a 12-minute long propaganda video where, cradling a gun, he has ordered his 'beloved brothers' to 'rise up' and attack targets in Australia. 'You must start attacking before they attack you,' the 23-year-old said. 'Look how much your sisters have been violated. Threatening message: Abu Khaled al-Cambodi, an Australian IS militant, has starred in a vile new propaganda video . Despite the militant's vitriol, the most recent local headlines surrounding anti-Muslim prejudice have focused upon Sydney woman Stacey Eden, 23, standing up for a couple being bullied on the train . 'All I hear about the news in Australia is this sister was hurt, this sister's hijab was ripped off... I ask you brothers, when are you going rise up and attack them'. Despite the militant's vitriol, the most recent local headlines surrounding anti-Muslim prejudice have focused  upon Sydney woman Stacey Eden, 23, standing up for a couple being bullied on the train. al-Cambodi is thought to have become the most senior recruiter of Australian militants for the Islamic State. Terror expert Professor Greg Barton has described him as 'Baryalei Mark II' - a reference to former Sydney militant Mohammad Ali Baryalei. Baryalei, a former spruiker in the city's nightclub district and a bit-part actor in the crime drama Underbelly, was killed last October. The militant was seen with a gun slung over his shoulder and clambering through rubble . Raid scenes: A man walks past a broken window from a police raid in Melbourne designed to foil the purported Anzac Day plot . 'It seems that Prakash has stepped in as the Baryalei Mark II, and that's significant,' Prof Barton, director at Monash University's Global Terrorism Research Centre, told the ABC's 730\u00a0program. 'That makes him, like Baryalei before him, the highest ranking Australian within Islamic State we're aware of.' Baryalei was the ringleader of a foiled plot to behead a random member of the public in Sydney. Mohammad Ali Baryalei was a senior Islamic commander - and a bit part actor in Unberbelly (above, his acting shot) - before he was killed . In the propaganda video, al-Cambodi discusses becoming a Muslim not long after hearing a unnamed preacher lecture about 'Judgment Day'. At various points, he is filmed greeting other men in shops and on the streets of the Islamic State. At one point, he even shoots a broad smile at the camera. The video featuring al-Cambodi was advertised at the conclusion of a similar video last July, but it did not appear online until this week.\n"]}

The Clarets are gearing up for the final eight games of their Barclays Premier League survival battle reinvigorated after a warm-weather training camp. Sean Dyche's squad - minus the four players on international duty - spent last week in Spain preparing for a run-in that begins with Sunday's tricky visit of Tottenham. Sean Dyche believes his Burnley side are more than capable of avoiding the Premier League drop . They have a tough battle ahead but recent performances - not least last month's defeat of champions Manchester City - have given hope that a side rated as pre-season relegation favourites can escape the bottom three. The idea of a late-season getaway worked wonders last year, as Dyche's men returned to secure a promotion spot and he hopes for a similar boost this time. The 43-year-old said: 'Last year we found it gave the lads a change and a change is almost as good a rest. We came back and we did the business by getting ourselves promoted. Star man Danny Ings will need to be in top form to get the better of the Tottenham Hotspur defence . 'It's a different kind of challenge this time but we want the same outcome which is to win games and be in the Premier League. 'Wins have been hard to come by - or certainly harder to come by - and it's a big jump in quality but I think slowly but surely we're refocusing on what the job is, learning as we go and delivering good performances. 'I have total belief we will be in the Premier League.' George Boyd (21) celebrates after scoring the winner against Manchester City at Turf Moor . Burnley were written off by many after failing to win any of their opening 10 games but have since proved they are no pushovers. They remain in the relegation zone but were still just three points off 15th place ahead of the weekend fixtures. The Spurs clash is followed by another tough task against Arsenal but Dyche has no doubt his side will push hard. He said: 'I don't know what they're thinking (about us) but I think they know we'll give everything to win a game. That's well documented. They know about the energy and physical desire of the team and behind that there is quality there. Harry Kane has been the player of Tottenham's season and will need to be watched carefully on Sunday . 'Of course that's got to win games. We beat Man City but we need more of that, and it's not always good play but a bit of luck, a decision to go your way every now and then. 'I think our performances have been decent at least. We know they're tough games and the next one will be Tottenham but we'll be ready.' Dyche has dismissed suggestions that his side, inexperienced at the top level, could start flagging as the heat intensifies in the coming weeks. Michael Duff (left) challenges Arsenal star Alexis Sanchez during their clash at the Emirates Stadium . He said: 'Last season there was no sign of that and this season there is no sign of that. 'We will be playing hard in every game to get the points we need to be in the Premier League. It feels like there is no slowing down in what I believe, no slowing down in the training schedules.

Maysak is moving west-northwest after skirting the Federated States of Micronesia, according to the U.S. Joint Typhoon Warning Center. Its eye is projected to make landfall in the central or northern part of the Philippine island of Luzon on Sunday, though the country's residents could start feeling its effects days before. That could interrupt the Easter celebration for many in the predominantly Catholic nation, which may be socked by heavy rains and potent winds. The International Red Cross noted that \"many people are expected to throng coastal areas at this time.\" Images of the typhoon as seen from the International Space Station were posted to Twitter, including a Vine video showing the swirling eye of the storm. The storm has weakened and is expected to lose more strength before it reaches the Philippines. Its maximum sustained winds on Wednesday were 150 mph, making it a super typhoon in the Joint Typhoon Warning Center's definition. But by Thursday, the winds' strength had declined to around 132 mph -- no longer a super typhoon but still the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane. Meteorologist Ivan Cabrera told CNN that Maysak could weaken further to become a tropical storm by the time it reaches the Philippine coast. \"This will not be a catastrophic storm,\" Cabrera said. That said, it could still cause flooding and bring strong winds, he cautioned. The Philippines is frequently hit by typhoons. In December, for instance, Hagupit killed at least 18 people in the East Asian nation and injured hundreds more. But that devastation paled in comparison to the havoc wrought by Super Typhoon Haiyan in November 2013, which killed more than 6,000 people and injured more than 27,000 others. That typhoon, considered to be among the strongest storms ever to make landfall, hit the eastern city of Tacloban especially hard. The irony of the upcoming storm is its timing: in April, just after the Philippines Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration officially declared the onset of the nation's dry, or summer, season. PAGASA meteorologist Shelley Ignacio predicts Maysak -- which is called Chedeng in the Philippines -- will bring heavy rains to Luzon starting on Friday, according to the state-run Philippines News Agency. The country's National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council went on red alert on Wednesday because of the storm, the news agency reports. That alert means all relevant personnel are on standby and the public should be on guard for possible effects of the storm. CNN's Jethro Mullen contributed to this report.\n"]}

Carlos Colina, 32, is being held on $1 million bail after pleading not guilty to aggravated assault and battery and improper disposal of a human body in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday. The remains of Jonathan Camilien, 26, including a torso and limbs, were found in a duffel bag near the campus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Saturday morning before his head was found in Colina's apartment building across the street, according to the police report. Now the Boston Herald has unearthed police reports and witness accounts showing Colina had intimidated fellow gym users and even fought them before being thrown out. Accused: Carlos Colina is pictured at his arraignment in Cambridge, Massachusetts on Monday after human body parts were discovered in a duffel bag and a head was found in his building's recycling bin . Colina previously worked out at the Cambridge Athletic Club but was kicked out following a fight over gym equipment on November 24. A witness told the Herald how Colina started punching a much smaller man all over his body as the man unsuccessfully tried to fight back. He suffered bloody cuts to his head, the witness said. 'The trainers broke the fight up,' he said. 'Carlos gets up and starts walking away, yelling, \"I'm a beast! I'm a beast!\u2019 like he was proud of himself.'

'Threats': A witness said Colina had also intimidated other gym users when he wanted to use equipment . Colina is believed to have known his alleged victim; he is friends with his younger brother, Christopher Camilien, on Facebook. The two brothers lived together in Somerville. Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan said Camilien's death is considered a\u00a0homicide,\u00a0even though Colina has not been charged with murder.\u00a0She said analysis of evidence and more information from the medical examiner are needed to determine if additional charges are warranted. 'We are not seeking anyone else in connection with the discovery of these human remains,' she said. No motive has been released. Colina and Camilien\u00a0were last seen returning to the building just after 11pm on Friday, according to the investigation, and a neighbor reported hearing an argument coming from the apartment. Colina was seen in surveillance video from nearby Biogen offices exiting the apartment building at about 4.15am on Saturday carrying a duffel bag, authorities said. Scene: A vacuum could be heard inside his building, pictured, after police discovered the victim's head .

The four spent the weekend in jail and will appear again before Dartmouth Provincial Court today to determine whether they will receive bail. Crown attorney Scott Morrison said: 'It is a sensitive issue and a very serious charge. 'At this point it's possible they could be released, but the main issue is whether or not they will be allowed to leave Canada.' A Ministry of Defence spokesman said the navy 'takes allegations of this nature very seriously, however as legal proceedings continue it would be inappropriate to comment further'.

DailyMail.com last weekend exposed Brady Eaves, the privately-educated stepson of a former Mississippi governor candidate, as the teenager who shrieked with laughter as he murdered the small animal in a video from a drunken Spring Break party. The footage, allegedly filmed in Florida, could see Eaves charged with felony animal cruelty charges, which carry a maximum jail term of five years and $5,000 in fines. In a statement branding his actions 'disturbing' and 'disappointing', Eaves' stepfather and mother revealed he has been withdrawn from the University of Mississippi, where he was on a scholarship, and submitted for mental health tests. It comes after Phi Delta Theta openly condemned Eaves' actions and expelled him from the fraternity.

Elite family: His stepfather is John Arthur Eaves Jr, pictured with his mother Angel Eaves, during the 2007 campaign for governor of Mississippi. Eaves Jr, the Democratic candidate, lost and is now a pro-life lawyer . His stepfather John Arthur Eaves Jr, who was the Democratic candidate in Mississippi's 2007 gubernatorial elections, and mother Angel Eaves told the press: 'Let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet. 'The actions that appear in the video go against everything that our son has been taught, and we can assure everyone that his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character.'

We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again.' Sources close to Eaves told DailyMail.com he was top of his class at private Jackson Preparatory School, and described him as an 'animal lover' whose numerous pets include a raccoon and a parrot. However, last weekend the teenager from Madison, MS, swept the internet in a video that showed him pull a hamster from a cage, bite off its head, and hurl its body into the distance.

According to sources connected to the incident, the party of college students force-fed the hamster vodka and 'hot-boxed' its cage with marijuana before the sickening stunt. His stepfather John Arthur Eaves Jr, a born-again Christian who was slammed for blaming unemployment on the state's Hispanic population during his 2007 election campaign, did not respond to DailyMail.com's request for a comment last week before releasing a statement a day later. Now CEO of Eaves Law Firm in Jackson, Mississippi, Eaves Jr has unsuccessfully run for state governor and U.S. Congress. He lost to the Republican incumbent Haley Barbour, winning 42 per cent of the vote, following controversial claims about the state's growing Latino population. His clients today include victims of the Costa Concordia cruise boat crash. He has three sons from his first marriage, and a young daughter with Brady's mother, advertising executive Angel Eaves, in leafy Madison, MS. In the video, his stepson Brady is surrounded by friends in beachwear who shriek with laughter as he pulls the animal from a blue cage. The footage starts with the voice of one party-goer balking: 'Oh my f***ing God! No way!' Screaming: Eaves bellows a yell and smiles into the camera as party-goers look on open-mouthed . Others can be heard jeering: 'So good! So good!' Hurling the hamster over a fence, Eaves bellows a yell as others are seen grinning and laughing behind him. The video was uploaded to YouTube on Friday night under the name\u00a0'psycho drunk spring breaker bites head off of hamster'. Within minutes, it was removed from the video-sharing site for violating its codes of conduct. Caching the video, animal rights group PETA launched a manhunt to track Eaves down. Stephanie Bell, PETA's Cruelty Casework Director, told DailyMail.com they plan to press charges. 'It is horrific,' Bell said. 'Animal abuse is a community concern. People who abuse animals rarely do so only once and almost never stop there. 'The link between cruelty to animals and inter-personal violence is undeniable. Many of our nation's serial killers and most school shooters share a history of animal abuse. 'Often, humans and animals are abused at the same time. For example, the guy who kicks the family dog is likely abusing his spouse and children too. Cruelty to animals is always a red flag.' First, as the parents of Brady Eaves, let everyone please be assured that we do not take the subject of animal cruelty lightly, nor do we in any way condone the behavior displayed in the recent video of our son that has gone viral on the internet. The actions that appear in the video go against everything that our son has been taught, and we can assure everyone that his actions are not what he believes in his heart, nor are true to his character. While we are extremely disappointed and greatly disturbed by his actions, as his parents, we know Brady to be a very bright and talented young man with a huge heart. As parents we are obviously and very seriously concerned about the well-being of our son. We have withdrawn him from school, and fully intend on professionally assessing why he behaved in such a horrible way, and what we must do as a family to keep this type of behavior from ever happening again. Raising teenagers in today\u2019s world, as most caring and loving parents realize, can challenge the best of us. We will continue to love our son with all of our hearts and be right there by his side as our family addresses this situation. We would sincerely appreciate that all parents who have gone through similar incidents with their children, and the entire community please keep us in their thoughts and prayers. Thank you, .

Glenna Kohl of Barnstable spent years in the sun as a Cape Cod lifeguard and countless hours laying in indoor tanning beds while at college. She was diagnosed with melanoma just after graduating from a Rhode Island college in 2005. Three years later, at just 26 years old, Glenna would be dead after a painful cancer battle. Now, her parents want the world to know the very real dangers posed by tanning even to the very young. Sad: Glenna Kohl of Barnstable spent years in the sun as a Cape Cod lifeguard and countless hours laying in indoor tanning beds while at college. She was diagnosed with melanoma just after graduating from a Rhode Island college in 2005 . Started in high school: Glenna was an avid tanner starting in high school and would sit in the sun some 40 hours per week every summer while working as a life guard in Cape Cod. In college, she tanned frequently in sun beds . Glenna was diagnosed with stage III melanoma after she found a golf ball sized lump in her groin just before graduating from college in 2005 . 'No one in our family knew what melanoma was,' Glenna's mother, Colleen Kohl, recalled to Cosmopolitan (via ELLE)\u00a0'We did a lot of crying.' The dreaded diagnosis came after Glenna, at just 22, discovered a golf ball-sized lump in her groin while working out at the gym one day. She would eventually see a doctor and get a biopsy. Physicians would trace the cancer back to a mole Glenna had removed years earlier, but which doctors had failed to identify as melanoma. By then, she already had stage III melanoma. But Glenna was prepared to fight. 'Whatever I have to do to fight cancer, I'll do,' her father Bob recalls his daughter saying. Because the cancer had spread to her lymphatic system, doctors removed 13 lymph nodes from her groin. Less than a year later, Glenna found a small lump in her abdomen and was told her cancer had progress to stage IV. Glenna was given more powerful drugs, but the cancer continued to spread. She tried experimental treatments with terrible side effects, but they were no use. Glenna died in November 2008, three years after her diagnosis--and her final tanning session. 'As health-conscious as Glenna was, she didn't connect tanning with skin cancer,' said Glenna's mother, who's now working to make sure others will make that connection before it's too late. 'Glenna's not here to inform people of the dangers,' Colleen told Cosmo. 'so we're going to continue her work for her.' Since their daughter's death, Colleen and Bob have launched the Glenna Kohl Fund for Hope in order to 'increase awareness of the Cape Cod community to the importance of early detection and prevention of melanoma and to support those fighting this deadly disease.' h/t YouTube/Maryellen Maguire-Eisen .

Glenna died in November 2008, three years after her diagnosis--and her final tanning session. Thanks in part to the group's efforts, the state of Massachusetts in 2014 passed a bill banning indoor tanning for those under 16 and requiring express consent from parents for those aged 16 or 17. Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer with 9,000 people dying each year from the mostly preventable disease. The Melanoma Research Foundation says exposure to tanning beds before age 30 increases a person\u2019s risk of developing melanoma by 75 percent. Doctors recommend doing regular skin checks for new moles and seeing a doctor if any change in size, shape or color. Doctors also recommend applying at least 1 ounce of sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or more to exposed skin and reapplying every two hours, more if swimming or sweating. Children in particular should be protected because bad sunburns in childhood are thought to greatly increase risk later in life.

Secretary of State John Kerry said Washington would not accept foreign interference in the country in a direct criticism of Tehran's backing of Shiite Houthi fighters. It comes as a Saudi-led coalition continues to pound anti-government forces in Yemen at the start of a third week of bombing. Scroll down for video . US Secretary of State John Kerry has warned that the US will not 'stand by' while Iran supports rebels in Yemen . A member of the Saudi border guard is stationed at a look-out point on the Saudi-Yemeni border today. A Saudi-led coalition is continuing to pound anti-government forces in Yemen . Mr Kerry told PBS television: 'There have been - there are, obviously - flights coming from Iran. Every single week there are flights from Iran and we've traced it and know this. 'Iran needs to recognise that the United States is not going to stand by while the region is destabilised or while people engage in overt warfare across lines, international boundaries in other countries.' The United States has backed the Saudi-led campaign, which launched air strikes last month as the rebels advanced on Yemen's main southern city of Aden after seizing the capital Sanaa. President Abedrabbo Mansour Hadi fled Aden for Saudi Arabia during the Houthi advance and the city has since seen heavy clashes between pro and anti-government forces. Riyadh has accused Tehran, the major Shiite power, of backing the rebels in a bid to establish a pro-Iran state on its doorstep. But Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif insisted his government wanted a swift end to the fighting, which has cost more than 640 lives since March 19, according to the World Health Organization. Military force: Saudi army tanks are seen deployed near the Saudi-Yemeni border, in southwestern Saudi Arabia . Patrol: Saudi guards drive tanks and armed vehicles along the border with Yemen . Mr Kerry, fresh from world powers striking a framework agreement with Iran on its nuclear programme, said Washington was not looking for confrontation with Tehran. 'But we're not going to step away from our alliances and our friendships and the need to stand with those who feel threatened as a consequence of the choices that Iran might be making.' In another sign of growing US support for the Saudi effort, the Pentagon said it had started daily aerial refuelling for warplanes in the coalition. The first refuelling flight took place on Tuesday night with a US Air Force KC-135 Stratotanker providing fuel for a F-15 fighter jet operated by Saudi Arabia and an F-16 flown by the United Arab Emirates, spokesman Colonel Steven Warren said. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned that last week's  framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal. And President Hassan Rouhani said separately that the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day'. 'What has been done so far does not guarantee an agreement, nor its contents, nor even that the negotiations will continue to the end,' said Khamenei, who has the final word on all matters of state. After a week of gruelling last-ditch negotiations, Tehran and the six powers agreed on April 2 on the framework of a deal to be finalised by the end of June reining in Iran's nuclear programme in return for the lifting of international sanctions. 'Everything is in the detail, it may be that the other side, which is unfair, wants to limit our country in the details,' Khamenei said, in his first comments on the deal. Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei\u00a0has warned that last week's framework accord with world powers was no guarantee of a final nuclear deal . Playing down expectations of a deal after the interim accord - which sparked celebrations in the streets of Iranian cities - Khamenei said he had not taken any position until now as 'there is nothing to take a stance on'. 'Officials say that nothing has been done yet and there is nothing binding. I am neither for nor against.' Under the outline text agreed in the Swiss city of Lausanne between Tehran and the so-called P5+1 powers - the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany - Iran must significantly reduce its number of centrifuges in exchange for a suspension of sanctions. The outline was a major breakthrough in a 12-year international crisis over Iran's nuclear programme. 'I have always supported and still support the Iranian negotiating team,' Khamenei said. 'I welcome any agreement that protects the interests and greatness of the nation, but having no agreement is more honourable than an agreement in which the interests and greatness of the nation is damaged.' Iranian President Hassan Rouhani\u00a0said the Islamic republic would not sign any final agreement unless 'all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day' He said that retaining a civil nuclear industry in any agreement was vital for Iran's future development. 'The nuclear industry is a necessity, for energy production, for desalination, and in the fields of medicine, agriculture and other sectors,' he said. In a potential obstacle to any final deal, Rouhani said his country wanted sanctions lifted on the day of the implementation of any agreement. 'We will not sign any agreements unless on the first day of the implementation of the deal all economic sanctions are totally lifted on the same day,' he said. The pace at which the sanctions will be lifted is one of the outstanding issues that still has to be agreed in the final accord. Western governments, which have imposed their own sanctions over and above those adopted by the United Nations, have been pushing for it to happen only gradually. 'In return for Iran's future cooperation, we and our international partners will provide relief in phases from the sanctions that have impacted Iran's economy,' US Secretary of State John Kerry said last week. Rouhani, who was speaking on Iran's National Nuclear Technology Day, reiterated that his government remained determined to develop its civil nuclear programme. 'We will have a tanker sortie every day,' Warren said, adding that all flights will be outside of Yemeni air space. The air strikes killed at least 14 rebel fighters in Aden overnight Thursday at positions near the northern edge of the city, a source in pro-government forces told AFP. Air strikes also hit a military camp in the southern Shabwa province that was seized by the Houthis' main allies - security forces who have remained loyal to former strongman Ali Abdullah Saleh, a local official said. The official had no information on casualties among the forces loyal to Saleh, who has been accused of joining with the Houthis after being ousted from power in 2012 after an Arab Spring-inspired uprising. Yemen has been wracked by conflict since Saleh's ouster, with Hadi unable to assert government authority in a deeply tribal country riven by divisions.

Conflict: Yemeni supporters of the southern seperatist movement fire towards Houthi rebels during clashes in the southern city of Aden yesterday . As well as the Houthis, who hail from Yemen's north, the government has struggled against Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), considered the most dangerous of the jihadist network's branches. Authorities in Yemen had for years allowed Washington to carry out a drone war against AQAP but US forces pulled out of the country amid the latest unrest. Al-Qaeda has taken advantage of the chaos to seize control of some areas and carried out a series of deadly attacks on both government forces and the Houthis. As the fighting and air campaign drag on, concern has been growing for what aid workers say is a mounting humanitarian crisis. Some aid trickled in to Aden by ship on Wednesday but efforts by the International Committee of the Red Cross to organise flights of cargo planes into Sanaa have so far failed.

Zarif laid out a four-stage plan for talks, calling for an immediate ceasefire followed by humanitarian assistance, dialogue among Yemenis and the formation of an 'all-inclusive government'. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was also quoted on Thursday as calling for a regional effort to end the fighting. 'The groups in Yemen should meet and work on possible solution.

Don\u2019t be caught out by this impressive run of form and think everything is in place for a crack at the title next year. It is not uncommon to see Arsenal finish a season with a string of good results. Usually they rattle out a sequence of wins just in time to preserve their place in the top four but too late to affect the destiny of the Barclays Premier League. The same thing has happened this year. Chelsea were relentless from the first whistle and have had the title race firmly under control since before Christmas. Arsenal players celebrate after their extra-time winner against Reading in the FA Cup semi-finals last week . Alexis Sanchez jumps in the air and celebrates wildly after his second goal for Arsenal at Wembley . With a 10-point advantage, even if Jose Mourinho loses to Arsene Wenger for the first time on Sunday it won\u2019t stop his side becoming champions. Next year, though, Chelsea won\u2019t have it all their own way and no team is better placed than Arsenal to dislodge them. There is a different feel to their form and performances this time around and Wenger said recently he could \u2018smell\u2019 something happening. You just hope, however, Wenger and Arsenal\u2019s board don\u2019t get fooled into thinking they have got all the tools they need at their disposal. This is not the time to be complacent. This is the summer when Arsenal must go for it and make the big additions that will stop them being nearly-men. That is exactly what Chelsea did 12 months ago. After finishing behind Manchester City and Liverpool, Mourinho didn\u2019t mess around. In came Diego Costa, who had spearheaded Atletico Madrid\u2019s La Liga success, and a World Cup winner in Cesc Fabregas. They meant business. The money was big but the quality was proven and, after they were unveiled, everyone began tipping Chelsea for the title. We might be doing the same with Arsenal come August if Wenger, who has been criticised for spending Arsenal\u2019s money like it\u2019s his own, is similarly ambitious. Arsenal, it should be stressed, are not in need of major surgery and the spine of their team is now much stronger than at any point last season, when they only just held off Everton\u2019s challenge to finish fourth. But there is still room for improvement. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger talks to his players ahead of extra time at Wembley last Saturday . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho looks in fine form during a press conference on Friday . Results have been impressive since David Ospina replaced Wojciech Szczesny, who had failed to show the required consistency. Ospina has played 12 Premier League games; Arsenal have won 11 and he has kept six clean sheets, but Wenger still needs to buy a new No 1 if they are to be title challengers. Petr Cech would be an ideal candidate to come in. Laurent Koscielny has steadied things in defence, with Arsenal winning 15 of the 18 games he\u2019s played since January 1 but, to progress, Wenger needs another top centre back. Gabriel Paulista arrived in the New Year but it seems it was to provide cover for Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Francis Coquelin has added bite to the midfield, but would Arsenal have enough to challenge next season if Coquelin is their anchor and Mikel Arteta is his back up? No. Why doesn\u2019t he go for Paul Pogba, who looks set to leave Juventus? Wenger spent \u00a342m on Mesut Ozil, so why not spend the same and more on Pogba. If they needed to sign Ozil two years ago, their need to sign Pogba this summer is even greater. Diego Godin of Atletico Madrid is 29 and at the peak of his powers. He would be ideal at the heart of the defence. Arsenal goalkeeper David Ospina pictured during a training session at London Colney last week . Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech warms up before Saturday's Premier League clash against Manchester United . Olivier Giroud, meanwhile, has provided a focal point up front. I like Giroud. He is an under-rated striker and, had he not missed three months with a broken ankle, his tally would be more than 14; he averages a goal every 101.93 minutes, the second best rate in the Premier League. Giroud is one of a number of good options Wenger has up front. Alexis Sanchez has been brilliant, while Danny Welbeck has played his part, but that should not stop Wenger looking to improve on what he has got. If a forward with the class of players he has had before, such as Thierry Henry or Nicolas Anelka, comes on the market, Wenger would have to move for him. Imagine what Luis Suarez, Sergio Aguero or Karim Benzema could do for Arsenal? I\u2019m not saying Arsenal are getting to the levels of \u2018The Invincibles\u2019 but their form has me thinking they are getting closer. The 2-0 win at Manchester City in January could be a turning point. They made themselves difficult to beat rather than being open. Hopefully we will see more of this. Arsenal's French striker Olivier Giroud looks forward as he advances with the ball at Wembley . Danny Welbeck (left) looks to evade the challenge of Reading's Hal Robson-Kanu (centre) and Alex Pearce . Of course it has been frustrating that they have not challenged for the title since last winning it 11 years ago, and Wenger has not had a smooth ride. Fans turned on him after they lost at Stoke \u2014 and after the Champions League defeat to Monaco \u2014 leading to talk about Jurgen Klopp coming in. But some perspective is needed. Wenger has done a good job keeping Arsenal consistently in the top four \u2014 all their rivals have dropped out at some point in between \u2014 and by the end of next month, they could have won back-to-back FA Cups. How could you then get rid of Wenger? So one question would need asking: what are they waiting for? Both Manchester clubs will spend in the summer, but both those clubs have got far more problems to fix. City\u2019s squad is old and needs big investment, while United will have the complication of being back in Europe. Wenger, then, could use the next window to call it on. The message it would send out to his players, fans and, most significantly, their rivals would be huge. It would let everyone know they were launching an all-out assault on the title. They would have to be taken seriously. Beating Chelsea on Sunday won\u2019t alter things in the short term, but it will offer belief that Arsenal can challenge next season. What they do in the window will determine how big a statement they can make. Finding some special players could transform them.

Big guns missed out on a Fab freebie . Full marks to Aston Villa. They are a side rejuvenated by Tim Sherwood and absolutely deserved to beat Liverpool in the FA Cup semi-final. Jack Grealish understandably attracted most of the headlines for his outstanding performance but the role Fabian Delph played was just as important; his aggression, energy and left foot gives Villa balance in their midfield. Liverpool couldn\u2019t cope with his aggression. Earlier this season, Delph was lauded for committing his future to Villa even when their position in the Barclays Premier League was threatened. He signed a four-year deal, which showed his character could never be called into question. What can be called into question, however, is the wisdom of some other clubs in the Premier League.

Delph, do not forget, was set to be out of contract this summer and a number of sides at the top of the table had their chance to sign a young England international for free. No doubt these same clubs will go out when the window opens and bring in at least one foreign midfielder, to go with the ones they signed last summer, and soon enough we will hear at some point next season that we don\u2019t have enough English players playing for top sides competing in Europe. There will then be complaints from clubs saying it is impossible to buy English players because there is such a premium on them and they will argue that is why they are forced to look abroad for new signings. The Delph situation shows that sometimes such an argument is nonsense. He is now Villa\u2019s captain and has been their best player for the last 18 months. His progress has been so impressive he is now a regular in the England squad and if he can add more goals to his game \u2014 like the one he scored against Liverpool \u2014 he could reach a very high level. Delph slots the ball past Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet in Villa's 2-1 victory at Wembley . If Delph does maintain his improvement, inevitably clubs will come looking at him. But if they want him, it will cost. For reasons only they know, they let slip a chance to get something good for nothing. Their loss is most certainly Villa\u2019s gain.\n"]}

A police chief supports the police officer, who is ultimately exonerated, and a predominantly black community seethes with rage because it knows that an injustice was done. We've seen this movie before. Spoiler Alert: Cop gets away with it. Routine stops for walking in the middle of the street or driving with a broken taillight -- these should not result in anyone's death. But time and again it ends with a black man dead in the street and the community has no recourse. This time the stage was set in North Charleston, South Carolina, a city of about 100,000 people. Walter Scott was stopped by Officer Michael Slager for a broken taillight, and within minutes Scott was dead. According to the incident report, Slager said: \"Shots fired, and the subject is down. He took my Taser.\" His attorney at the time, David Aylor, said that Slager \"felt threatened and reached for his department-issued firearm and fired his weapon.\" But then came the video. We watched in horror as we saw Slager shoot Scott in the back multiple times. Then we saw Slager pick up something from one location and place it near Scott's lifeless body. On Tuesday, the officer was arrested on murder charges. North Charleston police Chief Eddie Driggers told reporters, \"I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw.\" Apparently so was Slager's attorney, who announced after the video was made public that he was no longer representing the officer. After the video became public, the officials in North Charleston deftly handled the situation. However, it was an easy case. There is no plausible evidence that Slager feared for his life when Scott is seen running away. In Ferguson, the video we have in the death of Michael Brown is of press conferences with police Chief Tom Jackson, who refused to release the police officer's name, but did release a video that appeared to show Michael Brown stealing cigars. We have the video of the military weapons deployed by the police in Ferguson that were trained on its residents and the press. The world seethed. North Charleston's police force is about 80% white, with a population of 47% black and 37% white in the city. Ferguson's police force is 94% white (only three of the 53 police officers are black), and the city is 67% black and 29% white. Both North Charleston and Ferguson have police forces that are not representative of the population they serve, yet because of a video North Charleston's police force got in front of the story. I'm not sure North Charleston gets here without learning something from the mistakes of Ferguson. I have heard many commentators say the North Charleston shooting doesn't have anything to do with race.  I don't buy it. I wonder how many whites in North Charleston with broken taillights get pulled over? Being pulled over for driving while black is a well-known phenomenon, which I discuss in my \"Critical Race Theory\" casebook. Racial profiling by Slager could have been the catalyst for Scott being pulled over in the first place. Yes, the North Charleston officials behaved differently than the officials in Ferguson. I don't think it's because race had nothing to do with it. It is that perhaps the North Charleston officials are better than those in Ferguson when it comes to racially charged situations -- especially given the instructive fallout from Brown's shooting. And, of course, the video. It remains to be seen whether Slager will be convicted of murder. Strange things can happen in a jury room. Recall how the Rodney King videotape allowed a Simi Valley, California, jury to acquit the Los Angeles police officers, but a federal jury later convicted the officers of violating King's civil rights. What a video proves can sometimes be in the eye of the beholder.\n"]}
{"question_id": 341, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: A rare insight into Manchester United's unpopular owners has lifted the lid on how they run the club. The man who spent six years as spokesman for the Glazer family has written an enlightening account of his time with the Manchester United chiefs. Tehsin Nayani's book, 'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', challenges popular perception about the US bosses who succeeded in a debt-burdening \u00a3800m takeover in 2005. Scroll down for video . Former spokesman for the Glazer family, Tehsin Nayani (left), has written the 'The Glazer Gatekeeper' Sir Bobby Charlton talks with Bryan Glazer, Joel Glazer and Avram Glazer (L-R) at Old Trafford in 2005 . The Glazers' takeover of Manchester United was met with huge protests by supporters in 2004 . In it, he claims: . \u2022 Malcolm Glazer had little to do with the takeover, leaving it to his sons . \u2022 The family were always in it for the long haul and wanted United to overtake Chelsea . \u2022 Son Joel Glazer refused to believe United fans could 'hate' them . \u2022 The 'Red Knights' who supposedly launched a buyout were never serious suitors . \u2022 Trusted manager Sir Alex Ferguson regularly invited the family into his dressing room . \u2022 The Glazers are 'not ogres' Nayani, who worked in finance PR in London, was brought on board by the Glazers before the takeover and served as the notoriously private family's spokesman until current executive vice chairman Ed Woodward sent him on his way in 2010. But across 323 pages he lifts the lid on the Florida-based owners who caused a ferocious storm when they seized control of the club and plunged it into debt, revealing a previously unseen human side. Nayani, who uses an anti-Glazer protest sticker as the logo for his book, states that the family were 'completely unruffled' by the mass protests that greeted their arrival and that the move was led by Malcolm Glazer's sons. 'Hundreds of angry protestors (surrounded by a heavy police presence) were filmed chanting 'Die Glazer, die!' he says, as the brothers made a hasty exit. But they were back to speak to staff the following day. Sir Alex Ferguson shares a joke with Avram Glazer, Joel Glazer and Bryan Glazer (L-R) in June, 2005 . A young United fan watches on as supporters protest ahead of the 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal . 'They seemed completely unruffled by the preceding night's events,' Nayani adds. Nayani reveals that the Glazers were huge fans of Ferguson and never considered sacking him, speaking of a close relationship between the Scot and the Americans and revealing that Ferguson ritually invited them into the dressing room. 'The Glazer brothers also spent twenty minutes or so with Sir Alex and the players in their dressing room,' he reflects. 'A post-match ritual they would fulfil each time they attended a game.' Following his own first meeting with the owners, in their plush Palm Beach office suites, Nayani states: 'The Glazers were not ogres \u2013 on the contrary they were an unusually down to earth, close-knit family. He adds: 'It was 'abundantly clear they were in it for the long-term and were committed to seeing the club regain its pre-eminence.' In 2010, with anti-Glazer sentiment arguably at its loudest following the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid for \u00a380m, Nayani recalls how he made a panicked call to Joel Glazer when he saw United legend David Beckham pick up a green and yellow scarf and wave it to the Stretford End following United's Champions League win over AC Milan, for whom he was playing at the time. The scarves, in the colours of United's original founders Newton Heath, were a symbol of protest worn by thousands but Glazer, who was watching on TV in Florida, appeared unconcerned. 'My adrenaline pumping, I immediately grabbed my BlackBerry, scrolled through my address book to 'JG' and pressed the green icon,' Nayani writes, adding that he was petrified Beckham would become the poster boy of the protestors. 'We don't know Beckham's motives for putting on the scarf,' he says Glazer told him. 'Also I'm not sure the publicity is necessarily bad. 'Football is a passionate business. Won't it blow over? Nayani claims that the Glazers did not sell Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid without Ferguson's approval . Malcolm Glazer, pictured in 2003, left his sons to complete the takeover, according to Nayani . 'Sure, some fans are angry and protesting inside Old Trafford. But from where I'm sitting there are many millions of fans who are just happy the team are through to the next round. They're supporters of Manchester United too. I get that some fans don't like us, but to hate us, it's such a strong word. To hate us when the club has been so successful, it's extraordinary.' Nayani adds that Joel Glazer became obsessed with football (and never called it soccer) thanks to an English, Tottenham Hostpur-supporting room-mate he had while at college. Aside from the family itself, the book contains a number of interesting anecdotes about the club's staff. Nayani recalls how a furious striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, who would soon leave for Real Madrid, reacted to being an unused substitute in the 2006 Carling Cup final thumping of Wigan Athletic. 'He contemptuously ripped his token winners' medal from around his neck before making an early exit from the dressing room, sweeping angrily past me as he did so,' he reveals. Nayani exposes the lengthy celebrations after the 2008 Champions League Final victory over Chelsea in Moscow, recalling that the party went on until 7.30am back at the hotel. 'At around 5am a huge breakfast buffet was laid on with chefs cooking up delicious made-to-order omelettes for their ravenous guests,' he writes. 'While we ate, David Gill and Sir Alex Ferguson gave touching speeches, interrupted frequently by loud cheering, everyone intoxicated by the sense of historic occasion.' Avram Glazer and Joel Glazer (L-R) watch United take on Burnley at Old Trafford earlier this season . The green and gold protests by United fans left the Glazer family 'completely unruffled', according to Nayani . Nayani adds that Ferguson cut a serene figure after the penalty shoot-out victory and found an unusual place to rest his weary legs. 'Sir Alex,' he writes, 'beaming like the Cheshire Cat, was sat alone literally on top of the padded silver crate, inside of which was the Champions League trophy.' He adds that Ferguson even failed to give an unnamed player who had forgotten his passport the famous hairdryer treatment, saying simply: 'Oh dear, why have you gone and done that, lad?' Nayani says that the club felt a 'palpable sense of injustice' after it emerged they would not be able to parade the trophy on a open-top bus journey through Manchester after booze-fuelled Rangers fans had rioted in the city during their Uefa Cup Final defeat earlier that season. The author also recalls players sleeping on the floor of a plane with uncomfortable seats on a pre-season trip to Asia, where he inadvertently tripped up Ferguson with his suitcase in a Chinese airport. 'I immediately turned to look over my shoulder and saw that it was, in fact, Sir Alex Ferguson himself who had become entangled with my case,' he writes. 'Horrified, I was immediately seized with fear and remorse. I apologised to him profusely and enquired after his welfare; fortunately he was not hurt and he was immediately forgiving.' Nayani dismisses suggestions Real Madrid went over Ferguson and Gill's heads to do the Ronaldo deal. United fans burn a Malcolm Glazer dummy during a protest outside Old Trafford in May, 2005 . He adds that when the decision was made to sell it was because the player wanted to move on and the owners 'after a long spell of soul searching by manager Sir Alex Ferguson, would accept this'. Nayani says that in 2010, with a rumoured bid from the Red Knights (a group of well-off United-supporting businessmen) reportedly in the offing, the Glazers commissioned a stack of fresh market research to investigate supporters' attitudes towards them as well as the Red Knights and were pleased with the results. He reiterates that there was no desire among the family to sell and says no bid was forthcoming. Nayani reserves fierce criticism for Wayne Rooney's now-infamous 2010 interview in which he stated Gill had failed to give him the reassurances he sought about United's 'ability to attract the top players in the world'. 'It was a crudely-disguised dig at the Glazers' ownership,' he writes, before adding that Joel Glazer had spoken to Rooney by telephone reassuring him about his ambitions for the club before a new contract was offered. Nayani, who was left out of the loop on the Rooney situation, sensed he was nearing the end of his time with the club with protests easing off and at a meeting shortly afterwards with Ed Woodward, his fate was sealed with a 'generous golden handshake'. Tehsin Nayani's book,\u00a0'The Glazer Gatekeeper: six years speaking for Manchester United's silent owners', is available on Amazon.\n"]}

The former premier made an unannounced visit to Ulaanbataar last month in his capacity as a consultant to the cash-strapped government, which is dogged by allegations of endemic corruption. He met new Mongolian prime minister Chimed Saikhanbileg but the secrecy surrounding his trip stoked fears from ecologists and the opposition that he is being deployed to encourage Western investment to the country to massively increase gold, copper and coal mining, despite acute environmental worries. Scroll down for video . Tony Blair with a Mongolian dignitary on his recent visit. The former British premier has been dragged into a row over gold mining plans which could destroy the ancient graves of Attila the Hun's warrior ancestors . A silver plate from the Noyon Uul burials, where some of the ancestors of Attila the Hun (right) are buried . An excavation at Noyon Uul. Ecologists fear a mining boom in the region could destroy sacred treasures . Specifically, there is concern over plans for development of the sacred pine-covered Noyon Uul region around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar which has \u00a31.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation, dating back to the first century BC. 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn, citing official sources. The news outlet - which claimed Blair had flown 'secretly' to Mongolia last week - also speculated he was advising on another controversial project, involving expansion of multinational Rio Tinto's Oyu Tolgoi mine in the Gobi Desert, and a possible bailout from the IMF. Atilla was a feared fifth century barbarian warrior who ruled the Hunnic Empire from the Urals to the Rhine. He was born in modern-day Hungary, but his fearsome forebears are seen as originating much further east, in Mongolia. Activists from ecological pressure groups including Save Noyon Uul have protested to the government that plans for a foreign mining company to exploit gold reserves 'will destroy the historical monuments of the Mongols and their ancestors. 'Driven to despair, they promised that if the Mongolian government allows mining in the sacred land of the Mongols, its defenders are ready to give their lives to save Noyon Uul', said one report last week. Mr Blair's visit to\u00a0Ulaanbataar was not noted on his website. His office said he makes regular Mongolia trips . Noyon Uul is around 65 miles north of Ulaanbaatar and has \u00a31.2 billion gold reserves but is dotted with the burial mounds of the rulers of the ancient Hun civilisation dating back to the first century BC . 'Tony Blair probably came to us because the strategic deposits in the mountain Noyon Uul are the centre of attention,' reported local news source 24 Tsag.mn . Silver decorations for a harness recovered from the burial site. It has up to 200 burial mounds . The Mongolian premier - who recruited Blair to Mongolia two years ago when he held the position of cabinet minister - is seen as the leading advocate of the plan to boost mining in several regions, including Noyon Uul, where Canadian company Centerra Gold may be given the go-ahead to exploit significant reserves. He lunched with the former Labour Party leader after he held a 'text message referendum', dismissed as a cheap gimmick by foes, aimed at garnering support for new mining to boost the flagging economy. The country's president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj has 'a strong stance against mining of Noyen Uul and wants to leave the cultural heritage site intact', evidently contrary to the position of his prime minister, it was reported. There was no mention of the Mongolian trip on the official website of The Office of Tony Blair, nor any comment from the Ulaanbaatar government on whether his work includes advice on exploiting 50 tons of gold reserves. But Mongolia is under severe pressure to raise revenue from mining to head off an economic crisis after foreign investment slumped 74 per cent last year, with speculation also centering on Tavan Tolgoi, one of the world's largest untapped coal deposits in the South Gobi Desert. Tony Blair Associates one year ago hired Anand Pillai, formerly an adviser to Rio Tinto in Mongolia. Noted Russian scientist Natalia Polosmak - who has made sensational archeological discoveries at Noyon Uul - said: 'This was the burial ground of the Hun elite. Tony Blair takes part in discussions during his visit. He was recruited to work with Mongolia two years ago .

'The collection of fabrics that we found there is unique.' Among the precious finds were elaborate chariots buried with Hun warlords, unique fabrics, ancient jewellery, plaques decorated in silver and gold, and carvings of fantastical creatures. A spokesperson from Mr Blair's office said: 'Tony Blair regularly visits Mongolia as part of his project there - which is already in the public domain - and has a full time team working on helping the government with its reform programme. 'He has nothing whatever to do with any gold mining business or other mining there so we don't know what is being referred to.' A spokesman for Centerra Gold, referring to the company's Gatsuurt mine in the\u00a0Noyon Uul region, said: 'Our Gatsuurt property has been designated as a deposit of strategic importance. 'We are continuing to work with the government to determine the level of Mongolian ownership in the project and before Gatsuurt can proceed.

{"question_id": 344, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: With 20 goals to his name this season, Watford captain Troy Deeney is regarded by many as the best striker outside the Premier League. In fact, Deeney has been lighting up the Championship for the last three seasons, scoring 64 goals in 123 league games at an average of over a goal every other game. The next logical step for the Birmingham-born striker is the top flight and, with Watford just a point off the top of the table with five games to go, he could well be skippering the Hornets in the Premier League next season. Watford striker Troy Deeney won the Championship's Player of the Month award for March . Hornets skipper Deeney is hoping to cap off a fine season by leading Watford to the Premier League . Deeney believes he can follow in the path of Charlie Austin and Danny Ings  by becoming a Premier League hit . Watford are currently just one point behind Championship leaders Bournemouth with five games left to play . And Deeney, who was this week named the Sky Bet Championship player of the month for March, makes no secret of his desire to test himself at the highest level. He said: 'I've looked at Charlie Austin, Danny Ings, Rickie Lambert and Grant Holt before that. 'These are all people that have been in the Championship, done well, then held their own in the Premier League. 'There is a sign there that you can really go on (from the Championship). If you go in and apply yourself then you can score goals. 'I want to make sure that when I go up there I'm ready for it and I show what I'm about.' It seems fair for Deeney to say 'when' and not 'if' he plays at the top level because on this season's evidence he and striker partner Odion Ighalo certainly are ready for it. Between them the Championship's most lethal strikeforce have scored 39 league goals this season and Deeney waxed lyrical about his Nigerian strike partner. 'He's a natural finisher,' he said. 'Before Saturday (when Ighalo scored from 20 yards in the win over Middlesbrough) we had been joking that all of his goals were inside the 18-yard box. 'He's definitely a poacher and when he scores he normally scores doubles, one game he got four. He scores in bunches which is a sign of a real good striker.' Deeney is adamant that together he and Ighalo could terrorise Premier League defences. 'I've been and watched a few games this season and I don't see why not,' he said. Watford striker\u00a0Odion Ighalo has also been in fine goalscoring form during the course of the campaign . Deeney has been impressed with\u00a0Slavisa Jokanovic since the\u00a0Watford manager took charge in October . 'I think you have to be very ruthless in the Premier League and we've shown that we can score goals. 'Are we confident we can do it? Definitely.' Watford - currently third in the table and kept out of the top two only on goal difference - joined the promotion-chasing pack late after a turbulent start to the season saw three managers depart before current boss Slavisa Jokanovic took charge in October. But referring to that period Deeney, who has played under seven managers since joining Watford from Walsall in 2010, insists: 'It wasn't that bad.' He added: 'It definitely brought the players closer together. 'It's just one of those things really, in any line of work if your manager changes your job doesn't change.' Watford have won 15 of Jokanovic's 27 matches in charge and Deeney has been impressed by the Serbian's tactical flexibility. Ahead of Saturday's trip to Millwall, he said: 'We've got a talented squad so we can go from 4-4-2 to 4-4-2 diamond to 3-5-2 or 4-3-3. 'His (Jokanovic's) adaptability would be the one thing that makes him stand out.' Former Watford boss\u00a0Beppe Sannino handed Deeney the captain's armband during his brief spell in charge . But Deeney's role in the revival of Watford's season, not just as goalscorer but as captain, cannot be underestimated. Beppe Sannino made him captain before the start of the season and Deeney seems to have taken to the role like a duck to water. 'I was very vocal anyway,' he said. 'If I've got something to say I'm going to say it anyway, good or bad, and I think that once people know me they respect that. 'If you're doing good I'll tell you you're doing good, if you're doing wrong I'll tell you you're doing wrong. I don't expect anything else of others towards myself. 'The added responsibility of now having to lead even more by example, I think that's the only that's changed. 'But then I think I did it pretty well beforehand, I think that's why they made me captain. They know what I'm about and what I offer. 'But now it's a case of justifying why they have made that decision.' Deeney served three months in prison for affray in 2012 and says it is no coincidence he has enjoyed by far the best three seasons of his career since his release. Deeney has warned his Watford team-mates they have 'three weeks of hard work' ahead of them . 'The two are definitely linked,' he admits. 'But it's more down to personal growth and realising what an opportunity I had, instead of being an idiot and just letting my chance go by. 'I've just grasped it with both hands and become a better footballer and a better person for it, so it (prison) was probably a blessing in disguise.' Captaining Watford in the Premier League next season, Deeney admits, would be the crowning glory after three years' hard work following his release. 'That would be the fairytale ending,' said the 26-year-old. 'But we've got three weeks of hard work before we can even start thinking about that, so I'm just going to keep working and hopefully that fairytale can come true.' You get the feeling Deeney will be playing in the Premier League regardless of what happens in the next few weeks. But  Watford have as good a chance as any of promotion with their talismanic captain in the side.\n"]}

One million children urgently in need of help. Those are the startling numbers that indicate the scale of the devastation from the huge earthquake that struck the Himalayan nation on Saturday. And some of the grim figures are likely to get even worse as hopes of rescuing any more survivors diminish every hour. Heartbreaking scenes of suffering and loss are playing out across this shell-shocked nation as it reels from its deadliest natural disaster in more than 80 years. As the country coped with the fallout of the quake, another natural disaster struck Tuesday afternoon in a popular trekking area north of Kathmandu, and up to 200 people were feared missing as a result of a landslide, a trekking association official said. It happened around 4 p.m. in Langtang National Park, said Ramesh Dhamala, president of the Trekking Agents of Nepal. Laxmi Dhakal, spokesman for Nepal's Home Ministry, said  he was aware of reports about the landslide but wasn't immediately able to confirm details. Quake relief efforts continued Tuesday, but officials warned that they were hampered by problems of getting aid into the country and then delivering it to some of the remote communities in desperate need. In Kathmandu, a capital city of shattered temples and toppled houses, some people paid their last respects to loved ones taken by the quake. By the Bagmati River, which winds through the city, more than a dozen funeral pyres burned Monday. As workers stoked the flames for the Hindu cremation ceremonies, some mourners shaved their heads in a traditional show of mourning from children who lose their parents. Alongside their father, two teenage brothers from the Gurung family, Ishan and Iman, said goodbye to their mother, Ishara. \"We never imagined this would happen to us. This much pain,\" said Ishan, the elder of the two. Elsewhere in the city, many shaken residents are sleeping in the open. Some have lost their homes, others are afraid to stay in buildings that may be vulnerable to aftershocks. Large encampments of tents have sprung up in open areas, including a wide space belonging to the military in the center of the city that is typically used for parades. One of the grand gates to the field is now just a pile of rubble. Kisnor Raj Giri, a 22-year-old man from Kathmandu who lost members of his extended family in the quake, said he was too scared to return home. He is camping out at the military grounds with thousands of others even though frequent rain has made the nights an ordeal. \"Many people are crying, sharing their hardships,\" he told CNN on Monday evening. The elements showed no mercy to the homeless masses on Tuesday as thunderstorms rumbled over Kathmandu. More bad weather is forecast for the region in the coming days. But in one piece of good news, Turkish and Chinese rescue crews helped pull free a 21-year-old man trapped under rubble near a city bus park in a 13-hour rescue operation. Houses and families ripped apart by earthquake . The death toll has now climbed above 4,600 in Nepal, officials said Tuesday evening, as rescue and relief efforts continue. Nepal army Lt. Col. A. J. Thapa told CNN's Sumnima Udas that the first 72 hours after the earthquake is the time when the most lives can be saved. \"This is not the time to rest and lament,\" he said. \"This is the time to go out and save lives.\" Thapa said an entire military post was lost during an avalanche. \"Remember we are not an outside force that has been parachuted into an area to help,\" he said. \"We are victim ourselves. ... Despite the fact that soldiers have their families and houses are down, we are trying to build morale, maintain morale and help themselves.\" Thapa said it was fortunate that the quake struck during daylight on a weekend. \"Children were not trapped in big schools somewhere and lot of people were outside because it was daytime,\" he said. Dhakal, the Home Ministry spokesman, put the death toll at 4,620, while Nepal's National Emergency Coordination Center said the number of dead was 4,727. Both sources gave the number of people injured as 9,239. Another 72 people died in India, while China reported 25 deaths. Most of the casualty numbers in Nepal are believed to have come mainly from Kathmandu and the surrounding area. They are expected to climb as information emerges from remote areas. \"We have incomplete information, but we apprehend the death toll will go up,\" Nepalese Information Minister Minendra Rijal told CNN earlier on Tuesday. \"We cannot say by how much exactly.\" The news agency Reuters cited Prime Minister Sushil Koirala as saying that the toll could reach 10,000 and that the country was \"on a war footing\" in its rescue and relief work. In a live, televised address to the nation, the Prime Minister said the country had been stunned by the disaster and announced three days of national mourning, starting Tuesday. The government's first priority is to continue search and rescue operations and relief efforts, he said, as he thanked all those involved. Historic and religious monuments destroyed by the earthquake will be reconstructed in time, he added. At least 90% of 96,000 Nepali army troops have been deployed in relief and rescue operations, according to Nepal army spokesman Jagadish Chandra Pokharel. More than 15 countries and agencies have already promised help, Koirala said, as he appealed for other nations also to come to Nepal's aid. Even as international aid pours into the country, overwhelmed hospitals are lacking vital medical supplies, people remain buried in the wreckage of buildings and rescuers are struggling to reach hard-hit rural areas near the quake's epicenter. \"The biggest problem is reaching these villages,\" Matt Darvas, an emergency communications officer for the humanitarian group World Vision, told CNN from Gorkha district, northwest of Kathmandu. Nepal struggles to cope with international aid . Nepali Home Ministry Joint Secretary Sagar Mani Parajuli, who is coordinating relief efforts, said government efforts to get aid to remote areas had been hampered by rugged terrain and poor weather, which limits the use of helicopters. \"The helicopters are small. They don't fly in windy and cloudy conditions. Given Nepal's geographical terrain, we cannot use surface transport much but are using it,\" he said. \"We need 150,000 tents and tarpaulins, but we don't have enough of them.\" Jamie McGoldrick, the U.N. resident coordinator for Nepal, told a news conference Tuesday that bringing in relief materials has been difficult because Kathmandu's international airport, which has just one runway and space for only a limited number of aircraft to park, is log jammed. The United Nations is aware of the request for tents, he said, but is working to procure high quality ones to withstand the expected monsoon rains. Of the 8 million people affected by the quake across 39 districts of Nepal, some 1.4 million need food aid, McGoldrick added. Nepal's population is about 31 million. At an event in Paris, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed his condolences to the people of Nepal and called the humanitarian needs \"huge and urgent.\" \"The United Nations is supporting international operations for search and rescue and strengthening relief efforts,\" he said. \"I count on the generosity of the international community in Nepal's hour of need and the longer term rebuilding efforts that will be needed.\" A CNN team that joined a Nepalese military helicopter flight to Dhulikhel, a rural area east of Kathmandu, saw extensive damage in the Kathmandu Valley from the air, including many landslides. On landing, the team went to a hospital where all the injured from six surrounding districts are being brought. More than 1,000 people are currently in the hospital -- three times its usual capacity -- so some of the injured are being left out in the streets. Social media posts from Nepal . Darvas of World Vision said he had been told of frightening levels of damage in villages in the region surrounding Gorkha district, which is near the earthquake's epicenter. They included one where 35 out of 45 homes were destroyed and another where 70% of the houses had collapsed, trapping and crushing the people inside, most of them children and the elderly. Even though aid groups and Nepalese officials are aware of critical situations in areas spread across Nepal's mountainous terrain, they face daunting challenges getting help to them. \"Some of those villages -- several years ago, before there was vehicle transport -- used to take seven days to reach. Roads are shut now to some of those villages, so we can only imagine how long it will take to get there,\" Darvas said Monday. He said injured people who had been airlifted from some remote areas were often suffering from crush injuries, lacerations and dislocations. Looking for missing loved ones in Nepal? CNN iReport wants to help . UNICEF, the U.N. children's agency, said Sunday that nearly 1 million Nepalese children urgently need assistance. Aid groups and at least 16 nations rushed aid and workers to Nepal, with more on the way. High-altitude rescue efforts have also been undertaken on the difficult terrain of Mount Everest, where the earthquake released deadly avalanches. Four U.S. citizens are among those who died on Everest, according to officials and relatives. Damage to climbing infrastructure on the mountain, not to mention the overall situation in Nepal, means the climbing season is over for the year, climber Jim Davidson told CNN from the Everest base camp, where he was evacuated after spending two days on the mountain.

If the reports from Spanish paper Mundo Deportivo prove true, Puyol could join up with Manchester City midfielder Frank Lampard in the States or with his former long-term team-mate Xavi, who is expected to move to Qatar with Al-Sadd. The curly-haired centre back had hinted on his retirement that he would consider a return to the game had it not been for the knee injury that plagued the tail-end of his career. 'I don't think I'll be a coach, it's not what I'd like most,' Puyol said in May. 'Maybe I'll change my mind but for now I want to do other things.'

Xavi, Puyol's former team-mate, is said to considering a move to Al-Sadd and Puyol could join him there . David Villa is now playing for New York City. Frank Lampard will join him soon and Puyol could be next . The former Barca skipper was named as the club's assistant director of football but he left that role in January when Andoni Zubizarreta, his senior, was fired. Xavi visited Qatar in the last international break ahead of a rumoured move at the end of his Barcelona contract which would see the midfield metronome earn around \u00a37million-a-year, and Puyol could choose a similar route. Alternatively, a New York move would see Puyol join the City Football Group alongside Chelsea legend Lampard and another former team-mate of Puyol's, David Villa.\n"]}

{"question_id": 350, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Five years ago, Rebecca Francis posed for a photo while lying next to a dead giraffe. This week, she got threatened for her action. The trouble started Monday, when comedian Ricky Gervais tweeted the photo with a question. \"What must've happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal & then lie next to it smiling?\" Gervais wrote. In the past three days, his tweet has been retweeted almost 30,000 times. A number of people insulted and threatened Francis in response to the giraffe photo and others featuring her. On the website rebeccafrancis.com, there are photos of Francis with other animals, including a lion, which other Twitterers responded to. Francis, who has appeared on the NBC Sports Network outdoor lifestyle show \"Eye of the Hunter\" and was the subject of an interview with Hunting Life in late March, responded in a statement to HuntingLife.com on Tuesday, which was posted on its Facebook page. The death came about, she said, because she was asked by others on an African hunt to \"preserve\" him for the local people. \"(The locals) showed me this beautiful old bull giraffe that was wandering all alone. He had been kicked out of the herd by a younger and stronger bull. He was past his breeding years and very close to death,\" she said. \"They asked me if I would preserve this giraffe by providing all the locals with food and other means of survival. ... I chose to honor his life by providing others with his uses and I do not regret it for one second. (The locals) did not waste a single part of him. I am grateful to be a part of something so good.\" According to the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, there are about 80,000 giraffes in Africa, a decline of 60,000 in the past 15 years. On a website called rebeccafrancis.com, where the photo is posted, Francis describes herself as a longtime outdoors enthusiast and a fan of bow-hunting. \"I prefer bowhunting, and the animals I have taken with a bow include: a 10 1/2 ft. brown bear, black bear, shiras moose, alaskan moose,  dall sheep, stone sheep, desert bighorn ram, rocky mountain bighorn ram, mule deer, whitetail deer, elk, mountain goat, antelope, arapawa ram, kudu, zebra, black wildebeest, giraffe, springbuck, blesbuck, lynx, badger, and squirrel,\" she writes. \"I have also taken many of the same species and more with a rifle.\" She has achieved the \"Full Curl of North American sheep\" with a bow, according to the Hunting Life interview, and hopes to achieve the \"Super 10.\" The latter, according to liveoutdoors.com, \"entails the taking of one animal from the ten basic North American species: bears, cats, deer, elk, caribou, moose, bison/muskox, goat, antelope and sheep.\" Tom Opre, the producer and co-host of \"Eye of the Hunter,\" says she won the first season of \"Extreme Huntress,\" an online offshoot of \"Eye,\" and co-hosted a handful of \"Eye\" episodes.

Goals from Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil and Alexis Sanchez put the Gunners 3-0 ahead, before Jordan Henderson pulled one back from the penalty spot for the visitors. Olivier Giroud completed the scoreline with a sumptuous strike in injury time. Here,\u00a0Sportsmail's Matt Barlow casts his eye over the two teams' performances at the Emirates. Arsenal (4-2-3-1) DAVID OSPINA - 6.5 . No shots to save first half, although out smartly once or twice. Made a flying save to thwart Can in the second-half and almost saved Jordan Henderson's penalty. HECTOR BELLERIN - 6.5 . Scored a wonderful goal with his left foot. Unfortunate to be booked for a foul by Mathieu Flamini and then lucky not to be sent off for a foul on Sterling which conceded penalty. Hector Bellerin celebrates after putting Arsenal 1-0 ahead against Liverpool in the first half on Saturday . PER MERTESACKER - 6.5 . Coped quite well with the nimble trio of Liverpool strikers. LAURENT KOSCIELNY - 6 . Performed well until replaced early in second half by Gabriel. NACHO MONREAL - 7 . Solid defensive display, up against Lazar Markovic and Philippe Coutinho. FRANCIS COQUELIN - 7 . Offered vital bite in midfield, especially during period midway through first half when Liverpool were at their best. Alexis Sanchez celebrates after netting the Gunners third on the stroke of half-time at the Emirates . SANTI CAZORLA - 6.5 . Heavily involved in the middle of midfield, but without any of the creative frills which often decorate this game. Early shot forced a save. Hit a post late in game. AARON RAMSEY - 7 . Started very well, wide on the right. Missed a good chance after a Kolo Toure mistake and set-up Alexis Sanchez's goal with a neat touch. Faded and replaced early. ALEXIS SANCHEZ - 7 . All action as ever, including a fabulous strike before half time make it 3-0. MESUT OZIL - 7.5 . Produced silky touches and a brilliant free-kick for the second which put Arsenal in control. Mesut Ozil added a glorious second for Arsenal with a sumptuous free-kick on 40 minutes . Ozil was all smiles as he celebrated his strike in a silky personal display from the midfielder . Ozil (right) posted on Instagram after the match: 'Seven wins in a row! and so happy!' OLIVIER GIROUD - 7 . Forced early mistake from Toure which his team failed to capitalise on. Denied in the second half by a good reflex save. Scored the fourth with another stunner. SUBS: GABRIEL (for Koscielny 49 min); FLAMINI (for Ramsey), WELBECK (for Ozil) Subs not used: Macey, Gibbs, Rosicky, Walcott. MANAGER: ARSENE WENGER - 7 . Wonderful first half for the Arsenal boss, but his team do not have the knack of killing a game. There will always be chances to score. Sent on Flamini in a bid to protect the clean sheet, but Liverpool got one back. Olivier Giroud (right) added a late fourth with a brilliant strike to complete the scoreline for the Gunners . Liverpool (3-4--2-1) SIMON MIGNOLET - 5.5 . Beaten three times in eight minutes before the break, but made fine early saves from Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey as well as a splendid reaction save from Olivier Giroud in the second half. EMRE CAN - 5 . Not comfortable on the right of three centre-halves or at right-back where he played after the break. Sent off for two yellow cards, the second a stupid tackle from behind on Danny Welbeck, near the corner flag. Emre Can (right) was sent off late in the second half for Liverpool to compound a miserable afternoon . Liverpool's Kolo Toure (centre) had a torrid afternoon in defence on his return to his former club . KOLO TOURE - 4.5 . Error-strewn performance defined Liverpool\u2019s first-half. Escaped an early mistake which gave Ramsey a chance but not others. Better in back four in second half. MAMADOU SAKHO - 5 . Erratic as if disturbed playing alongside Toure in absence of Martin Skrtel. JORDAN HENDERSON - 6 . Did not contribute a great deal from right-wing-back in the first half, but more involved when he moved forward in the second half. Scored from the spot and returned to right-back after Emre Can\u2019s red card. Jordan Henderson pulled one back for the Reds from the penalty spot on 79 minutes at the Emirates . JOE ALLEN - 6 . Ticked over in midfield. Won some tackles and passed it well, but did not protect his defence when they needed help. LUCAS LEIVA - 5.5 . First start in two months and very sluggish and wasteful in the early exchanges. Like Joe Allen, better in second half, but the game had gone by this point. ALBERTO MORENO - 5.5 . Offered nothing in attack and unreliable in defence. Easily beaten by Hector Bellerin for the opening goal. LAZAR MARKOVIC - 5 . Flickered on the counter-attack but opted to pass to Sterling when clean through and ought to have shot. Replaced at half-time. Lazar Markovic (left) wasted a glorious chance to give Liverpool the lead and was substituted at half-time . PHILIPPE COUTINHO - 5 . Unable to impose himself. One pass to Markovic created a first-half chance. Nice touches, here and there but nothing more. RAHEEM STERLING - 6 . Bright and well poised on the ball. Movement good and influential when moved to the left after the break. Won penalty. Liverpool won the penalty after Raheem Sterling (top) was fouled by Bellering (bottom) in the second half . SUBS: DANIEL STURRIDGE (HT for Markovic) Liverpool were better with him on. 6. Subs not used: Jones, Johnson, Lovren, Manquillo, Brannagan, Borini. MANAGER: BRENDAN RODGERS - 6 . Awful first half for his team in absence of  Skrtel and Steven Gerrard. Started badly, improved a little but beaten by three terrific goals in eight minutes. Switched from back-three to back-four to try and get back into the match as well as sending Daniel Sturridge on in response. But it was over when Can was dismissed. REFEREE: ANTHONY TAYLOR - 6.5 . There were mistakes and he missed small things, but overall let it flow. Got the penalty right and the red card, but made a mess of Bellerin\u2019s cards.\n"]}

In 2007, a 29-year-old karaoke performer was shot dead at a bar in San Mateo for delivering an off-key rendition of My Way. There followed a spate of copycat killings provoked by inadequate attempts at the song. The death toll now as high as 12, many clubs have taken My Way\u00a0off their playlist. Manny Pacquiao need not worry. He already has two platinum albums to his name back home. And that\u2019s the thing; in a country where the line \u2018and now the end is near\u2019 can have literal truth if delivered out of tune, Pacquiao\u2019s voice really isn\u2019t particularly special. His jokes aren\u2019t always zingers, either, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him having his own sitcom, Show Me Da Manny, plus a game show, Manny Many Prizes\u00a0on the GMA Network. Manny Pacquiao recorded his own song for when he takes to the ring for his fight with Floyd Mayweather . This screenshot shows Pacquiao playing it for laughs in his sitcom Show Me Da Manny . Pacquiao also has a quiz show called Manny Many Prizes . He is being pursued for \u00a333m in unpaid taxes but remains a twice-elected and popular congressman and if he ran for president would win by a landslide.\u00a0He is just over 5ft 6in but doubles as the player-coach of a professional basketball team, the Kia Carnival. His birthday is celebrated like a national holiday, and there is a truce in the civil war to the south of the country whenever he fights. Each April, in Cebu City, the battle of Mactan is re-enacted, when Philippine warrior Datu Lapu-Lapu repelled the conquistador forces of Magellan. In previous years, the role of Lapu-Lapu has been played by Pacquiao; as this year he was in training to fight Floyd Mayweather, they merely dedicated the performance to him instead. There is no point comparing Pacquiao with sporting contemporaries because there is no-one like him. Tiger Woods, at his peak, moved Wall Street. If he won a tournament on the Sunday, the markets were more confident and buoyant the following morning. To influence the biggest economy in the free world is beyond Pacquiao, true. Yet what does it say of Woods? That he was corporate America\u2019s poster boy. Drive five minutes from the azalea-skirted fairways of Augusta National and it is possible to find whole communities entirely untouched by the Tiger phenomenon, no matter the racial boundaries broken. Pacquiao, in his own land, is different. Pacquiao is the people\u2019s champion. Whatever the state of his accounts, he still pays 64 per cent more tax than any other citizen in the Philippines. He builds hospitals, his wealth fights natural disasters. The crime rate plummets when he fights, his country stops, roads clear. May 3 \u2013 the date of the Mayweather bout in Pacquiao\u2019s homeland \u2013 has already been declared a national holiday, and there, the world\u2019s richest fight can be viewed free. No pay-per-view in Manila. Temporary paper billboards will be erected on street corners, plazas and in church grounds, so that crowds can watch the action direct from Las Vegas. The judges\u2019 scores will be shown via Skype. No other sportsman would command this level of attention in one country; Pacquiao\u2019s fame has transcended the boxing ring. Pacquiao's fan rally was another moment for the small screen as the ring legend took a selfie at the event . Size doesn't seem to matter when Pacquiao takes to the basketball court - well, it's his team . As a pious Roman Catholic \u2013 his bible is never far from his side, its most affecting passages highlighted in pink \u2013 he would not welcome the allusion, but the devotion he inspires is that of a pontiff. It is papal, the love that follows him in the Philippines; his people would chair him through the streets if they could. On a more earthbound level, he is Rudolph Valentino, The Beatles or pre-ignominy Michael Jackson, a star beyond familiar experience. Mayweather is a boxer; a great boxer, a very wealthy boxer, but a boxer, still. Pacquiao, while being the underdog in pure sporting terms on Saturday, is somehow more. He has been elevated to higher ground. At the South Convention Centre of the Mandalay Bay hotel in Las Vegas, the Filipiniana Dance Company of Las Vegas (Est. 2001) is on its third number. Corralled behind steel barriers, a crowd \u2013 bemused, impatient \u2013 are waiting to see one man. Instead, they are being treated to a second-rate talent show. Filipino singers replace the Filipiniana dancers and two unfunny MC\u2019s try desperately to drum up frenzy. 'He\u2019s in the building,' they scream which, as Pacquiao actually checked into the resort on Monday, is hardly an earth-shattering development. When he arrives, the contrast between the hype and the human is immediate, the sincerity of the figure in the white tee and camel coloured trousers smiling sweetly at the crowd, quite obvious. They wave back: national flags and home-made banners. One shows a hungry Pac-man eating a dollar sign. Later, in the Panda Room \u2013 strangely appropriate, pandas are bears yet are seen as benign, cuddly creatures \u2013 Pacquiao\u2019s effect on those of Philippine descent is clear. The Filipiniana dancers file in and crowd the aisles. Every time Pacquiao speaks they giggle like smitten schoolgirls. An endless string of selfies are taken, until they begin teasing each other about their faux-teenage crushes. One of the dancers is given a souvenir boxing glove by a pressman. Nothing unique, just a memento that could be bought at any local sports shop or in the foyer of the hotel, a commemorative glove with the fight\u2019s logo and date embossed on the mitt, yet she stares at it as if presented with a holy relic until broken from her reverie by the sound of more squeals as another image is committed to digital memory; laughing girls in the foreground, Pacquiao a smudge in the distance. But, still, that\u2019s him. Pacquiao addressed his fans, the ones in Vegas anyway, at the Mandalay Bay Hotel on Tuesday . Filipino dancers were part of the entertainment during the fan rally for Pacquiao . Manny mania was in full swing with just a few days to go before he enters the ring in Las Vegas . Mayweather had dancers of his own for his arrival at the MGM Grand just along the famous Strip . It is fair to say there are few middle-class boxers but even by the standards of a working man\u2019s sport, Pacquiao\u2019s story is exceptional. Mayweather grew up poor, but it was first-world poor; the electricity might have been cut off, and his family sometimes slept seven to a room, but there were safety nets, checks and balances. There was always a roof and no-one went hungry. Pacquiao is a third-world survivor. He was born in General Santos City, 600 miles south of the capital Manila, a part of the region now consumed by terrorism. Pacquiao knew tin-shanty poverty, hungry-every-day poverty, bare-foot poverty; he knew what it was to be filthy poor, unable to bathe, dirty, unschooled. His father abandoned the family when Manny was small, came home unannounced one day, killed, cooked and ate his dog, and then left again. When Pacquiao departed for the capital it wasn\u2019t out of up-by-the-bootstraps ambition, but basic human necessity. His family couldn\u2019t feed him; but maybe he could feed himself. He slept rough, he sold doughnuts for loose change and fought in the back streets for little more \u2013 sometimes the purse was the equivalent of \u00a31. The iconic black and white images that have since emerged of Pacquiao at his Manila gym at the age of 17 were taken three years after he arrived in the capital, and 10 fights into his professional career. Even then, he looks scrawny, raw, unpolished \u2013 a street kid as much as a street fighter. It is hard to reconcile those haunted eyes with the figure who will march confidently towards the ring at the MGM Grand on Saturday, to the sound of his own voice. These images of a 17-year-old Pacquiao training in Manila were published ahead of the big fight . Pacquiao left his home as a 14-year-old and headed for Manila, the capital of the Philippines . Pacquiao turned professional aged 16 and had 10 fights by the time these images were taken . Pacquiao, as befits a platinum-selling game show host, basketball player turned singer-politician and world welterweight champion, has brought out a song for this fight called Lalaban Ako Para Sa Pilipino\u00a0, which translates as \u2018I will fight for the Filipinos\u2019. 'Even if I am in pain,' Pacquiao sings, 'I force myself to hide it and be silent. My heart is bleeding yet others don\u2019t see it, but what is important is that my country is happy.

But a new report released today reveals that it is in fact younger people who feel more lonely than older generations - despite being more connected to their friends online. The survey, funded by the Big Lottery, found that more than 80 per cent of young people feel lonely at some point. Scroll down for video . Chloe Jackson, 19, appeared on today's This Morning to talk about how Facebook makes her feel lonely . The research revealed that half of those aged 55 and over said they never felt lonely. In comparison, 43 per cent of 18 to 34-year-olds admitted they wished they had more friends. A third of the under 34-year-olds said they found it hard to make new friends and they didn't know how to form new friendships. Many admitted they were more likely to interact with friends online than face-to-face and that seeing what their friends were up to via social media sites like Facebook increased their feelings of isolation. One young person who feels this way is Chloe Jackson, 19, from Norfolk, who appeared on today's This Morning to discuss the issue. She told presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford that she often feels lonely thanks to websites like Facebook. She said: 'You look at all the things your friends are doing on social media where they have checked into a pub and tagged their friends or shared pictures of themselves out having fun and you're sat at home not there. 'During my A levels I spent lot time inside revising but you still see all these people having fun without you and it's hard not to take that personally.' Ruth, 54, agreed that this contrasted with her experience growing up as 'when we were young, if you weren't invited to a party you didn't know about it.' Chloe added that people often create an online persona that doesn't reflect how they are really feeling and as a result, she often feels under pressure to do the same. She said: 'It makes you feel down all the time you are expected to be massive happy person like you are on social media, you start doubting the friends you have got. I have 1000 friends on Facebook but I don't have 1,000 friends in real life.' Chloe said Facebook often made her feel like she was left out of the fun her friends were having . This Morning's agony aunt Denise Robertson advised people to be proactive if they are feeling lonely. She suggested they join more groups, take up a new hobby or organise an event like a coffee morning in order to meet more friends. She said: 'Friendship like love does not climb in your window, if you don't go out, you won't find it.' The Big Lottery funded survey was carried out to promote 'The Big Lunch', an idea from the Eden Project encouraging people across the UK to have lunch with their neighbours on the first Sunday in June in an act of community, friendship and fun. In 2014, 4.83 million people took to their streets, gardens and community spaces for the sixth annual Big Lunch.\n"]}

Two years since he stepped down as chairman of Rangers, the crackle of gunfire still reverberates in his ears. A declaration of peace in our time is premature. Dave King, the chairman-elect, has still to obtain the SFA clearance he needs for a seat in the boardroom. Details of how the club proposes to stabilise the finances have yet to come. And the Championship promotion play-offs threaten more landmines than the Somme. Yet before participating in the annual charity golf day of the John Hartson Foundation, the Rangers icon expressed hope that the worst is over. That Rangers can put down the circus tent and become a football club once more. (Left to right): Singer Steve McCrorie joins John Hartson and Walter Smith at a charity golf match . Former Rangers chairman and manager Smith hopes that the club can move on from its off-field dramas . 'I think it's a good thing for the club that it has settled down now and the EGM is out of the way and the people can get involved with running the football club,' said Smith. 'In the last three weeks there has been a lack of headlines and that's the first step forward for Rangers. 'The whole club faces a big, big period in its history. 'They have to get back to resembling Rangers Football Club. No club wins all the time and Rangers have had down periods before, even if this one is different. 'Everyone has to adjust to it. People on the outside, fans, everyone. 'There was a lack of trust before. It was simple. Now there isn't. 'They trust the people are there for Rangers \u2014 and that's a big start after three or four years of upset.' Smith exposed himself to the crossfire when he returned \u2014 against his instincts \u2014 as chairman. It is a decision he regrets and, despite the return to the club of familiar faces such as King and Paul Murray, he is 67 now and has no need to embroil himself in the grief or stress of it all a minute longer. Asked if he would offer help or assistance to the new regime, Smith said: 'I think they are unlikely to do that. I made my part quite clear \u2014 I don't think they will ask. There is a board there in place and they will make the decisions. 'I made mine when I left and I won't go back. 'They are not liable to ask me what course of action they will take.

Rangers' teenage striker Ryan Hardie scores his first goal agianst Dumbarton in the Scottish Championship . Hardie celebrates after scoring a brace during the Scottish Championship match against Dumbarton . Smith knows King from his second spell as manager. The South African businessman was a director of the oldco before administration and liquidation and, because he served on the board during the five years prior to an insolvency event, he breaches article 10 of the SFA rulebook. He may do so on two counts. As part of his settlement with the South African tax authorities, King agreed to pay \u00a343.7million but was convicted of 41 breaches of section 75 of the SA Income Tax Act. In return for paying \u00a3210,000, he was spared 82 years in jail \u2014 two years on each count. The SFA are gathering evidence on this and until they pass judgment one way or the other, King has agreed to stay off the Rangers board. He doesn't have to be chairman or run the show to invest cash, but Smith believes it would be better if the two ran hand in hand. 'The courts seem to think he's OK,' said Smith on the issue. 'The SFA will give their own judgment on it. 'Dave has stepped in, so I don't see things changing in terms of how Rangers moves forward if he is officially or unofficially a part of it. 'It would obviously be better if he could be involved at the club \u2014 that would be better for everyone. 'I don't know all the background of what constitutes a fit-and- proper person. They have obviously got to show a bit of care with Rangers after what has gone on. I think that is what they are doing at the moment. 'I don't know what the outcome will be. I don't think it will make a massive difference to Rangers one way or the other. But the preferable aspect would be that he would be involved at the club.' Dumbarton's Garry Flemming (left) comes in with a strong challenge on Rangers' Darren McGregor (right) Rangers were never likely to be a quick fix. Promotion to the Premiership remains fraught with doubt and there are large question marks over who the manager will be next season and how much cash he may have to build a new squad. 'A few bad results and you get the sack \u2014 and someone comes in and performances are lifted,' Smith observed. 'That's what happened and it's a starting point for Rangers. 'They have to build on what they are trying to do. It's just a start and people have to remember it. 'But patience and Rangers don't really go hand in hand and never have done. There is more understanding. I won't say patience. 'That goes for all aspects of the club, on and off the pitch. It takes time to clear things off the pitch, but the pressure is always on to win regardless of off-field circumstances. 'There is an understanding of what needs to be done to take a step forward. 'Stuart McCall has been bold enough to take the job and he'll stand by his results over that period. 'It is going to take time.

Watford entered this match knowing only a victory would do in their pursuit of automatic promotion. Bournemouth, Norwich and Middlesbrough all won on Tuesday night to maintain the pace at the head of this increasingly intriguing race for Premier League gold. Aware of the circumstances, Heurelho Gomes was alert from the off. Just 56 seconds were on the clock when the Brazilian goalkeeper stopped a certain goal. Chris Burke, found by Michail Antonio, drove a shot from close range but Gomes saved with his legs. Three minutes later, the visitors went ahead. Craig Cathcart flicked on Almen Adbi\u2019s corner allowing Odion Ighalo to nod in at the far post. It was the Nigerian\u2019s 20th Championship goal in a stellar debut season. The noise from the packed away section of 1,942 gave an impression of its significance. But this was never going to be one-way traffic. Forest have beaten Bournemouth and Boro here under Dougie Freedman, as well as Norwich when Stuart Pearce was in charge, and threatened repeatedly. In the 15th minute Antonio drew a fine save from Gomes with a strike from range, then Ben Osborn hit one that required all of the Watford No 1\u2019s 6ft 3in frame to palm wide. By the end of the first half Gomes had made seven saves of varying quality.

Ighalo threaded a pass to set the Swiss international clean through but he almost had too much time to deliberate and only succeeded in poking his finish wide. The crowd let out a groan of disbelief. Abdi did better with a curling free-kick in the 34th minute but Karl Darlow was equal to it. The Forest goalkeeper did not do as well seven minutes later however, when Watford doubled their lead. Connolly strode forward from central defence and played in Ighalo, who was able to fire a shot to sting the palms of Darlow.

A Washington high school teacher is being hailed a hero for tackling a 16-year-old student to the ground after he opened fire on Monday morning. No one was injured after the boy shot twice toward the ceiling in the school commons before classes began at North Thurston High School in Lacey, about 60 miles southwest of Seattle, authorities said. Brady Olson, who teaches Advanced Placement government and civics at the school, knocked the armed student to the ground and kept him pinned down until authorities arrived, witnesses said. The shooter is in custody at the Lacey Police Station. The teenager, who has not been identified, only transferred to the high school a month ago, according to authorities. He later told police he shot into the air because he didn't want to hurt anyone. A search warrant is being carried out at his home, police said. School district spokesperson Courtney Schrieve confirmed that the 43-year-old teacher had been responsible for helping apprehend the student. 'He is a very brave man who probably saved a lot of people today,' Schrieve told KCPQ. Both students and staff said they were not surprised that Olson, who has taught at the school for nine years, was the one to stop the shooter.

A cruise ship passenger was yesterday cleared of beating up two elderly holidaymakers in a row over rudeness at the dinner table. Graeme Finlay, 53, went on trial after retired engineer Ron Phillips, 70, and his wife June, 69, were knocked unconscious in the incident outside their cabin on board the Thomson Celebration luxury liner. After being cleared Finlay, an ex-naval serviceman from Glasgow, said: 'It's been hell. It's put me off boats forever.' The frail couple accused Finlay of an unprovoked attack that left the grandfather with a gash to his forehead and his wife with two fractured vertebrae. But the 16-stone gas worker insisted he only acted in self-defence when hit by Mr Phillips wielding his crutch and denied attacking his wife. The jury at Teesside Crown Court took less than an hour to return unanimous not guilty verdicts to charges of unlawful wounding and inflicting grievous bodily harm. He told how he had put on five-stone by comfort eating since his arrest more than a year ago, and added: 'I'm really delighted with the verdicts and very, very relieved.' He said: 'It's been very stressful for the last year and a half. I go to church and I'm on the golf club committee, and it's been awful seeing my face in the news. 'I'm very sorry about everything that happened that night, I really am, but I told the truth in the court and I'm thankful that the jury believed me.'

After looking at the menu there was an 'awkward' silence and he moved to another table with a couple he had previously met. Both Finlay and the elderly couple spent the evening drinking separately and enjoying the musical entertainment. According to Finlay they later found themselves in a lift together and he rebuked the couple for their rudeness towards him at dinner. Finlay claimed Mr Phillips threw a cup of hot chocolate at him, swore and struck him with his crutch. He told the court: 'I felt myself being struck by something sharp and I put my arms over my face to defend myself, I covered my face with my arms, I didn't want my eye poked out.'

In total, six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger (part lion, part tiger) were taken from Kenny Hetrick's Stony Ridge farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit and cages were 'unsafe'. Authorities have also started cracking down on the owners of  wild creatures following an incident in 2011 where a man in eastern Ohio released 56 exotic animals - including lions and  tigers - then killed himself. Apparently Hetrick has been heartbroken by the clampdown on his farm and the 72-year-old widower is now fighting to overturn the seizure, backed by neighbors who insist his menagerie doesn't pose a threat. Scroll down for video . Feeling lost: Kenny Hetrick\u00a0is campaigning for his tigers, leopards and bears to be returned after they were seized by the state in January . They have organized car washes and handed him envelopes stuffed with thousands of dollars to pay legal bills. Some spent the winter shoring up his cages with taller fences and netting, hoping the animals will return. 'He's lost without them,' said Josh Large, who lives four houses away. 'A lot of us are lost without them.' Hetrick allowed anyone to visit at no charge, getting by with help from volunteers and donations of cash, as well as of deer and horse meat to feed his animals. He thought of himself as an educator, inviting scout troops and families to learn what they wouldn't hear at zoos. Flashback: In total six tigers, a bear, a lion, a cougar, a black leopard and a liger were taken from Hetrick's farm after it was found he did not have the correct permit - here he is seen in 2014 with his pet bear . However, the 2011 incident mentioned earlier pushed Ohio to tighten regulations on 'private zoos'. Owners are now required to have sturdy cages, background checks and insurance before receiving an annual permit. Since the beginning of last year, Ohio has issued permits to 54 exotic animal enthusiasts. Others gave up their animals or moved them out of state rather than make the changes. 'I know I didn't have everything done, but I thought they'd work with me,' said Hetrick, who acknowledged before his animals were taken that he couldn't afford everything the state wanted. The agriculture department says that it tried, but that he never responded to letters sent over a span of two years with the permit application materials until last October, nine months after the deadline, when it gave him ten days to surrender his animals. State officials in January rejected his application for a permit, which includes a $1,000 fee, saying it submitted was too late. They also said state inspectors who visited the sanctuary outside Toledo last November discovered the tigers could stand on their housing and get dangerously near the top of their cages. The inspection noted there were unsecured padlocks and chains and not enough fencing around an enclosure holding a tiger and black leopard. 'If motivated, it would be very easy for either of those two animals to escape,' said Melissa Simmerman, assistant state veterinarian. Hetrick, whose pickup truck has 'Tiger Man' painted on the side, disputes those assertions. 'Nothing's ever got loose. Not in almost 40 years,' he said. 'Nobody's ever been bit. Nobody's been hurt.' Empty: A sign affixed to a cage at Tiger Ridge Exotics in Stony Ridge, Ohio, indicates that it is the home of Cody the bear - Cody and 10 other exotic animals were seized by the state in January . Lonesome: Only Chief the wolf wasn't seized because it doesn't fall under the exotic animal law . The Ohio Department of Agriculture has a duty to protect the public's safety, spokeswoman Erica Hawkins said. 'Just because an animal's never gotten out, doesn't mean that an animal couldn't get out,' she said. Hetrick is appealing the department's rejection of his permit application and a hearing is scheduled for next week, but the fight will probably continue in court no matter what a state panel decides. Until then, the ten animals - a lion named Leo that had been in failing health was euthanized by the state last week - will remain a two-hour drive away outside Columbus, in a high-security building operated by the state. 'Today, the Ohio Department of Agriculture did the right thing by seizing the wild animals at Tiger Ridge Exotics who have been held illegally and long neglected. Now, it's been reported that the animals will possibly have to endure the stress of being tranquilized again and moved back to the roadside zoo\u2014a potentially life-threatening move. This is a selfish stunt to prevent the animals from being sent to a sanctuary where they would finally receive the care that they so desperately need. PETA is calling on the facility to do the right thing and allow these animals to enjoy a peaceful life at a reputable sanctuary where their needs would come first.' Source: Toledo News Now . Supporters of Hetrick believe the animals - only the wolf wasn't seized because it doesn't fall under the exotic animal law - have been mistreated and will not survive long outside their home. State officials insist they are fine. Hetrick doesn't have formal training with wild animals, but he has been around them about 60 years, since he was a ten-year-old volunteer cleaning cages at a zoo in Tarpon Springs, Florida. His love for wild creatures grew when he moved to Ohio. He first brought home an ocelot, often called a dwarf leopard. 'I tell people don't start with a tiger if you don't know what you're doing,' he said. He and his wife, who died four years ago, spent much of the money he made as an auto worker and police officer on the animals. Even with donations, food alone for the tigers and others cost as much as $15,000 annually in recent years. Their collection multiplied, often when others dropped off unwanted pets. His daughter, Corrina Hetrick, remembers going out to catch the school bus only to find an alligator swimming in a kiddie pool. There also was the time a black panther showed up in the back of a pickup truck. 'I didn't have cats and dogs,' she said. 'I had bears and tigers.' Even the circus camped at his two-acre property while traveling between shows. 'We had elephants in the backyard and contortionists in the living room,' she said. Erica Crawford, who has been visiting Hetrick's animals since she was a little girl and now brings her children, said she appreciates the uniqueness of the place. 'There's never been a time,' she said, 'where I felt like it's not safe there.'\n"]}
{"question_id": 362, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Nearly one in four teenagers are \u2018almost constantly\u2019 online as their lives are swallowed up ever more by their mobile phones, a study has revealed. Some 24 per cent of 13 to 17-year-olds admitted they were continuously checking their devices, including when they were at school. Nine in teenagers also confessed to going online every day as they were unable to resist the lure of Facebook and Instagram. In danger?\u00a0The study also looked at social media and found that middle class teenagers were more likely to use Snapchat, the controversial message service where messages disappears seconds after they are sent . Parents now find it increasingly difficult to monitor their children's online behaviour as more than 70 per cent of teens use now more than one social network. The study was carried out on American teenagers but the findings would likely be worse in the UK as more British teenagers own smartphones than their US counterparts. The Pew Research Centre asked 1,060 children aged between 13 and 17 about their phone habits. The report found that what Pew described as a \u00a0\u2018frenzy of access\u2019 was facilitated by mobile phones - particularly smartphones. Of the 92 per cent of teens who went online every day, more than half said that meant using their phones several times a day. Some 12 per cent admitted to using a gadget once a day, six per cent said they went online just once a week and a mere two per cent said it was less than that. Addicted:\u00a0Overall Facebook remains the most used social media site among teens with 71 per cent using it . In the largest ever systematic study of emails - examining more than 16 billion messages - researchers have found that most people send replies containing just five words. The study, which was conducted by researchers at Yahoo Labs and the University of Southern California, also found that our email habits also follow remarkable patterns. Replies become faster as the conversation progresses, but the researchers found they could tell when a email thread was about to end as the last reply was much slower than the previous replies. 'The long delay in a reply could be considered as a signal for the end of the conversation,' said the researchers, led by Farshad Kooti, a computer scientist at the University of Southern California. The study examined the emails sent by two million Yahoo users over a period of several months. They found that on average younger people tend to spend less time composing an email - with a reply time of around 13 minutes on average for teenagers. Young adults take 16 minutes, while those aged 36 to 50 years old spend around 24 minutes before sending their reply. Phone ownership was almost ubiquitous among young people, meaning they grow up used to being able to access anything any time they want. The Pew study found that nearly three-quarters of teens have access to a smartphone. Some 30 per cent have a basic phone and just 12 per cent of 13 to 17-year-olds have no phone of any kind. The study also looked at social media and found that middle class teenagers were more likely to use Snapchat, the controversial message service where the text and images disappears seconds after they are sent. The service has been blamed for a rise in \u2018sexting\u2019, where young people send explicit pictures to each other. Overall Facebook remains the most used social media site among teens with 71 per cent using it. Amanda Lenhart, the lead author and associate director of research at the Pew Research Centre, said: \u2018There\u2019s been a huge diversification of social media. \u2018If you are wondering where your child is, you probably need to cast a wide net, because there is a variety of places where your teen could be spending his or her social media time\u2019 Previous studies have starkly illustrated the extent to which young people are addicted to their mobiles. Smartphone users check their devices an average of 150 times a day as they cannot bear to be apart from them, one research paper showed. The study showed that we are so addicted to their mobiles that we cannot go 10 minutes without fiddling around with them.\n"]}

In May 2014, Benito Gonzalez Jr.,46, was suspended from duty after being arrested for allegedly exposing his genitals and touching himself inappropriately while seated at a table in a Cherry Hill Starbucks, police say. A surveillance photo posted to the Cherry Hill police Facebook page led to the 17-year Camden police veteran's arrest -- the photo has since been deleted and is now being used as evidence, the\u00a0Courier-Post\u00a0reports. Blame: Benito Gonzalez, 46 (photographed),\u00a0who pleaded guilty to a lewdness charge after allegedly masturbating in a Starbucks says his post-traumatic stress disorder is to blame . The father-of-three was found guilty of the offense last month and is currently suspended without pay, the Philadelphia Inquirer\u00a0reports . While county officials are working to fire the lieutenant's, the Post reports, Gonzalez claims the incident -- which he says he does not remember -- is the culmination of a three-year downward spiral following a traumatic experience more than three years ago, the  Inquirer\u00a0\u00a0reports. It all began in June 2011 when Gonzalez, who ran the department's narcotics unit, had an encounter with a drug dealer, 32-year-old Adam Reed. In the altercation, Gonzalez dived to the ground, injuring his hamstrings, as Reed fired shots at him from a handgun. Reed then pointed the gun at Gonzalez's head and pulled the trigger. But the weapon malfunctioned, saving Gonzalez's life, and Reed was later sentenced to 66 years in prison, the Inquirer reports. 'I just saw my life completely over,' Gonzalez told the Inquirer, 'I thought I was dead.' Gonzalez's career seemed to flourish and the 46-year-old was even promoted to lieutenant in 2013. But Gonzalez said he used his job as a way to escape his crumbling mental health. Starbucks: Police Say Gonzalez walked into this Starbucks in Cherry Hill, while off-duty, pulled down his pants and masturbated at one of the coffee-shops tables . In evaluations after the incident, psychologists recognized that Gonzalez had issues linked to the trauma and reportedly gave him the task of deciding whether to stay with the department. He chose to stay and tried hiding his problems from his co-workers telling the Inquirer that he didn't want to seem 'weak' or incapable of dong his job. In the years following the incident, Gonzalez would be diagnosed with PTSD, suffer panic attacks, experience flashbacks of the traumatic incident, and even contemplate suicide. It was not long after considering suicide that Gonzalez, while off-duty, walked into the Starbucks on Route 70 and committed the lewd act. Gonzales claims he was intoxicated and in a blackout state as a result of the trauma and only remembers drinking before going to the Starbucks and returning home that night, the Inquirer reports. He said he did not know he had been at the Starbucks until police contacted him and told him he was being charged. Gonzalez is set to appear at an administrative hearing Wednesday where his attorney will ask the department to briefly reinstate the lieutenant so he could apply for his more than $60,000 accidental-disability pension -- which law enforcement officials can receive after suffering disabilities from an incident, the Inquirer reports. The pension represents a majority of Gonzalez's income, needed to provide for his wife and three children, aged 16, 15, and 8. His wife says she fears the family will have to move from its home due to the financial strain. While the fate of Gonzalez's pension is unknown, the Post reports that a judge last month approved Gonzalez's participation in a conditional dismissal program. The program would require Gonzalez to undergo a one-year probationary period where he would be monitored. If he does not violate the probation, the lewdness charge could be dismissed, and he could have the charge expunged from his records six months later.\n"]}
{"question_id": 364, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: A British solicitor and former Mayor of Glastonbury has been revealed as a key prosecutor of the evil camp guards of Bergen-Belsen after its liberation in 1945 . Cecil Hamilton-Miller, from Kensington, London, was responsible for the convictions of 31 concentration camp guards in 1945, including several key Belsen figures, such as camp commander Josef Kramer and Dr Fritz Klein. Mr Hamilton-Miller, who died in 2001, aged 91, struggled to talk to about the horrors he witnessed during the holocaust or the role he played after the liberation of Belsen, his family has said today. Hero: Cecil Hamilton-Miller, pictured as Mayor of Glastonbury, was part of the team that prosecuted dozens of the men and women responsible for running the notorious Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp . Cecil Hamilton-Miller can be seen on the right, watching on as Bergen-Belsen camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial in 1945 . Despite his honourable actions in the wake of the liberation of Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp, which took place 70 years ago this month, many family and friends had no idea of his involvement. A historic photograph found by Mr Hamilton-Miller's family shows him watching on as camp commander Josef Kramer, known as The Beast of Belsen, is marched to his death at gunpoint following his trial. His cousin William Miller, 63, who has written a biography about the late solicitor, said: 'Cecil couldn't talk about his Belsen experience in later life without tears streaming down his face because of the traumatic memories. 'He never publicised his extraordinary war record but I am very proud of it - it must rate as the most important legal work of his career.' Prosecutor: Mr Hamilton-Miller served in India for much of World War II and arrived in Bergen-Belsen shortly after its liberation in May 1945 . Bergen-Belsen was a Nazi concentration camp in Lower Saxony, Germany. It was initially intended to hold prisoners of war, but in 1943, parts of the camp became a 'transit camp' for, mainly Jewish, civilian prisoners, . The camp became the final resting place of some 20,000 prisoners of war and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and disabled, and was is burned to the ground after its liberation by British and Canadian troops in April 1945. After qualifying as a solicitor in 1935, Cambridge educated Mr Hamilton-Miller was enlisted into the Territorial Army in 1936 and then, in 1939, was granted an emergency commission as 2nd Lieutenant in the Border Regiment. For much of the war he served in India, until in 1944 he returned to Britain on leave and was posted to Carlisle. This ended abruptly on April 15, 1945 when the 11th Armoured Division of the British Army liberated Bergen-Belsen. Recognising that the liberated camps on the continent would require military lawyers, Mr Hamilton-Miller was among those immediately posted immediately to the British Liberation Army, 49 Reinforcement Holding Unit, where he was appointed Staff Captain to 21 Army Group HQ, War Crimes Investigation Team, arriving at Belsen sometime after May 5 to a horrific, challenging and distressing scene. Mr Hamilton-Miller's role appears to have been to assist Major Savile Geoffrey Champion, head of No. 1 War Crimes Investigation Unit, Belsen, to prepare the legal cases against the SS camp personnel. Mr Miller added: 'Cecil's team opened a war crimes investigation office inside the camp and files were opened on each guard. 'Gradually written witness statements and other evidence built up in each file enabling decisions to be made as to whether and when the case against each guard was sufficiently clear and strong to progress to trial.' The first Belsen trial began on September 17, 1945, at Luneburg Town Hall and took the form of a Military Tribunal. Up in smoke: Bergen-Belsen, which became the final resting place of 20,000 POWs and 50,000 Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, Nazi opponents and people with disabilities is burned to the ground after liberation in 1945 . The trial of the prison guard, called Rothe, who killed a young girl by beating her was sentenced to ten years in prison. Mr Hamilton-Miller was also responsible for the camp commandant Kramer, the doctor, Dr Klein, and nine guards, being sentenced to death by hanging. Nineteen guards were sentenced to prison terms of between life and one year, with most of them having to serve between ten and 15 years. Mr Miller added: 'Many inmates at Belsen had been moved hurriedly from Auschwitz, and Cecil's unit took evidence from witnesses against Nazi criminals such as Dr Mengele, guards responsible for selecting people to go to the gas chambers, as well as conducting horrific medical experiments on them. 'Cecil appears to have remained in the Belsen posting until December 1945 after which he was sent home and demobbed.' Upon his return to the UK, Mr Hamilton-Miller re-qualified as a solicitor and married Sylvia Hurle. The pair lived in Glastonbury, Somerset, where Cecil lived for the majority of his life, becoming Mayor of the city in 1969. After his wife's death Cecil moved to family in Norwich before his death in 2001 aged 91.\n"]}

A British climber has cheated death on Everest for the second time in a year, it emerged last night. As rescuers faced a desperate race against time to airlift stranded climbers off the world's highest peak after the devastating earthquake on Saturday night, Selina Dicker described how she ran for her life as a wall of snow and ice tore through Base Camp. Miss Dicker, 38, from London, was at the same camp on April 18 last year when an avalanche killed 16 Sherpas who were climbing ahead of her group. The tragedy forced Miss Dicker, head of lending for finance company Europa Capital Mezzanine, to abandon her first attempt on the summit. Miss Dicker \u2013 who was in the same climbing party as Google executive Dan Fredinburg, who died in Saturday's avalanche \u2013 described the ordeal in a satellite phone call to her mother Gail Dicker at her home in Ranworth, Norfolk. Mrs Dicker, 61, said: 'She's a very lucky girl. I just want to see her home. Others in her group tried to out-run it and one of them was killed and two were seriously hurt.' Miss Dicker, who was born with a cleft palate, had been trying to raise \u00a345,000 for Operation Smile, which provides surgery for children with the condition. Her mother said: 'She wanted to go back and have another go. I tried to talk her out of it as any mother would, but she is a determined and independent woman of 38 and you cannot tell them what to do. 'I am hoping her father will talk her out of it if she wants to go back again. She listens to him more than me.' Six helicopters have been flying perilous rescue missions since the earthquake triggered a 'tsunami' of ice and rock which crushed Base Camp, killing at least 18 people and injuring dozens more. Bad weather, continued aftershocks, and poor communication have scuppered subsequent trips, leaving hundreds stranded. Climber Alex Staniforth, 19, from Chester, said on Twitter that he was 'very lucky to be alive' after being evacuated to Base Camp. But while some climbers were able to tweet and update their Facebook pages, others were cut off from communications, leaving worried families in Britain desperate for news. Up to 70 Britons are unaccounted for. Traveller Samuel Beckett, 23, from Leicester, is missing and his father Martin said: 'We have not heard anything. We just keep watching the news and keep looking through the social media sites.' Among the other stories emerging from the disaster zone were: .

Tragedy: Miss Dicker, front left, was part of the same climbing party as Google Executive Dan Fredinburg, far top right, who died in the avalanche on Saturday . CUT OFF AND PRAYING FOR A HELICOPTER . Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain: 'All Alex keeps talking about is her need for a glass of wine. Some of us are more chilled out than others.' As the adventurous couple, both 28, spent a third night halfway up Everest, Alex's sister Liz Schneider, 23, said: 'The ordeal isn't over. They have not been able to get off yet. 'We are just keeping our fingers crossed and hoping they can get to safety soon.' Awaiting rescue yesterday, newlyweds Sam and Alex Chappatte were in good spirits as they tweeted from the mountain . Video has emerged of the moment the earthquake hit Mount Everest and triggered a massive avalanche . The Chappattes, who married two weeks ago in Chelsea, London, tweeted earlier yesterday: 'Trying to get a chopper.' They then wrote 'fog creeping up the valley'. The newlyweds have described how they saw an 'avalanche coming straight at us' and were blown over by a blast of wind. They scrambled to shelter behind other tents and had to keep making air holes in the snow to breathe as the avalanche engulfed them. DESPERATE SOS FROM MISSING TREKKER . The family of a missing British woman has received an SOS message saying her group is trapped without food and water and in desperate need of medical assistance. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Friday. One of her fellow walkers \u2013 from South Africa \u2013 managed to send a message to his mother saying the group needed help. Yoga student Susannah Ross, 20, has not been in contact since she left for a trek in the remote valleys in the Langtang National Park on Frida . Susannah's sister Nina, 25, from Bath, Somerset, said: 'Someone has managed to text or something saying they are stuck in an area with 15 other trekkers. They have sent the co-ordinates but said in the message that some are injured and that they don't have any food or water and that they really need to be rescued. They have said they need a helicopter to get out. 'All the roads around them are ruined and they can't get out. We are frantically trying to work out a way of reaching her and getting her help.' THE PHONE CALLS...AND THE GRIM SILENCE . Gap-year volunteer Anna Buchanan, 18, from New Malden, was missing for more than 24 hours until she contacted her distraught mother Pauline, who said: 'As I spoke to her there was another tremor. Everyone started screaming, it was just awful.' Saad Hikmet, from Mill Hill, whose son Jonathan, 25, has not been heard of since the disaster, said: 'He was on a trek of Northern Nepal with yoga instructors and they've been going around for a month. Now we just want to know that he's safe.' Philip Green, 30, originally from St John's Wood, London, was still missing yesterday. His brother Rob said: 'Obviously we are extremely worried at the moment. It's a nightmare for us.' Barbara and Ian Nightingale, who are from Nottingham and in their 60s, were believed to be trekking in Nepal at the time of the quake. A couple from Carshalton in south London \u2013 Chloe Pincho and Brennan White \u2013 were trekking up Everest at the time of the disaster, but last night made contact.

{"question_id": 367, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Watching George Osborne enjoy scampi and chips with a glass of cider and a chat with the locals in a Somerset pub garden, it is hard to believe that only three years ago he was virtually scared to leave the safety of his Treasury office. He felt besieged and intimidated. There was little evidence his hardline \u2018austerity Britain\u2019 policies were working. His nervy demeanour and pallid complexion reflected the sickly economy. In the eyes of critics he was a hate figure \u2013 and it was getting to him. \u2018It\u2019s fair to say that by 2012 it was tough economically, and I got myself into a position where I was hunkered down in the Treasury,\u2019 George Osborne drinks a pint of Somerset cider as he is interviewed by Political Editor Simon Walters at The Cotley Inn, near Chard, Somerset . Osborne reflects as we chat at the Cotley Inn in Chard during a break in an Election campaign tour of the South West. \u2018I was saying, look, if people don\u2019t like the plan or whatever, well, you know\u2026 so be it.\u2019 The nadir came when the Chancellor was booed at the Paralympic Games. Worse, it happened in front of his children, Luke and Liberty, now aged 13 and 11. Did he feel he couldn\u2019t take any more? \u2018I never personally felt, erm, low,\u2019 he says slowly, giving a rare glimpse of his emotions. \u2018But I\u2019m not going to pretend it was easy. \u2018The most difficult thing was explaining it to my children \u2013 it\u2019s not an easy conversation to have.\u2019 Osborne has gone from being booed in front of his two children at the Paralympics to being credited with helping to turn Britain's economy around . Osborne did not consider throwing in the towel, but he knew that he had to break out of his Treasury bunker. \u2018I thought, hold on, you cannot do this in this job \u2013 you have to go out and explain yourself, meet people, expose yourself to fresh ideas.\u2019 He gestures with outstretched arms, hands clenched, recalling the moment he got a grip. Since then, confidence in the economy has risen on the same slow but steady path as that of the Chancellor himself. And he did more than look at himself in the mirror politically. He went on the 5:2 diet and lost 2st. On the day of our interview, a national newspaper compared the new-look Osborne to dashing Latin heart-throb actor Antonio Banderas \u2013 quite a change from the days when he was derided as a Regency fop. \u2018It\u2019s definitely moving in the right direction!\u2019 he laughs. More waspish and engaging than David Cameron in private, Osborne has always looked more awkward and unsympathetic in public. It is one of the reasons he stood aside when Cameron ran for the Tory Party leadership. He is not the type to emote in public at the drop of a hat \u2013 a basic skill required by modern leaders. His sense of isolation in his early days as Chancellor was compounded by being separated from his family as a result of his and wife Frances\u2019s decision in 2010 to carry on living in their family home in London instead of moving to Downing Street. They thought it would make it easier to preserve a \u2018normal\u2019 family life.\u00a0It did the opposite. \u2018I never saw the kids or Frances, because I was up so early and back late,\u2019 Osborne says. His morale improved dramatically when the family did move into Downing Street, one of the few U-turns Osborne has made. \u2018I see the children all the time now, in the morning, and I can pop up in the early afternoon if I\u2019m going out in the evening,\u2019 he says cheerily. \u2018I feel very lucky.\u2019 Osborne also had some stark warnings for the voting public - saying Britain under Labour will mimic France's course since it voted in socialist Francois Hollande as president . Osborne\u2019s tour of the West Country has been designed to target seats where the Tories are fighting the Lib Dems. At Hawkins Garage in St Austell, Cornwall, to promote the Government\u2019s apprenticeship scheme, the Chancellor was shown by 17-year-old trainee mechanic Dale Wilkes how to drain a car sump. Osborne\u2019s hand ended up drenched in oil. If he had been asked to do it in his \u2018hunkered down\u2019 phase he would have found it torture. Here, with his skinny frame in blue garage overalls, it wasn\u2019t easy to tell him apart from the apprentices in the gloom beneath the car ramp as Dale passed him a spanner. From St Austell it was back to\u00a0Somerset and Yeovil, where Osborne hopes the Tory candidate will unseat Lib Dem David Laws who was, until two weeks ago, a Coalition colleague. Osborne was such a fan of Laws that when the Coalition was formed in 2010, he made Laws his deputy, stating that he was \u2018put on earth to be Treasury Chief Secretary\u2019. \u2018Well, he didn\u2019t last long in that position!\u2019 hoots Osborne with a fiendish grin. Laws was forced to resign after he was caught up in an MPs\u2019 expenses scandal which led to him being painfully \u2018outed\u2019 as gay. Osborne\u2019s ruthless political approach allows no room for sentiment. Danny Alexander, the Lib Dem who succeeded Laws as Osborne\u2019s Treasury deputy, claimed that an unnamed \u2018very senior Tory\u2019 told him: \u2018You take care of the workers, we\u2019ll take care of the bosses.\u2019 Was it Osborne who said it, as many suspected? \u2018No,\u2019 the Chancellor snaps. But if he has rescued the economy and Ed Miliband and Ed Balls are so useless, as he always claims, why aren\u2019t the Conservatives ahead in the polls? Is it time to press the panic button? \u2018The campaign is going as we wanted it to,\u2019 he insists. Really? \u2018Yes. We always thought it would be close.\u2019 Mr Osborne said he never 'personally felt low' about being booed at the Paralympics in 2012, but had to explain it to his children . But Miliband is proving more resilient than the Tories expected. \u2018Only because he\u2019s standing behind podiums in front of Labour supporters,\u2019 he mocks. Tory MPs claim that their party\u2019s campaign lacks passion and that Cameron\u2019s Australian election guru, Lynton Crosby, is too aggressive and too powerful. Osborne stands foursquare behind them: \u2018David Cameron leads this Election campaign from the front.\u2019 It provokes him into showing some passion of his own. \u2018I\u2019m not about to hand over the keys to No 11 to Ed Balls, saying, \u201cGo and wreck all the good work we\u2019ve done and ruin the lives of the people of this country.\u201d Absolutely not!\u2019 The one U-turn Osborne has made during the last five years is moving his wife Frances (pictured) and their children to No 11 Downing Street, so he can be closer to them . He says that if Labour wins, Britain will become an economic basket case like France did after socialist Francois Hollande won power. \u2018France is an example of how quickly the mood can turn sour, jobs go, debts pile up. People will say, \u201cMy God, Britain is going backward instead of forward.\u201d Osborne is in his stride now, spitting venom. \u2018All this sanctimonious rubbish you hear from Labour about standing up for\u00a0the many not the few\u2026 the people who suffer most when Labour governments screw up the economy are the poorest.\u2019 A measure of the transformation in his standing was indicated when last month Cameron named Osborne as one of three potential successors \u2013 and no one laughed. So would he like to become PM? \u2018I\u2019m not a politician who spends my life thinking, \u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d and \u201cWhat when\u2026?\u201d \u2019 Rot, he can be every bit as calculating as Labour\u2019s Machiavellian Peter Mandelson, we tease him. \u2018I\u2019m not rising to that!\u2019 he laughs. Osborne was back on the campaign trail yesterday in his Tatton constituency, combining politics with a family day out. He was accompanied by Frances, a successful author and daughter of former Tory Minister Lord David Howell, and Luke and Liberty. \u2018We\u2019re all really looking forward to the Election. The children are interested in it. My son went through the newspaper the other day and marked up what he thought were good stories for me and bad ones,\u2019 he chuckles. \u2018Then The Voice came on TV and we switched over to that.\u2019 With that, Osborne takes another sip of his Somerset cider, aptly called Thatchers Gold. It slakes Osborne\u2019s thirst for now. But he will be left with a permanent bitter taste if the Tories don\u2019t win Election gold on May 7.\n"]}

The product, Phynova Joint and Muscle Relief, contains sigesbeckia, a herb traditionally used to treat aches and pains caused by arthritis. 'Until now many GPs have been wary of recommending Chinese herbs, but now there is one product that we know is produced safely and at the optimum dose,' explains Professor George Lewith, a complementary medicine researcher from Southampton University. Sigesbeckia is a herb traditionally used to treat aches and pains caused by arthritis . 'Sigesbeckia gives us another alternative to anti-inflammatory drugs which come with potential side-effects such as gastrointestinal bleeding.' Professor Lewith doesn't use the product himself, but says that before having hip replacements for arthritis he used another herb, Devil's Claw, as a remedy for joint pain. He isn't the only orthodox doctor who recommends complementary therapies to his patients... HERBAL MEDICINE FOR COLDS AND DEPRESSION . Dr Mike Dixon, a GP in Cullompton, Devon, and chairman of the College of Medicine, says he is a 'fan' of herbal medicines because they are 'safe, help to encourage self-care by patients and, in cases such as mint and aloe vera, can be grown by the patients themselves, making them virtually free'. 'My go-to remedy in the cold season is a herb called pelargonium, which I take as soon as I feel a cold coming as it prevents the virus replicating,' he says. 'I also use mint tea for indigestion and make a remedy from the lemon balm that grows in my garden to help me sleep. You just put five leaves in a cup of boiling water and leave it to brew. The remedy I most commonly suggest to patients, though, is St John's wort. There is strong evidence that it helps in tackling mild to moderate depression. It is also a potential treatment for long-term tiredness. 'It can interfere with the contraceptive Pill and some other medications - but it's definitely something that I suggest patients should consider.' Before taking St John's wort, check with your pharmacist or GP. Dr Mike Dixon says he is a 'fan' of herbal medicines because they are 'safe' (posed by model) HYPNOTHERAPY FOR BOWEL TROUBLE . Professor Peter Whorwell, a gastroenterologist at the Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester, specialises in helping people with severe Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). 'By the time they come to me most other treatments have failed, and I recommend hypnotherapy to probably 70 to 80 per cent of them as part of a treatment package including medication, diet and lifestyle changes. 'It works on about 80 per cent of those who try it. IBS involves abnormal muscle spasms of the gut and hypersensitivity of the gut to pain, and is aggravated by stress. Hypnotherapy tackles all three of these causes. 'I have been taught self-hypnosis to help me sleep when my mind is whirring. I think it's a skill every doctor should learn.' TURMERIC FOR ACHES AND PAINS . Dr Uzma Ali, an NHS GP who also works at the Integrated Medical Centre in London, explains that as a child she was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over. Dr Uzma Ali was always given a glass of warm milk with half a teaspoon of the spice turmeric if she fell over . 'Only now do I know why that was - turmeric contains an ingredient called curcumin which has been found to have a powerful anti-inflammatory action. 'Now, if I see patients with problems like sports injuries, back pain, whiplash, fibromyalgia or sciatica, I suggest that they add a supplement of curcumin to their treatment - or, if they can't take painkillers, that they use it as their primary remedy. 'My favourite remedy is called Dehlvi's Haldi capsules, which contain turmeric, but you can buy turmeric/curcumin capsules in health stores - or just add more to your cooking.' ACUPUNCTURE FOR MIGRAINES . Dr Tanvir Jamil, a GP at Burnham Health Centre, near Slough in Berkshire, has been treating his patients with acupuncture for years. 'I mostly offer this to patients for pain relief - particularly migraine. If medication or lifestyle changes such as reducing stress aren't working, acupuncture will often help. I normally give patients one session a week for four weeks. The number\u00a0of GPs in Britain\u00a0who practise homeopathy . 'I combine Chinese acupuncture - which works along energy lines called meridians in the body, that Chinese practitioners believe become imbalanced during illness - and Western acupuncture, which concentrates the needles where it specifically hurts. 'So for migraine, I'd use the needles around the face, either side of the eyebrow, the cheek and just under the ear - along with points in the hands. 'I decided to learn acupuncture when I was a junior doctor over 20 years ago. The evidence is good enough that the government health watchdog, NICE, recommends acupuncture on the NHS for migraines. 'I have had acupuncture myself for neck pain in the past. Exactly how it works isn't known but my personal theory is that it somehow stops the nerves being as sensitive to pain signals. 'It's a once-a-week treatment and there are no side-effects - it could save the NHS a fortune if it was used more widely.' YOGA FOR SKIN COMPLAINTS . Every morning Dr Stefanie Williams, a dermatologist and medical director of European Dermatology London, does ten to 15 minutes of yoga and 20 minutes' meditation at lunchtime. 'Both help my stress levels and also benefit my skin,' she says. 'The stress hormone cortisol raises levels of inflammation in the skin - and this not only triggers faster ageing but aggravates conditions such as acne, eczema and rosacea. The stress hormone cortisol raises levels of inflammation in the skin - yoga can alleviate this . 'For this reason I also advise my patients, whether they are coming to me for skin problems or merely for cosmetic procedures, to try yoga or meditation as part of their treatment plan. 'They are often surprised by the idea, but many have experienced their skin flaring up when they are stressed, so once I explain the science behind why that happens they are very keen to include it.' HOMEOPATHY FOR INDIGESTION . Most conventional doctors are highly sceptical of homeopathy, questioning the idea that minute amounts of a substance that triggers symptoms can also be used to treat those symptoms. Not so Dr Tim Robinson, a GP in Beaminster, Dorset, who has been a GP for 25 years and a homeopath for 20. 'I use homeopathy myself - most commonly Nux Vom, which I take when I get indigestion - and I do suggest the remedies to some of my patients. 'It is helpful when conventional medication has nothing to offer, or where it's contra-indicated. 'For example, if I have a menopausal woman coming to see me with hot flushes and she can't take HRT because she has had breast cancer, or has been using HRT for the recommended two to four years and must come off it, there are a few homeopathic remedies I can suggest - belladonna being the most common. 'Homeopathy is also useful for chilblains - there are topical orthodox treatments for this but they aren't very effective. 'The idea behind homeopathy is that dilute forms of substances that cause the symptoms of a condition can also help to treat it. 'In a study of 20,000 people by Bristol Homeopathic Hospital, 70 per cent of them said they felt a positive benefit.'\n"]}

Prince George's brother or sister could be called Sam - after the jockey that helped the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge rekindle their romance. Bookmakers have slashed odds on the name Sam - which could be used for Samuel or Samantha - being chosen for the name of the second royal baby. It follows the success of part-time jockey and the Duchess of Cambridge's close friend Sam Waley-Cohen at Aintree this weekend. The 33-year-old amateur jockey was once dubbed 'The Royal Matchmaker' after he helped the couple rekindle their romance during their brief split in 2007. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have publicly insisted that even they do not know what sex their second child will be. Ladbrokes confirmed they received a recent flurry of bets following Mr Waley Cohen's high-profile win on Radjhani Express on Friday in Aintree's Crabbies Topham Chase - prompting their odds to tumble from 66/1 to 20/1. David Williams of Ladbrokes said: 'With Sam Waley-Cohen's close links to the Royals it seems punters are putting two and two together and coming up with Sam as their answer for the baby's name.' Simon Clare, from bookmakers Coral, confirmed they too have had no choice but reduce their odds on 'Sam' in recent days because of the popularity of the name. He explained: 'We have slashed his odds from 66/1 to 40/1 . 'Given how close the Duchess of Cambridge is to Sam Waley-Cohen we are also seeing money for Sam or Samuel at 150/1 and Samantha at 200/1 to be their second baby's name.' Scroll down for video . The new prince or princess will be fourth in line to the throne but, unlike Prince George, he or she is not expected to rule as sovereign. The baby will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. Alice is still the favourite at 3/1 followed closely by Elizabeth and Charlotte at 5/1 and 6/1 respectively, according to Ladbrokes on Sunday afternoon. At the moment odds have been slashed for female names, because of widespread speculation that the Duchess of Cambridge will give birth to a sister for Prince George.

Mr Waley-Cohen, a part-time jump-jockey and healthcare businessman, won the Cheltenham Gold Cup in 2010 on 'Long Run' The royal baby is expected to arrive later this month. There is speculation the Cambridges' second born might arrive on the Queen's birthday on April 21 or even the Duke and Duchess' fourth wedding anniversary on April 29. Other reports suggest the due date could be April 25. The Duchess of Cambridge is to return to the Lindo wing at St Mary's Hospital in London to give birth. as she did with Prince George (pictured) That date would tally with the fact that the Duchess' final public engagements before she gives birth were carried out on March 27 in South London, suggesting late April is more likely than mid-April. The Duchess' second pregnancy was announced on September 8 when she was thought to be just six weeks pregnant. She has been staying at the couple's new country home in Norfolk, Anmer Hall. But she is expected to return to London soon as she intends to give birth at the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital, where a natural birth costs up to \u00a310,000.

The older brother of comedienne Mindy Kaling has controversially claimed he was only accepted into medical school in the late 1990s because he posed as a black man. Writing on his blog, Almost Black, Vijay Chokal-Ingam says that he felt he had to change his appearance to get into the St. Louis University School of Medicine and heavily attacks affirmative action policies in the United States. 'I was determined to become a doctor and I knew that admission standards for certain minorities under affirmative action were, let's say\u2026 less stringent?' wrote Chokal-Ingam. 'I got into medical school because I said I was black. The funny thing is I'm not.' Chokal-Ingam admits that his sister did not support him during his social experiment and specifically asked him not to do it. He claims in 1998 he shaved his head, trimmed his 'long Indian eyelashes' and joined the Organization of Black Students during the process. His change in appearance was 'so startling that my own fraternity brothers didn't recognize me'. 'Vijay the Indian-American frat boy became Jojo the African American Affirmative Action applicant to medical school,' he said, claiming that Jojo was the middle name he was born with. Though his website, AlmostBlack.com, shows side-by-side qualifications and pictures of Chokal-Ingam as an Indian-American man (left) and a black man (right), he doesn't specify if he went through the same application process as an Inidan-American man as he did a black man . As an Indian-American with a GPA of 3.1, MCAT of 31 and a member of the South Asian Student Association, he didn't think he'd get into medical school, but with a change of appearance and switch of student organization, he thought he could get in to some of the top schools in the nation. 'I became a serious contender at some of the greatest medical schools in America, including Harvard, Wash U, UPenn, Case Western, and Columbia,' he said about the application process. 'In all, I interviewed at eleven prestigious medical schools in 9 major cities across America, while posing a black man,' he added. Despite his startling claims, Chokal-Ingam fails to mention if he applied to the same schools at the same time as an Indian-American man. He also does not seem to appear repentant about presumably taking a place at college that would otherwise have gone to an African-American. When he was finally accepted to St. Louis University School of Medicine, he used the acceptance to claim he was only granted admission because he was black and used the situation as an example of what was 'wrong' with affirmative action. Chokal-Ingam said that his sister, sitcom star and comedienne Mindy Kaling told him not to move forward with the book . Indeed, Chokal-Ingam admits that he did not even complete his medical degree and dropped out before he qualified as a doctor. Chokal-Ingam also admits he found posing as a black person to be socially fascinating. 'Not everything worked out as planned,' he wrote on his website. 'Cops harassed me. Store clerks accused me of shoplifting. Women were either scared of me or couldn't keep their hands off me. What started as a devious ploy to gain admission to medical school turned into a twisted social experiment.' Unsurprisingly, Chokal-Ingam has been at the end of a huge backlash following his contentious claims. The Daily Beast claims that though his experience 'revealed inherent cultural bigotries that feed systematic racism', he didn't bring everything he could to the table. 'He chooses to sidestep, downplay, or flat-out ignore how the same racism that led to him being harassed by cops and store clerks keeps black applicants on the fringes of elite educational institutions for generations,' Stereo Williams wrote. 'It's easier for him to tap dance for the right wing as the brown man who 'gets it', while conveniently missing how ongoing racism makes affirmative action absolutely necessary,' he added. And though he claims he became a serious contender at schools across the nation as a black man, he doesn't specify if he went through the application process as an American-Indian man. 'Chokal-Ingam seems to have assumed that he would've gotten nowhere as an Indian American applicant and dove head first into this poorly-conceived 'experiment' before determining otherwise,' Williams wrote. And more so, Williams claims that Chokal-Ingam's experiment 'is insulting to what black people endure in this country, both institutionally and culturally'. Williams claims: 'And as a person of color, it's irresponsible for him to be so invested in the idea of individual exceptionalism that he ignores structural inadequacies. 'Black people can't be as 'racist' as whites societally, Mr. Chokal-Ingam. You didn't spend your time applying to black colleges in the hopes of finding work as a doctor in black-owned and operated hospitals. 'And a major reason why you were in a position to be considered for entry into any white institution is because black people generations before you made that possible through sacrifice and hard work. 'The attempt to undermine their work for the sake of promoting false 'equality' is truly regrettable. But when you conduct social 'experiments' that cite C. Thomas Howell's Soul Man as an inspiration, it's obvious that you don't take these issues all that seriously.' A spokesperson for Mindy Kaling was unavailable for comment.\n"]}

After he failed to turn up for his flight back home, Mr Carn's worried family contacted the Foreign Office in a bid to track him down. They said his disappearance was completely out of character and feared he would miss the first birthday of his twins Freddie and Stanley. But the phoneless 29-year-old today handed himself into the British Consulate - having walked for two days to try and get back to Barcelona. According to his family, Mr Carn, who runs his own building company, was dropped 'miles away' from his accommodation by the Spanish driver when he tried to get back to his hotel on Saturday night. He then set off to try and find his friends - and only arrived at the British Consulate this afternoon. Speaking after he was found, Anna Harvey, the sister of Mr Carn's 31-year-old partner Emma, said the family was 'ecstatic' that he was safe. She said: 'He got into a taxi and the driver took him miles away from where he was staying. 'When he said at the end of the journey this was not his accommodation he was chucked out of the cab and has spent the last two days walking back to Barcelona. He has just walked in to the British Consulate to say he was stranded.' She added that the family were not yet sure where he had been stranded but that it was 'miles' away from where he was staying. She said: 'He has been walking for about 20 hours. The message we had from him was quite garbled so at the moment we are not sure exactly where he was dumped, but it appears it was a very long way from where he should have been. 'He was stranded with no phone or money. My sister is so relieved and the family are ecstatic. None of us thought we would ever see him again. The father-of-four, pictured left and right with partner Emma Harvey, had last been seen by friends on Saturday night and failed to turn up for his flight back home from the Spanish city . Family and friends became concerned after not hearing from Mr Carn for more than 48 hours. They contacted the Foreign Office amid fears that he would miss the first birthday of his twins Stanley and Freddie (pictured) 'His friends are buying him a flight home tonight so he can be back in time for his twins boys' first birthday tomorrow.' Ms Harvey had previously told how two of the stag party group had stayed behind to help with the search for Mr Carn. They had last seen him in Flaherty's bar on Saturday night. She told how friends became worried when he did not make it back to the group's hotel and missed his flight home. She added that it is his sons' first birthday tomorrow, something which he would 'never miss'. Mr Carn handed himself into the British Consulate this afternoon, after walking for 20 hours to find safety. He is now being bought a flight home by friends so he can celebrate the twins' birthday tomorrow . She had said: 'He is not one to normally not get in contact. Emma last spoke to him when they had arrived on Friday night. 'He had planned to take the family to Paignton zoo for the twin's birthday and it was something they had been really looking forward to. 'We had joked about him missing his flight with that in mind - as we knew he never would.' In addition to the twins Freddie and Stanley, Mark has two step-children with Emma: Ava, 11, and Gwen, seven.\n"]}

The Labour leader's 'Stalinist' plan to seize unused plots \u2013 as well as impose rent controls \u2013 shocked experts and investors. Property analysts said the move would take Britain back to the 'dark days of the Seventies'. Scroll down for video . Land-Grabber: Red Ed wants councils to encourage building by raising tax on unused land . Mr Miliband wants to bring in 'use it or lose it' powers allowing councils to encourage building by putting up taxes on undeveloped land. Sites still left idle could be compulsorily purchased for use by another developer. The announcement saw shares in housebuilders, including Barratt Developments, Persimmon and Taylor Wimpey, fall by around 2 per cent before later recovering. The Institute of Directors describes the land grab as a 'Stalinist attack on property rights'. Last night a spokesman said: 'Developers do not generally sit on large amounts of land for long periods. Talking about compulsory purchasing is very difficult \u2013 who makes the decisions? 'We don't think that a series of interventions on the demand side of the housing market are particularly helpful when the problem is we are not building enough houses.' Pointing the way:\u00a0Mr Miliband wants to bring in 'use it or lose it' powers for councils . Andrew Percy, Tory candidate for Brigg and Goole, said: 'It is the sort of policy you might expect from Soviet Russia. 'We should encourage developers to use this land, but threatening to steal people's land is using a stick rather than a carrot.' Mr Miliband's plan to link rents to inflation\u00a0under new, three-year contracts came under fire too. Alan Ward, of the Residential Landlords Association, said Margaret Thatcher's abolition of rent controls in 1988 had doubled the number of homes on the lettings market. 'Labour's plans would take use back to the dark days of the Seventies and the Eighties which caused a shortage of decent homes to rent,' he added. Melanie Leech, chief executive of the British Property Federation, said: 'In places like London tenants will find this policy on rents may make their budgeting harder, rather than easier. 'Their rent will tick along at CPI inflation for a couple of years and then they will face a potential sharp rise in year three when the rent returns to market. 'Ultimately what will help tenants best is more investment in housing. 'Pension funds and other institutions have billions to invest in this market \u2013 developing places that would provide a new generation of high-quality homes that offer greater choice to renters, including the option to sign longer tenancies.' In it together:\u00a0Mr Miliband said the pledge to cut stamp duty to zero over the next three years would benefit nine out of ten people buying their first home . Richard Lambert, of the National Landlords Association, said Labour's package would make owners less likely to risk their money in providing homes while banks would be deterred from advancing loans. In his policy package, Mr Miliband also said he wanted to 'restore the dream of home ownership' by giving first-time buyers a stamp duty holiday on homes up to \u00a3300,000 in value. He said up to half of new homes would be earmarked for local residents trying to get a foot on the property ladder, while higher taxes would be imposed on foreign buyers. Mr Miliband's housing announcements are an attempt to regain the initiative after the Tories unveiled a popular policy two weeks ago to extend the right to buy to all tenants of housing associations. The Labour leader said housing would be a late addition on his party's election pledge card \u2013 increasing the number of pledges from five to six. Mr Miliband said the pledge to cut stamp duty to zero over the next three years would benefit nine out of ten people buying their first home, could save up to \u00a35,000 and would cost the Government \u00a3225million a year. Chancellor George Osborne dismissed Mr Miliband's stamp duty pledge as a 'complete gimmick'. Naomi Heaton, of London Central Portfolio, an asset management company, said Mr Miliband's housing policy was 'a load of old cobblers'. 'Labour are clearly very bad at their sums, which is why, of course, we are so worried about them running the economy,' she said. 'The average purchase price for a first time buyer outside London is \u00a3137,120, according to the Halifax. Following the new stamp duty reforms introduced by the Conservative coalition last December, the stamp duty charge for buyers at this level is just \u00a3242. 'This is what the Labour policy would save \u2013 not \u00a35,000.' Jenny Luckitt, of campaign group Generation Rent, said: 'These policies to cut stamp duty do nothing for affordability. 'They merely stimulate demand and drive house prices even further out of reach of ordinary first-time buyers. 'Limiting this policy to the first two years of government is a gimmick that will only drive up prices as people scramble to buy before the 'holiday' is over.' Trump card:\u00a0The Labour leader said housing would be a late addition on his party's election pledge card \u2013 increasing the number of pledges from five to six . David Orr, of the National Housing Federation, said: 'Slashing stamp duty could lead to even higher demand on homes for first-time buyers, pushing up prices even further out of reach, while not addressing the supply of homes we so desperately need.' Mr Miliband dismissed the backlash, saying: 'Our proposals will be better for home owners in Britain and for companies building homes in Britain. 'We have a housing market that is frankly not working and we have government that is not unblocking the real barriers there are in the housing market.' Mr Miliband added: 'We won't let those large developers just hoard land \u2013 waiting for it to go up in value when it could be used to build homes. 'We'll say: Either you use the land or you lose the land.'\n"]}

'I hit the ground running ... the first I ever wrestled was at Wrestlemania with an attendance record at Levi's Stadium,' she told Piper, whose nickname Rowdy she took for herself with his blessing. 'I had a problem when I left though. There's no way I can't not go back in there again. There's no way. After experiencing that, there's nothing like it. Yeah. 'The second I left I was already thinking, 'How can I possibly go back?' I didn't even change yet. I hadn't even gotten out of my outfit yet.' Rousey tweeted 'We're just gettin' started' after the event fuelling speculation for a return however her agent Brad Slater told Fox Sports' UFC Tonight that it was just a one-off. Rousey throws Triple H over her shoulder and into the canvas as The Rock watches on in the hit appearance . Speaking to Piper about the differences between WWE and UFC, Rousey said it was about the 'uncertainty of the fight'. 'I don't know exactly what's going to happen,' she said of UFC, even though a predicted early attack in her last fight out led to her ending Cat Zingano's night after a record 14 seconds. 'I don't know if I'm going to get really hurt,' she continues. 'I don't know what they're going to come out with. My mind is still running over a million things that could possibly happen, whereas when I know exactly what's going to go down (in WWE), roughly, because it didn't go down exactly as I thought. Give or take. I'm like, 'OK, this is the way it's going to be and if it's going to be this way I'm not going to screw it up.' 'Whereas in a fight, I'm like, 'Don't get stuck in a certain way. It can go any way so don't screw it up.' It's a different kind of anxiety, for sure.' From dangerous to demure, Rousey poses in front of a fast car at the premiere of Fast & Furious 7 . Rousey flies in for a punch on Michelle Rodriguez in their highly acclaimed Fast & Furious fight scene . After some high-profile movie roles, including the blockbuster Fast and Furious release that includes an epic fight scene with Michelle Rodriguez, and the completion of her book My Fight, Your Fight (out in May), Rousey's focus returns to her day job as the headline bout for UFC 190. Her UFC bantamweight title will be up for grabs at the HSBC Arena against Correia, who is also undefeated in the Octagon and has been campaigning for a title shot with taunts at the expense of Rousey's 'Four Horsewomen' friends. 'This fight is not going to be short,' Rousey told Piper. 'I don't want her walking out of there the same way she she when she walked in.'\n"]}

Some members of the terrorist cell had direct contact with al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden before his death in Pakistan in 2011, wiretaps showed, Italy's state-run ANSA news agency reported. And wiretaps and other intelligence revealed that the group planned to carry out terrorist attacks in Afghanistan and Pakistan as well as in Italy, according to Caligari Chief Prosecutor Mauro Mura. Some evidence indicated the Vatican was among the targets considered, police said. Talk of this took place March 2010, around the time a possible suicide bomber from Afghanistan entered Italy, Mura said. Police said, too, that some of the suspects were involved in a Pakistani market bombing in 2009 in which more than 300 people were killed and injured . The suspects had been under surveillance for years, some as far back as 2005, police said. On Friday, Italian State Police closed in, carrying out raids in seven provinces in what they called a first-of-its-kind operation. One of the raids targeted the alleged terrorist cell's headquarters on the island of Sardinia. The operation, which is still going on, is expected to result in the arrest of 18 people, most of them from Pakistan, said spokesman Paolo Meloni, who represents the police in Sassari, Sardinia, where the investigation is being coordinated. Some suspects had an abundance of weapons and moved cash around the world, police said. One was apprehended on a flight from Italy to Pakistan while carrying 55,000 euros, or nearly $60,000, police said. Meloni said the provinces in which the raids were being carried out included Frosinone and Macerata, which are in central Italy, as well as Bergamo, in the north. Some of those expected to be arrested are suspected of having been involved in the 2009 car bombing in Pakistan, Meloni said. In that bombing, in a bazaar in the northwestern Pakistani city of Peshawar, 137 people were killed and more than 200 were injured. Still other suspects are suspected of involvement in migrant trafficking, he said. Police said the group tried to recruit to its cause the migrants it transported.

The 25-year-old died in police custody 15 days ago after he was arrested on a weapons charge. His death from a severe spinal chord injury sparked widespread outrage toward the Baltimore Police Department. Gray's death in custody is the latest in a string of high profile deaths involving African-Americans and law enforcement. Many have demanded answers about what happened to Gray and his funeral drew civil rights leaders, politicians, and relatives of others who died in police custody. Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings of Maryland spoke at the funeral: \"To mother Gloria and to the entire family, I want you to know we stand with you during this difficult time.\" Cummings said he \"looked at the cameras\" and reflected on the great amount of attention Gray was receiving in death: \"Did anybody recognize Freddie Gray when he was alive?\" he asked. Cummings said that Gray joined the church in 2001. He was in youth choir and was a junior usher. \"He loved church,\" Cummings said. Gray also played football. \"Did you see him?\" the representative asked. \"There are those who will tell you don't cry. I'm not going to say that,\" Cummings said. Gray also had a history of run-ins with the law. According to court documents CNN obtained, there were more than 20 criminal court cases in Maryland against Gray, and five of those cases were still active at the time of his death. The cases involve mostly drug-related charges, but there are charges from March for second-degree assault and destruction of property. Gray was due in court on a possession charge on April 24. He had been in and out of prison since 2009 for various drug cases, according to the Maryland Department of Corrections. Families United for Justice was also at the funeral. The group includes relatives of Eric Garner, who died last July after a New York City police officer put him in a chokehold. Protests erupted after a grand jury declined to indict that officer. Other members of the group include relatives of Amadou Diallo, who was fatally shot by New York police officers, and Alberta Spruill, who died of a heart attack after police threw a stun grenade into her apartment during a botched raid. The White House sent Cabinet Secretary Broderick Johnson, chair of the Obama administration's My Brother's Keeper Task Force; Heather Foster, an adviser in the White House Office of Public Engagement; and Elias Alcantara from the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs. Exactly what happened to Gray remains a mystery. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. News of Gray's smashed upper spine and the delay in getting him medical care has triggered outrage across the country. Hundreds of protesters peacefully rallied on the streets of Baltimore on Saturday against the alleged police role in Gray's death. A small group turned violent. About a dozen young men smashed police vehicles with garbage cans, climbed on top of the cars and stomped on them. Some hurled water bottles and other objects at police. Others funneled their anger toward local businesses, looting or damaging a 7-Eleven, a Michael Kors store and a Subway restaurant. Baltimore police arrested 35 people, including four juveniles. Six officers suffered minor injuries during the chaos, which ended a week of civil and peaceful protests. Gray's twin sister deplored the violence. \"My family wants to say, 'Can y'all please, please stop the violence,' \" Fredericka Gray said Saturday night. \"Freddie Gray would not want this.\" Baltimore City Paper said its photo editor, J.M. Giordano, was tackled and beaten by police while covering the protests. The paper said Giordano was standing near protesters when someone threw a rock at police. Officers responded, and Giordano was unable to get out of the way. \"They just swarmed over me,\" he said. \"I got hit. My head hit the ground. They were hitting me, then someone pulled me out.\" The incident was caught on video, which Baltimore City Paper posted online. And Reuters photographer Sait Serkan Gurbuz said Baltimore police detained him Saturday night. Officers called the detention of the two journalists inadvertent. \"One journalist (Gurbuz) was released with a criminal citation, which is being recalled,\" police said in a statement. \"One journalist (Giordano) was released without any charges.\" Cell phone video of Gray's arrest shows him screaming and being dragged, with some witnesses saying he looked like his leg was injured. Baltimore Police Commissioner Anthony Batts said he was appalled that Gray did not receive proper care immediately. He also said officers should have given Gray timely medical care \"multiple times\" -- such as at the site of the arrest and at other times during his transport to the police station. Batts also said there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled into the transport van. But Baltimore's Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 3 shot back: \"These comments appear to be politically driven and in direct contrast to the commissioner's own request not to jump to any conclusions until the entire investigation is complete,\" union President Gene Ryan said in a written statement. Five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators, Batts said. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions. And while the preliminary work on Gray's autopsy has been completed, the medical examiner's office is waiting on toxicology results and might ask spinal experts to look at the case, authorities said. A full report could take 30 to 45 days. Not just Freddie Gray: Others who died in police custody . Holly Yan reported and wrote from Atlanta; Miguel Marquez reported from Baltimore.

It leaves England looking old-fashioned and they need to react. Stuart Lancaster must be free to pick his best players, no matter where in the world they ply their trade. If Roy Hodgson\u2019s star names moved to Bayern Munich or Barcelona, would the FA tell him not to pick them? Absolutely not. The same needs to apply to rugby. Matt Giteau's stellar displays for Toulon have put him back on the Wallabies radar ahead of the World Cup . The game is changing and Australia have realised that. Matt Giteau and Drew Mitchell, for example, are top-class performers for Toulon and if England lose to Australia with those two playing out of their skins, you know exactly what the headlines will be. The World Cup is simply about the world\u2019s best coming together and ridiculous rules like this demean it. Toulon\u2019s Steffon Armitage came off the bench against Leinster on Sunday and turned the game on its head. His turnover work and ball-carrying are second to none and since he upped sticks to France his game has constantly improved. Toulon's Steffon Armitage takes on the Leinster defence during the Champions Cup semi-final in Marseille . I don\u2019t think Armitage would be playing this well if he was still at London Irish. He took a big risk and it paid off, he shouldn\u2019t be penalised for it. If one or two England back-rowers wouldn\u2019t want to see Armitage in the squad, then that confirms he should be! Nick Abendanon has also become better since he crossed the Channel. It\u2019s simply wrong to say England are best served by players at English clubs. If someone is going to be happier, healthier and a better player overseas, he should be supported. Jonny Wilkinson moved to France and became even better than when he played for England, so that completes the argument for me. Would I have picked Jonny if he was playing in France? Of course I would. Nick Abendanon's game has drastically improved since the former Bath full back made the move to France . As England coach you will be judged on your World Cup performance, even more so as the home team. That\u2019s where you have to deliver the results and selecting your best starting XV is the first thing you have to get right, without exception. When it comes to the big games, the other England players will want to have the best possible squad available. Every player, fan and Englishman wants England to win the World Cup and it starts with picking your best team. When it comes to a home World Cup, you don\u2019t want to be left talking about \u2018what ifs\u2019. England head coach Stuart Lancaster has remained steadfast in his policy not to select overseas players . England players deserve to go on to the field knowing they have been given the best chance of winning. Do the squad truly believe this when such talented players are not considered? They shouldn\u2019t be left to doubt they are playing only because of their home address. This isn\u2019t about being disloyal to the clubs. They benefit from a winning England team, especially in a World Cup year. You simply can\u2019t let the RFU or Premier Rugby tie your hands behind your back and dictate who you can or can\u2019t pick. At Toulon, they\u2019ve got Bryan Habana playing for South Africa and Leigh Halfpenny playing for Wales. They\u2019re among the best players in the world. It\u2019s just crazy and misguided not to make any Englishman available for selection. Well done, Australia. Bryan Habana plays for Toulon but the Springboks have continued to select the winger for Test matches .\n"]}

Responding to the criticism, Mr Oatway said it was vital for people to see the brutality of the anti-immigrant protests that are sweeping the country. He also told how he desperately tried to save Mr Sithole by taking him to a nearby medical centre. But in a desperate twist he found it was closed because the foreign-born doctor had failed to turn up for his shift for fear of being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township.

Sick: As Emmanuel Sithole lay injured in the gutter another thug saw what was going on and joined in the attack using a knife to stab him repeatedly while the first attacked continued to beat him with the wrench . Under siege:\u00a0The brutal attack was captured on camera on Saturday morning by a journalist from South Africa's Sunday Times newspaper who was in the neighbourhood to interview a number of foreign-born shopkeepers who'd had their businesses looted overnight . Beaten: As children played in the streets and onlookers stopped to inspect the damage from the previous evening, the Mozambique-born passer-by was attacked without warning by a man carrying a metal wrench . He told Radio 702's John Robbie: 'The one regret that I have was that the first clinic that we took him to weren't equipped to treat him. 'We did lose some valuable time taking him out of the car there, taking him into the clinic and then the nurses told us that there's no doctor there. 'They put a gauze dressing on his wound and then we put him back in the car, but that whole process took about 10 minutes.' Mr Sithole, who had been found bleeding to death in a gutter, was taken to hospital where he later died, the cause of death established as a direct stab wound to the heart. Mr Oatway also defended his decision to take the images, saying they reflected the 'absolute stark reality' of the situation. Harrowing: A third attacker  then entered the fray, running over and kicking Mr Sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butcher's knife . Brave: Before the man had the chance to use the large knife, a witness intervened and the three attackers fled the scene . He said: 'It's not easy to look at and I understand that some people might be offended by that. 'But really people have to know what's happening, and people have to see the brutality and the vulgarity of what's going on. 'I think that people who are angry with me for taking the pictures... should try and direct their anger at the men that are responsible for the attack and not at me.' Four South African men accused of stabbing Mr Sithole appeared in court yesterday accused of murder. They will remain in custody until a trial, set to be held on May 4.

Dying: Witnesses took Mr Sithole in the back of a car to a nearby medical centre but found it was closed because the foreign-born duty doctor had failed to turn up for his shift because he feared being attacked by the xenophobic hordes rampaging through the township . Fatally wounded:\u00a0In a chilling twist the victim was left bleeding to death in a gutter because the a medical centre just 300 feet away was closed for the day because the doctor who worked there was also a foreigner and feared becoming a victim of a xenophobic attack himself . During the subsequent journey to hospital, Mr Sithole's condition deteriorated as he screamed in agony before eventually falling unconscious . A third attacker - wearing a grey hoodie - then reportedly entered the fray, running over and kicking Mr Sithole in the head as he pulled out a large butcher's knife. Before he had the chance to use the knife a witness intervened and the three men fled the scene. It was too late for Mr Sithole, however, who managed to stumble along the road pleading for help for his fatal injuries before collapsing fatally injured in a rubbish-strewn gutter. Oatway's \u00a0images were published on the front page of South Africa's Sunday Times under the headline: 'Kill thy neighbor: Alex attack brings home SA's shame.' Following the attack, fearful immigrants in South Africa revealed they had been targeted  by longtime neighbors and people who warned they would assault anyone carrying a foreign passport. The immigrants spoke at a tent camp where they are now living having fled Alexandra when the mobs began attacking shops owned by those from other African countries. The violence in Alexandra township followed anti-immigrant riots in and around the coastal city of Durban that killed at least six people, recalling a bout of similar unrest in South Africa in 2008 in which about 60 people died.

Hardy, who signed with the Dallas Cowboys last month, will be forced to sit out the first 10 games of the season and will not receive his salary for these games. This comes almost one year after Hardy, 25, was convicted by a judge in Charlotte, North Carolina of beating, strangling and threatening to kill his ex-girlfriend, Nicki Holder. Those charges were later dropped on an appeal when Holder could not be located to testify. Scroll down for video . The NFL announced today that Greg Hardy (above) would be suspended without pay for 10 games at the start of the 2015 season . Hardy (above) was convicted by a judge last July of beating, strangling and threatening to kill ex-girlfriend Nicki Holder . The decision to ban Hardy followed a two-month NFL investigation that started after the dismissal of his domestic violence case in February. Hardy was informed in a letter by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell that the probe determined there was 'sufficient credible evidence that Hardy engaged in conduct that violated NFL policies in multiple respects.' Hardy was dropped by his previous team, the Carolina Panthers, because of these charges last season, but was still able to collect his salary during that time, which was roughly $770,000 a week. 'I understand that I need to step away from football right now and take care of this legal matter,' Hardy said in a statement after he was cut from the Panthers. The Panthers had originally agreed to wait to take action until Hardy had a jury trial regarding the incident in May. His previous conviction was the result of a bench trial. A jury trial that ultimately led to all charges being dropped.Holder told police that Hardy choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his Charlotte condo. Holder (above with hardy) told police that Hardy choked her, slammed her against a bathtub, threw her to the floor and threatened to kill her after a fight at his condo . This all came at a time when the league was under heavy scrutiny in the wake of two abuse scandals involving stars Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson. Many were upset with the punishments those two received, feeling the NFL was too lenient. Video of Rice punching then-fianc\u00e9e Janay Palmer went public last Monday, and Peterson was indicted on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child on Friday for an incident in which he hit his son with a switch back in May. Rice was definitely suspended from the NFL and had his contract terminated by the Baltimore Ravens, while Peterson, who was sidelined by the Minnesota Vikings last Sunday, has now been suspended by the team. Both men are expected by many to return to play in the 2015, with Peterson back on the Vikings after an NFL decision and Rice winning a wrongful termination suit during the off-season. Rice even pocketed roughly $1.6million in back pay.\n"]}

Superior court Judge Susan Garsh punished Robert Cusanelli of WHDH-TV after two jurors told the court they were trailed by a van as they tried to get into their cars on Wednesday. 'He cannot come into this building or be driving a WHDH vehicle for the purpose of doing reporting work on this case,' Garsh said from the bench after Cusanelli testified under oath. Two jurors informed the court Thursday morning that they saw someone watching them in a Ford Explorer. One took a picture of its license plate. Two jurors from the Aaron Hernandez (pictured in court on Thursday) murder trial told the court they were followed by a TV van as they made their way home in Boston . Robert Cusanelli of Boston's WHDH-TV was banned from the Bristol County courthouse and was told he was not allowed to drive a vehicle for the 'purpose of reporting this case' Cusanelli acknowledged that he followed the jurors, saying he made the decision to do so on his own to find out where jurors were parking. He said he didn't talk to the jurors, didn't take their picture or write down their license plate numbers and at the time thought he wasn't doing anything wrong. 'I see now that it was a mistake,' he said. The van was allegedly behind the jury bus as it headed towards an off-site parking lot where the jurors are dropped off at the end of the day. After learning of the allegations, Garsh called the former New England Patriot player and his lawyers up to have a private discussion at the bench after they arrived in court on Thursday morning. According to WCVB, she said the incident could have resulted in mistrial. According to the Boston Globe, both the jurors are remaining on the panel. 'We're at a stage of this case where it is obviously both vital and legally required that absolutely no juror be approached or questioned or followed in any fashion,' Garsh said at the time. 'It is the court's view that there have to be consequences for that.' Superior Court Judge Susan Garsh has warned the TV station there could be repercussions following the incident that was reported in court on Thursday . The station was told to 'investigate' the matter before reporting back to the court. The 12 jurors spent a combined nine hours deliberating on Tuesday and Wednesday. They continued deliberating after the judge questioned the jurors involved and spoke to the attorney but did not reach a verdict on Thursday. They will return on Friday as Hernandez awaits his fate. Hernandez is charged with the June 2013 shooting death of Odin Lloyd, who was dating his fianc\u00e9e's sister. Lloyd was shot six times in an industrial park less than a mile from Hernandez's home. Jurors must deliberate every day from 9am to 4:30 pm., and may go later if they wish. On Wednesday they asked the judge for clarification on weapon and ammunition possession charges Hernandez faces. The judge brought the jury in Wednesday afternoon after receiving two questions about the possession charges. Hernandez is charged with illegally possessing a .45-caliber handgun and .22-caliber ammunition. The former New England Patriots player Aaron Hernandez speaks to defense attorney Charles Rankin in the courtroom of the Bristol County Superior Court House on April 8, 2015. The jury are now deliberating . Two friends of Hernandez, Ernest Wallace and Carlos Ortiz, are also charged with murder and will be tried separately. Prosecutors contend that the three men, in the early hours of June 17, 2013, picked Lloyd up at his home in Boston and drove him to the industrial park where his body was found riddled with bullets later that day. During the trial, which began in January and featured more than 130 witnesses, prosecutors showed video footage of Hernandez coming and going from his home around the time of Lloyd's death. Investigators did not recover the gun that was used to shoot Lloyd, a .45-caliber Glock pistol. Hernandez faces a charge of murder and two firearms-related violations. If convicted of first-degree murder, he would be sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. A second-degree murder conviction would lead to a life sentence with the possibility of parole after 15 years. Hernandez had been a rising star in the National Football League with a $41 million contract when he was arrested on June 26, 2013. The Patriots dropped him within hours.\n"]}

Trotting into Aintree in a collection of floral, flamboyant and eye-catching numbers, thousands of female race-goers displayed their indomitable spirit for the occasion. Clearly taking the 'Chanel-inspired' style guide to heart, many opted for outfits that wouldn't have been out of place at a wedding - whether as part of the bridal party or as the bride herself. Others seemed to have taken heed of the sunshine and instead sported full-skirted looks bedecked with blooms in pastel shades of lemon, periwinkle and peach. Most, however, were intent on nothing more than enjoying the blissful weather with many opening proceedings with a mini bottle of champagne, quaffed with the help of a booze funnel. The occasion may have commenced with glamorous group photos and sunny selfies but as Ladies' Day rolled on, the hours of drinking appeared to take their toll, not only on the female race fans but their outfits as well. Wardrobe malfunctions hit many a low-cut dress and thigh-length frock and some even chose to flash their bottom for photographers, while others struggled to keep their composure on a wooden racehorse. As the mid-afternoon sun beamed over Aintree, balancing in high heels and platforms presented more of a challenge and race-goers were seen staggering around the grounds.

Although the European champions would like to sign De Gea this June, they are looking at the possibility of picking up Chelsea's Petr Cech to fill the gap in between, while the Spaniard runs down his contract at Old Trafford, which expires next year. Real Madrid's attempt to nab David De Gea is the big story in AS, while Marca focus on James Rodriguez . In a move that Spanish paper AS calls 'Operation De Gea', the paper claims Real are only prepared to pay for the keeper if United 'fix a reasonable price' - otherwise they will nab him for free in a year. De Gea's contract is up at Old Trafford in the summer of 2016, and he is yet to sign a new deal, with United still uncertain of Champions League football for next season. Cech, meanwhile, looks certain to leave Stamford Bridge this summer, with the Czech keeper likely to command a fee of around \u00a310million. Elsewhere in Spain the focus is on Lionel Messi's injury, which is still causing him some problems ahead of Barcelona's trip to Celta Vigo on Sunday.

The French coach, however, admits the possibility Liverpool could use their interest in Sanchez as leverage during negotiations over Luis Suarez's move to the Nou Camp last summer was always on the cards. Alexis Sanchez was courted by a number of elite clubs last summer but eventually chose Arsenal . Sanchez has made an instant impact in English football and has scored 19 goals so far this season . Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger (right) is delighted that Sanchez decided to join the north London club . 'At the end of the day, only Sanchez can explain to you why he has chosen us. I don't know why he did that, but we are happy that he made that decision,' said Wenger of the \u00a332million Chile forward, who has netted 19 goals so far. 'I was (aware of Liverpool's interest), but you never know if it is really true, but I thought it could be because of the interest in Suarez (from Barcelona). 'In the negotiations, yes, it is a strength - and it makes sense, an exchange and some money for Liverpool.' Wenger believes the way Sanchez has adapted so quickly to a change in environment proves he is one of the best around. 'If you look at the qualities, efficiency, work-rate, fighting spirit - (he is at the) top,' the Arsenal boss added. 'When it (the game) becomes flat, he can revitalise the strengths and dynamics of the team and the supporters.' Ahead of the key Barclays Premier League clash, Wenger was keen to play down any talk of a potential summer transfer move for Liverpool forward Raheem Sterling, who has so far rejected a new contract offer. Despite the Reds having lost to Manchester United before the international break to dent hopes of another top-four finish, Wenger has been impressed by the way Brendan Rodgers has developed his team following the sale of Suarez and injury to striker Daniel Sturridge. 'He has done very well. I think he found a solution at the right time,' the Arsenal manager said. 'They did well last season too, they scored over 100 goals in the Premier League, which is absolutely fantastic.'

She added that beginning when she was nine years old up until she was 13, Rebbie would come into her bedroom while she was sleeping and molest her, according to Philly.com. Investigators found 41 videos from the hidden camera that included footage of the girl and others while they used the bathroom, 34 of which showed victims as they showered. Rebbie uploaded the videos, some that included close-up images of children's genitalia, to his computer to view later, prosecutors said. The videos were captured over a three- or four-year time period, according to prosecutors.

Marylin Stoneman had been entrusted with the vulnerable victim's pin number,\u00a0cheque books and bank cards to manage his financial affairs after he went into\u00a0care at Cedar House, Rothley.

U.S. Attorney Ronald Machen, on his last day in office, told House Speaker John Boehner in a seven-page letter that Lerner could wrap herself in the U.S. Constitution's Fifth Amendment, even though she offered a self-serving opening statement before clamming up\u00a0during a May 22, 2013 hearing. Lerner has long been in the GOP's crosshairs because she led the IRS department tasked with approving nonprofit groups' applications for tax-exempt status. Beginning in 2010, the department gave conservative groups with words like 'patriots' or 'tea party' in their names extra scrutiny, slow-walking their applications and keping many in limbo for years. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee had subpoenaed Lerner after she refused to testify voluntarily about her role in the scandal. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS AND THE DOJ'S LETTER TO BOEHNER . I'LL TELL THE TRUTH ... UNLESS I'M TAKING THE FIFTH: Former IRS official Lois Lerner insisted on her innocence in an opening statement during a 2013 congressional hearing, and then refused to answer lawmakers' questions \u2013 a choice that the Obama administration now says was perfectly legal . U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia Ronald Machen (left) dropped his bomb on Congress just one day before leaving office to return to private legal practice . Emailed? Machen's letter was addressed to House Speaker John Boehner (left), who was in Jerusalem visiting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (right) When she refused again to answer questions during a second hearing on March 5, 2014, House Republicans prepared a criminal contempt citation and referred the case to the Justice Department once it was approved. California Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, then the Oversight committee's chairman, told Lerner in one hearing that she had 'effectively waived your rights' by defending herself under oath. 'I have not done anything wrong,' Lerner had said in the 2013 hearing. 'I have not broken any laws, I have not violated any IRS rules or regulations, and I have not provided false information to this or any other congressional committee.' Machen told Boehner on Tuesday that since Lerner had only made 'general claims of innocence,' she was within her rights to refuse to answer questions. 'Ms. Lemer's general denials of wrongdoing did not amount to \"testimony\" about the actual facts under the Committee's review,' he said. 'The Fiflh Amendment to the Constitution would provide Ms. Lerner with an absolute defense, should she be prosecuted ,,, for her refusal to testify.' Machen's March 31 letter arrived on Capitol Hill just a day before his resignation took effect after a five-year stint as Washington, D.C.'s top federal prosecutor inside the Justice Department. President Barack Obama named him to his post in December 2009. Reactions swept through the nation's capital as word spread that Lerner was, legally, in the clear. 'Once again, the Obama administration has tried to sweep IRS targeting of taxpayers for their political beliefs under the rug,' Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told Daily Mail Online. 'But unaccountable federal bureaucrats using their power to attack the First Amendment strikes at the heart of our democracy, and the American people deserve the truth.' 'The White House,' said Steel, 'still has the opportunity to do the right thing and appoint a special counsel to examine the IRS\u2019 actions.' Attorney General Eric Holder has refused repeatedly to bring in a special counsel, instead appointing attorney Barbara Bosserman to lead an internal probe. Republicans see Bosserman as a politically conflicted choice: Federal Election Commission records show that she donated a total of $6,750 to  Obama\u2019s campaigns and to the Democratic National Committee. SWITCH: During the tea party targeting hearings, it was Oversight committee ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings (left) who was regularly exasperated \u2013 but now Darrell Issa (right), his Republican foil at the time is frustrated by a lack of accountability for Lerner . Tea party groups and other conservative organizations seeking tax-exempt status were kept in limbo for years while the IRS often green-lighted liberal groups in weeks or months . Issa, whose outrage led to the congressional contempt citation against Lerner \u2013 and one against Holder, for refusing to turn over documents related to the scandal \u2013 was livid. 'Refusing to prosecute Mrs. Lerner and Mr. Holder after they were held in contempt by a vote of the House of Representatives sends a disturbing message that it is permissible for senior government officials to lie to Congress and to ignore subpoenas for information vital to Congressional investigations,' he said Wednesday in a statement. Issa's successor as chairman of the Oversight committee, Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, said Machen's letter 'exhibits a disregard for the rule of law' and scoffed at his objectivity. 'It is unclear whether the Administration directed Mr. Machen not to prosecute Lois Lerner, or whether he was motivated by an ideological kinship with IRS\u2019s leadership,' Chaffetz said. 'The Committee will continue to pursue its ongoing investigation into the targeting of American citizens based on their political beliefs. Our goal is to ensure that the people responsible, including Lois Lerner, are held accountable.' Lerner's attorney, William Taylor, said in a statement that his client 'looks forward to moving on with her life.' 'It is unfortunate that the majority party in the House put politics before a citizen's constitutional rights,' Taylor said. DOJ Letter to Boehner About Lois Lerner uploaded by DailyMail.com .\n"]}

A British expat accused of murdering his wife in Portugal has admitted burying her body in the garden but denies killing her, claiming she must have died during a bungled burglary. Nigel Jackson, 59, was arrested at his country home in Alvor, near Portimao in the Algarve, in January, after the body of his wife Brenda Davidson, 72, was found in a shallow grave outside. At the time Jackson claimed Mrs Davidson committed suicide after being diagnosed with ovarian and thyroid cancer. But after being shown evidence she was killed, he had now changed his story. In a letter from jail entitled 'LOVE, CARE DEVOTION AND BETRAYAL', seen by the Daily Mirror, Jackson said Mrs Davidson must have been killed by intruders. However, he sticks to the rest of his original story, saying he buried her in his garden with their beloved pets, which they called 'babies', because he thought it's what she would have wanted. He wrote: 'As I thought it was her choice I honoured her choice that night to bury her with our babies. 'I told everyone she had gone away...this was the only lie I told and I could not live with this lie so I went to the consulate and asked them to get the police.' He described the moment he found his wife's body in a pool of blood, claiming to have held the corpse for hours begging her to wake up before discovering the knife and a wound on her neck. Jackson is accused of murdering his wife at his home in Alvor, in the Algarve (pictured). At the time he denied causing her death, saying she had killed herself, but now says she died during a burglary . He also admits to moving his mistress of three years into the house as Mrs Davidson's body lay in the garden, but said the affair was no secret. He maintains that after her cancer diagnosis his wife had acknowledged that he still had needs to fulfill, and had given her blessing, provided he didn't 'bring it home'. Jackson said he moved his partner into the house in an attempt to get over his wife's death, adding: 'I was trying to move on but I could not do so.' Jackson was initially arrested in January this year after Mrs Davidson's son Dean became concerned about her whereabouts. According to neighbours, Jackson had initially said she had returned to the UK 'for treatment for a nasty cough.' But when she failed to return to their home  Jackson then alerted the authorities and told them he was 'dedicated himself to trying to find her.' However her son eventually contacted police and Jackson was arrested at their home and questioned by police for several hours. Mrs Davidson's body was found in the garden of her home in Alvor (pictured), buried in shallow grave, while Jackson had moved his mistress into the main house . It was then that he revealed the location of the body of Mrs Davidson, his wife of 27 years. Police believe she died last November before the body was wrapped in plastic sheeting and placed underneath a concrete slab and bricks in the garden. The couple moved to the Algarve around 10 years ago from their home in Rochester, Kent and had built up a close set of friends in the close-knit village. They had apparently got bored of their life in Kent and Mr Jackson, a former taxi driver, and his wife, a retired cleaner, moved to Portugal for a change of scene.

It seems that the BBC has lost the plot with its radio dramas. Frustrated listeners say the vital last minutes of numerous shows have been left off versions uploaded to the iPlayer service. They branded the problem \u2018irritating\u2019, \u2018annoying\u2019 and \u2018frustrating\u2019 and said it was ruining their enjoyment of the programmes. Shows such as Dad\u2019s Army and Hancock\u2019s Half Hour have all fallen foul of the problem, which the BBC blames on the system it uses to record programmes. It says the live sections of radio stations cause the start and end times of programmes to shift, confusing the automatic recording system. But this is not a new problem for the corporation and has been on its radar for at least three years. It was raised by the BBC\u2019s own Feedback programme in February 2012 but, with the issue still persisting now, listeners have been forced to again approach the Radio 4 programme, which deals with audience complaints. One said: \u2018Do you have any idea how irritating, annoying, frustrating it is to attempt to listen again [to a programme] only for the last few minutes to be cut off?

There's the elegant setting, VIP guests in tuxedos and designer gowns and a four-course meal served up by America's most famous kitchen. But don't get your hopes up. President Barack Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry S. Truman, who left office 62 years ago. In his first six years, Obama held just seven state dinners and will hold at least two more this year: for the leaders of Japan, on April 28, and China, later in the year. Scroll down for video . Frugal entertainer: President Barack Obama (center) offers a toast on stage to French President Francois Hollande at the State Dinner on the South Lawn of the White House in Washington. Obama has held the fewest number of state dinners since Harry S. Truman, who left office 62 years ago. Obama hosted just seven . One of the lucky few: First lady Michelle Obama and President Barack Obama welcome French President Francois Hollande for a State Dinner at the North Portico of the White House in February 2014 . Truman, who became president in 1945, held six dinners during nearly eight years in office. Shrouded in pageantry, a White House state dinner is the highest diplomatic honour the U.S. reserves for allies and other countries. It's also one of the most lavish affairs the government puts on. The State Department pays the entire tab, which averaged about $500,000 each for Obama's seven dinners, said White House spokesman Patrick Ventrell. Ventrell and others said cost was a concern when Obama took office in January 2009 amid the worst economic slide since the 1930s. Officials were sensitive to the economic distress blanketing the country and were looking for other ways the president could cement relationships with foreign leaders without spending hundreds of thousands of public dollars on an opulent black-tie dinner. Obama held his first state dinner toward the end of his first year in office, honoring then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Obama held his first state dinner toward the end of his first year in office, honouring then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh (pictured, above with his wife\u00a0Gursharan Kaur (far left) Other dinners included one for  British Prime Minister David Cameron and his wife Samantha in March 2012 . Barack Obama has held seven state dinners so far and plans at least two more this year. 2009: Then-Indian PM Manmohan Singh . 2010: Then-Mexican President Felipe Calderon . 2011: Then-Chinese President Hu Jintao . 2011: German Chancellor Angela Merkel . 2011: Then-South Korean President Lee Myung-bak . 2012: British Prime Minister David Cameron . 2014: French President Francois Hollande . 2015: Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, scheduled for April 28 . 2015: Chinese President Xi Jinping . Later dinners were for Mexico, China, Germany, South Korea, Britain and France. Aides say Obama's overall level of engagement with foreign counterparts and the different ways he interacts with them is more important than the number of state dinners penciled on his calendar. 'State dinners are one tool of diplomacy that can be used and used effectively and sometimes we use them,' Ventrell said. Obama has met hundreds of times with his counterparts and other foreign officials in settings as formal as the Oval Office and as casual as a Hawaiian golf course. They also speak by phone. 'There's no concern that should be raised by the number of state dinners,' said Capricia Marshall, who led the State Department team that oversees visits by foreign dignitaries until she stepped down in 2013. Lyndon B. Johnson topped the 11 presidents who followed Truman, cramming 54 state dinners into his 62-month tenure in the Oval Office, White House Historical Association data show. Ronald Reagan, the actor-turned-politician who knew a thing or two about entertaining, held 52 dinners during two terms. Even Jimmy Carter, who liked to project an image of frugality, managed 28 state dinners in four years as president. A state dinner for a foreign leader marks the finale of a state visit, which opens with herald trumpets and cannon salutes on the South Lawn of the White House, followed by meetings, a joint news conference with the U.S. president and an elaborate State Department luncheon. Then comes the state dinner, where a tuxedo-clad president raises a glass and toasts relations between the countries in front of hundreds of invited guests, ranging from Cabinet secretaries and other senior administration officials to members of Congress, business leaders, celebrities and others, as well as the working media. President Gerald Ford dances with Queen Elizabeth during the state dinner in her honour in July 1976 . 'Make no mistake about it: every country wants to have a state visit,' said Ann Stock, a White House social secretary under President Bill Clinton. Obama and recent presidents have used multiple formats and settings apart from a state dinner to forge ties with their counterparts. In 2013, Obama met Chinese President Xi Jinping at the Sunnylands retreat in Southern California. Obama returned there the following year to consult with Jordan's King Abdullah II. Obama also took German Chancellor Angela Merkel to dinner at the upscale 1789 restaurant in Georgetown; French President Francois Hollande to the Virginia estate of Thomas Jefferson, a former president and former U.S. ambassador to France; and British Prime Minister David Cameron to an NCAA tournament game in Ohio. On Hawaii vacations, Obama has shared his golf game with Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak and New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. George W. Bush welcomed more than a dozen foreign leaders to his Texas ranch, which became a popular venue for Bush's brand of casual diplomacy. He even treated then-Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to a tour of Graceland, the Memphis, Tennessee, home of Elvis Presley, one of Koizumi's musical idols. Reagan welcomed Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip to his Santa Barbara, California, ranch. Richard Nixon received Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev at his home in San Clemente, California. The origins of the state dinner were rooted in the the early 19th Century when they were held to honor the president's cabinet, Congress or other dignitaries, according to the White House Historical Association. At the time, the city consisted of a collection of isolated and separated villages that were almost inaaccessible, so large receptions or dinners were rare. It wasn't until the late 19th Century that the term state dinner referred specifically to a meal hosted by the president for a foreign head of state as the guest of honour. The first ruling monarch to attend a state dinner at the White House was King David Kalakaua of the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), hosted by President Ulysses S. Grant on December 12, 1874.\n"]}
{"question_id": 414, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Whether it is through Sir Bradley Wiggins, Geraint Thomas or Ian Stannard, Ireland's classics king Sean Kelly believes the time has come for Team Sky to break their duck in one of cycling's Monuments. With the two major cobbled classics - the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix - looming large over the next two weekends, it is time to see the early results of Sir Dave Brailsford's move to put more emphasis on the Spring Classics in his second five-year plan for Team Sky. With Wiggins electing to sign off his Team Sky career with an appearance at Paris-Roubaix on April 12, the races are bound to be a big part of the team's season whatever the outcome. British Bradley Wiggins competes during the  the Gent-Wevelgem one day cycling race on March 29 . The shift in emphasis has already paid dividends in the early part of the season, with Stannard defending his title at Omloop Het Nieuwsblad, Team Sky's third victory in the Belgian race, while Thomas last week won E3 Harelbeke - a key warm-up for this weekend's Tour of Flanders. Kelly, whose record of nine Monument wins puts him in a tie for third all-time, likes what he sees from Team Sky as the big races approach. 'Right now they're looking really good,' Kelly said. 'They've been very impressive in the semi-classics. Can they finish it off by winning a big one?' Team Sky's focus on the Grand Tours up to now has left them short of riders equipped to win classics, while the usually chaotic nature of the races is anathema to their favoured controlling tactics. But the development of Stannard and Thomas gives Team Sky two in-house contenders, while Wiggins raised eyebrows with his ninth-placed finish in Paris-Roubaix last year and he vowed to return. Luke Rowe could also be another British option for the team. Ian Stannard (3rd from front) rides in the\u00a0Gent-Wevelgem one-day cycling race on March 29 . Injuries to classics specialists Fabian Cancellara (Trek Factory) and Tom Boonen (Etixx-QuickStep) - although the latter may return in time for Paris-Roubaix - add to the impression that Team Sky's best chance may be now. 'Without Cancellara, without Boonen, it's going to be a more open race,' said Kelly, who will commentate on both the Tour of Flanders and Paris-Roubaix for Eurosport. 'There's going to be eight-10 guys saying they can win and Sky have three of them. Geraint is certainly in there, Stannard is maybe a little bit under his best after his crash (in the first Monument, Milan-San Remo on March 22) but can come back, and then of course there is Wiggins.' Of the three, Wiggins is yet to show the sort of form this season which suggests he can win Paris-Roubaix, but Kelly is not counting the 2012 Tour de France winner out, saying a Monument win to add to his Tour and world time trial success would elevate Wiggins to 'another level'. 'If you look at the way he's performing at the moment, for me, it's not as good as I would like him to be in the recent races, but you can't go to Paris-Roubaix with only one card to play,' Kelly said. Geraint Thomas celebrates placing third in the Belgian cycling classic Ghent-Wevelgem . 'With Thomas and Stannard as well, you play all of those cards and the rest look after them. If you can get to the final 10-12km and Wiggins is still there, that is where he can go on the attack.' To get to that point, Team Sky will need to be in survival mode in a usually attritional race known as 'the Hell of the North'. The brutal cobbled stretches, which require huge amounts of effort while increasing the chances of crashes and mechanical problems, create a nervousness in the peloton which makes planning all but impossible. Although Kelly never won the Tour of Flanders, finishing second in 1984, he was victorious in Paris-Roubaix twice, 1984 and 1986, and said the fear of the cobbles is something that never really left him. 'When I first went there I had a horrendous time - I was very nervous on the cobbles and I wasn't able to ride them well,' he said. 'I slowly developed and I was able to manage to ride them, but even when I got to the point of being a Paris-Roubaix favourite it's still very nervous times. 'It's a horrible race to ride, but a great race to win.'\n"]}

Overall, the UK came 11th in the table of countries with the highest standards of prosperity, health and tolerance, putting Britain outside the top ten most civilised and best-off people in the world . Despite national earnings that make us the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity. We also got low placings for lack of religious tolerance, crime rates that are only middling by world standards and for the speed at which we soak up water resources and destroy natural habitats. The findings recorded by US analysts in a \u2018social progress index\u2019 suggest that the fast economic recovery from the recession has done little to ease longstanding problems that blight the lives of millions. The analysts, led by a Harvard Business School academic, based their research on the idea that financial records do not tell the whole truth about a country. The same thinking has driven David Cameron to order Whitehall to start collecting measurements of happiness and well-being. The social progress league table has been drawn up on the basis of ratings of essential medical care and everyday nutrition; on housing and energy standards; crime; education; health and fitness; political and conscience rights and freedoms, and levels of tolerance. It broadly reflects the concerns of liberal and Left-wing thinkers \u2013 for example countries are marked up if girls do not marry young, if contraception is universally available, and for low greenhouse gas emissions, but there are no rankings that take into account factors such as family break-up or single parenthood. Index chief Michael Green said: \u2018Overall, within Europe the UK\u2019s ranking is middle of the road: it is more socially advanced than the US, Belgium, France, Ireland or Spain, but loses out to all the Nordic countries, Canada and Australia. Despite national earnings making the UK the world\u2019s fifth richest country, living standards are driven down by poor health and fitness, particularly obesity, as well as a lack of religious tolerance and crime (file picture) \u2018The UK is let down by its disappointing score on health and wellness, and like many rich countries the UK\u2019s lowest score is on ecosystem sustainability.\u2019 The table \u2013 which says Norway followed by Sweden and Switzerland are the best-off countries in the world \u2013 lists only four EU countries in the top ten. It says that Italy, at 31, is doing less well than Costa Rica, Chile or Uruguay. Israel is even further down the table, below Argentina and Mauritius. Britain is first in the world, according to the researchers, for conquering hunger, providing water and sanitation, for electricity supply, a low murder rate, adult literacy, and freedom of speech and movement. It also wins top spot for the number of globally-recognised universities, for low levels of women marrying at young ages, and for numbers of mobile phone users. However the UK is 32nd for its comparatively high rates of deaths from infectious disease, and 33rd for public concern about crime. For freedom of religion Britain is 50th, and for religious tolerance 80th. There are also poor results for the proportion of water resources that are taken for human use, where we are placed at 82 in the world, and for destruction of wildlife habitat, where we are 53rd.

Stadium:\u00a0Parc de Princes . BY ADAM CRAFTON . Lionel Messi is playing with joy again, and bringing the best out of Neymar and Suarez, too. The Catalans have scored more goals than any Champions League team away from home this season \u2014 and all have come from their forward trio. Suarez has 11 goals in his last 11 games for Barcelona, and six in six in the Champions League. Liverpool fans will not enjoy hearing this, but he seems at home. So maybe it has something to do with the players after all. Suarez wasn\u2019t schooled in tiki-taka or the Barcelona way, but the combination of an energetic high pressing game married to quite gorgeous technique and invention fits him like a glove. As Barcelona\u2019s old boss, Pep Guardiola, struggled with his new group against Porto, Barcelona marched on, their philosophy enduring beyond coaches or academies. They buy great players, and these players often do great things. That is the Barcelona way too. Paris St-Germain got a late and lucky consolation goal that some will feel keeps this tie competitive, but for those of a more earthbound persuasion it is hard to see it as anything but over. Suarez killed it with his two goals leaving PSG to seek a 3-0 win at the Nou Camp inside 90 minutes to progress. And they haven\u2019t got nil in them \u2014 not against this trio. David Luiz was Suarez\u2019s victim here, and he took chunks out of his reputation, without so much as a baring of teeth. For once, though, sympathy was with the Brazilian. A hamstring injury was due to keep him out for a month \u2014 and that was just 10 days ago. Shorn of key individuals by injury and suspension, Laurent Blanc started with Luiz on the bench \u2014 and was forced to promote him to the action after 21 minutes when Thiago Silva limped out of the game. Barcelona were already ahead by then and instantly one feared for Luiz against opponents with such flair and movement. It took a while, but eventually those fears were realised. Luiz, to his credit, was up for it \u2014 he just wasn\u2019t up to it, which is different entirely. Suarez would have known that, and known Luiz\u2019s defensive frailties even when fit from his time in the Premier League, and the way the goals were scored suggested he had no compunction capitalising on it either. Suarez scores his first goal of the night to make it 2-0 to Barcelona after bustling past three PSG defenders .

Suarez runs away to celebrate his goal as he joined by his ecstatic team-mate Neymar, who had earlier made it 1-0 to Barcelona . Suarez is mobbed by his jubilant Barcelona team-mates after his first goal as they enjoy their trip to France . Basically, to get nut-megged once is unfortunate; to have it happen twice suggests someone is trying to make you look a twit. This was street football \u2014 and not for the first time Luiz was cast as the plaything of a hapless gamer. What skill by Suarez, though. Collecting the ball on the right flank, he turned and put it through Luiz\u2019s legs, leaving him helpless and unable to recover. Suarez then held off two PSG players as he darted through the tightest of gaps into the penalty area, finishing past an equally defeated keeper Salvatore Sirigu. His next was even better. Through the middle, charging directly at Luiz, embarrassing him with a nutmeg again, before finishing in style, an absolute gem of a goal. It is hard to imagine how, even with the fillip of Gregory van der Wiel\u2019s deflected shot, PSG can claw this back. Blanc\u2019s team have enormous spirit as Chelsea discovered and held their end up here, too, but Barcelona simply have too much class. They took their chances and PSG did not \u2014 a fatal flaw with the odds already stacked against them.

Barcelona worked the ball well for Neymar to open the scoring - CLICK HERE to read our brilliant match zone from the game . Edinson Cavani was the prime culprit and he had a night of clumsy control and missed opportunity when it mattered most. Javier Pastore, too. Eric Cantona says that he is the best player in the world, better than Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo \u2014 but not all of Eric\u2019s statements are shot through with wisdom. Pastore set the tone for PSG in front of goal, by making a hash of their first chance of the night. When they did finally score it was only because a tame shot by Van der Wiel took a spiteful deflection off substitute Jeremy Mathieu. Barcelona started well and could have gone ahead when Messi hit a post with a curling 20-yard shot after 14 minutes. It served as a warning and four minutes later Barcelona went ahead. The move began, as so many do, with Sergio Busquets breaking up play. From there, Barcelona countered with terrifying speed, Messi feeding Neymar, who finished astutely with only Sirigu to beat. He could have had another after 26 minutes when a fine jinking run forced a good save. Javier Pastore fluffs his lines as he misses a brilliant chance to put PSG 1-0 up against the run of play . Gregory van der Wiel's (left) late deflected effort gave PSG a glimmer of hope ahead of the second leg next week . Shortly before half-time the Italian was needed again, when Luiz took on too much sweeping up at the back and was caught in possession by Suarez. He curled a shot which Sirigu plucked out of the air, the last time he would get the better of their exchanges. Not everything Barcelona does is beautiful, however. Jordi Alba\u2019s dive under pressure from Thiago Silva after five minutes was deeply unimpressive and deserved a booking. Mark Clattenburg, the referee, ducked out of that one, although he did later book Messi. One to tell the grandkids, no doubt, although they might be more interested in a retelling of Suarez\u2019s goals.

Photographs taken of her vehicle show her sandals remained resting in the footwell of the driver's seat, while the exterior of the white vehicle was left stained with her blood. While investigators declined to speculate on a motive for the killing, friends and colleagues immediately described her death as a targeted assassination in Pakistan - a country with a nascent democracy where the military and intelligence services still hold tremendous sway. Scroll down for video . Assassinated women's rights activist Sabeen Mahmud's sandals remain in the footwell of her car, where she was gunned down on Friday night . A Pakistani cameraman films her car hours after she was gunned down by two men on a motorcycle . Pakistani police officers examine the damaged car, who was killed as she returned to her home in Karachi . The gunmen shot both Mahmud and her mother, Mehnaz Mahmud, as they stopped at a traffic light Friday night in an upscale Karachi neighborhood, senior police officer Zafar Iqbal said. Later, journalists saw their car at a nearby police station, the front driver's side window smashed out and the pair of sandals on the floorboard with broken glass all around them. Blood stained the car's white body. 'Two men riding a motorcycle opened fire on the car,' Iqbal said, adding that Mehmud 'died on her way to the hospital. Her mother was also wounded.' Alia Chughtai, a close friend of Mahmud, said that she was driving at the time of attack and her mother was sitting next to her. She added that Mahmud's driver, who escaped unharmed, was sitting in the back seat at the time of the attack but she was unsure why the driver wasn't driving the car. Mr Iqbal and other police officials declined to offer a motive for the slaying. However, earlier that night Mahmud hosted an event at her organization called The Second Floor to discuss human rights in Baluchistan, an impoverished but resource-rich southwestern province bordering Iran. Thousands of people have disappeared from the province in recent years amid a government crackdown on nationalists and insurgent groups there. Activists blame the government for the disappearances, something authorities deny. Qadeer Baluch, an activist who last year led a nearly 3,000-kilometer (1,900-mile) protest march across Pakistan to demand justice for the missing in Baluchistan, attended the event. He hinted that the government could be involved in Mahmud's slaying. People carry the casket Sabeen Mahmud, who was killed by two unknown gunmen on a motorcycle . 'Everybody knows who killed her and why,' Baluch told Pakistan's The Nation newspaper, without elaborating. 'The programme organisers were already receiving threats. It is very difficult to talk about Baluchistan in Pakistan.' Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif condemned Mahmud's killing and ordered an investigation into the attack. The U.S. Embassy in Islamabad also condemned Mahmud's slaying and offered condolences to her loved ones. Mahmud was 'a courageous voice of the Pakistani people and her death represents a great loss,' it said. She was a well-known activist who also ran a small tech company, hosted poetry readings, computer workshops and other events at The Second Floor. She continued to live in Karachi, Pakistan's southern port city, even while acknowledging the danger from insurgent groups and criminals operating there. 'Fear is just a line in your head,' Mahmud told Wired magazine in 2013. 'You can choose what side of that line you want to be on.' Pakistan's powerful army condemned the killing, pledging that the country's intelligence agencies would assist in the investigation.

These three Mormons, all from Utah, have realized that they are transgender - a designation not officially recognized by the Church of Latter Day Saints. Indeed, church doctrine states that anybody who takes their transgender identity to the extent of gender reassignment surgery cannot be baptized - and could face discipline from church elders if they are already a member of the religion. However, in the case of Annabel Jensen, Grayson Moore and Sara Jade Woodhouse, they have found a way to exist within the Mormon universe - often with the help of local Mormon leaders. Scroll down for video . Struggles: Grayson Moore, left with his mother, and Annabel Jensen, right, have both transitioned gender. Grayson used to be Grace and Annabel was once Christopher . Changed: Sara Jade Woodhouse, above, changed gender much later in life. As a man, she had married and fathered a child . As an extensive profile of the three in the Salt Lake Tribune newspaper reveals, the three have managed stay devout members of the church while navigating the difficulties of their gender identity. According to the Tribune, around 30 transgender Mormons meet every week in a support group, and have started to get the attention of senior church members. Grayson Moore, 22, is a math student at the University of Utah, and first came to terms with being transgender in junior high. Until then, he had been known as Grace, but made the decision to throw out his girls' clothes, swap his name to Grayson and start living as a male. Therapy: Moore, pictured above at home in Syracuse, Utah, started taking testosterone hormones several years after switching to wearing boys' clothes . Several years later he began testosterone therapy, which has made his body more masculine. He attends an all-male congregation, but is officially still listed as female by the church. He told the Tribune that after being told about gender identity disorder by his mother, he prayed to God asking 'Am I your son?' and felt the answer was 'yes'. While he understood the change would be hard, he said 'there was a bigger risk in not transitioning.' Accepted: Jensen told how she was welcomed when telling a Mormon bishop of her transgender identity . 'Living that lie was killing me.' Annabel Jensen, who was born Christopher, got as far as being ordained as a Mormon elder and was lined up to go on a two-year mission before she confronted her identity as a woman. She came out to her family, who told her she couldn't wear women's clothes and insisted on using her old name. Jensen, who is estranged from her parents and siblings, now lives alone and has started taking hormones to be more female. She said: 'One of my brothers sent me a text calling me a monster. I miss my family, but I don't want to visit. It's become too painful.' However, she has found solace in the church, and says the bishop of her ward was unambiguous about letting her join in. She remembers him saying: 'I\u00a0don't know anything about being a transgender Mormon - but it's my job to welcome you.' Sara Jade Woodhouse had already grown up, and had a wife a child by the time she embraced her female identity, which she says she felt since grade school. She separated from her wife after deciding she could go no longer without changing her identity. She explained the switch to her daughter, then five, who said she found it 'weird' but looked forward to playing dolls with her. Woodhouse remains devout but is not allowed to attend the Relief Society - an all-female organization within the church. Difficult: Woodhouse has not been allowed to participate in some female Mormon activities, but says that she believes her gender identity is compatible with Mormon teachings . However, she believes that church doctrine on gender being eternal and unchangeable is compatible with her situation. She told the Tribune: 'We know that some people are born with ambiguous genitalia or with both - it is absolutely possible for a perfect feminine soul to end up in a male body and vice versa.' Even the most senior members of the church are starting to take notice of the Mormon transgender population. Dallin H. Oaks, one of the twelve apostles who are in the top echelon of the church hierarchy, said more needs to be done. He told the Tribune: '[Mormon leaders] have not had so much experience with [transgender persons]... We have some unfinished business on that.'\n"]}

Shaw added: 'He has two sides to him, but he is genuinely a really nice guy and a great manager.

England's top three are exceptional players but the issue is that they are very one-paced and when the West Indies bowling was so disciplined, that became a problem on the first morning of the first Test. It is OK batting the way England did if they had got through to lunch on 60 without loss, but they will be exposed against better teams than West Indies, like Australia, if they crash to 34 for three in the first session as they did here. As a player I would never worry about the pace runs came as long as they came. You are there to win games. But now I appreciate the need to entertain as well and the way the top three go about things might become a bit monotonous. Joe Root (left) and Ian Bell (right) put on 177 runs for the fourth wicket on day one in Antigua . Bell raises his bat to the crowd after scoring his 22nd Test match century at the Sir Viv Richards Stadium . OK, if they stay in the runs will come and England supporters will be happy but it should be remembered that England have promised to play a certain way. You have to give Jonathan Trott huge credit for battling his way back to Test cricket but a bit of a\u00a0risk has been taken with him because if it doesn't come off it will look like another big decision that England have got wrong. As for captain Alastair Cook, he has been working hard with Graham Gooch and has opened his shoulder up a bit, but the pitched up delivery continues to get him out. Ben Stokes was unbeaten on 71 at the close of play as England reached 341 for five . Bell and Root lifted England's run rate and got them out of a hole having fallen to 34 for three . Gary Ballance has got this big backwards movement so to get him driving, and dismissing him the way the West Indies did, represented a sucker punch.\u00a0Then you looked at the way Ian Bell and Joe Root went about their business and they were just that bit busier. You can't bowl one way to them to dry up their scoring shots because they both drive and they both pull well. Thanks to those two and Ben Stokes, this turned out to be very much England's day. I was delighted that Stokes batted so well on his return to the side. He made no excuses when he was left out of the side and said he deserved to be dropped. I like that, and I like a player like him coming in at No 6 and taking the game away from the opposition. Alastair Cook is bowled through the gate by Kemar Roach for 11 on the first morning in Antigua . Jonathan Trott's first Test in 18 months ended in a third-ball duck as he was dismissed in the first over . Peter Moores and Cook are both genuinely good guys trying to do a good job, so when I received a text from Moores asking if I would have a motivational talk with the team on the eve of the Test I was happy to oblige. I have always said that if England ever want any input from me I will try to help. It's difficult to do that at times, being on the other side of the fence now with the media, but my heart is in English cricket and I want England to do well. It was only a 15-minute chat at the end of England's team meeting and, while not going into it too deeply, I just tried to give the team a sense of perspective. Gary Ballance was third to go for England on the first morning  as he was dismissed by Jason Holder . It's difficult at times when you are in the bubble to remember what it means to be an England cricketer and I tried to emphasise that it is important, but you have to try to play down in your mind quite how important it is and enjoy the journey. And when England were 34 for three, I was receiving a lot of comments in the commentary box about my supposed motivational skills! I replied that I only actually spoke to the England middle order.\n"]}

{"question_id": 424, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Settling down to a glass of wine and a naughty snack is the ultimate after work treat for many of us. But which tipple is the best to bring out the flavour in fiery wasabi peas or salty sausage rolls? Wine experts have created a guide to matching wine with snacks that recommends pairing Pinot Grigio with nachos and Shiraz Rose with salt and vinegar crisps. A Riesling is the perfect companion to a sausage roll, Chardonnay goes great with wasabi peas or pittas and hummus, and Merlot is the best glass to compliment a box of chocolates. Tasters at Jacob's Creek sampled different types of wine with 10 of the nation's most popular snacks and light bites. They even found that different wines match different pizza toppings - with Shiraz best for a margherita but a meaty Cabernet Sauvignon with a pepperoni. Meanwhile, Sauvignon Blanc was found to be the perfect pairing for salted popcorn and a Scotch Egg goes down a treat with a drop of Fiano. TV cook and author, Jo Pratt, who took part in the tasting session with Jacob's Creek wine maker Rebekah Richardson, said: 'There are plenty of guidelines out there about the best wines to drink with main meals but there isn't really any inspiration for which wines to enjoy with smaller plates or snacks. 'So it's brilliant to know you can now enjoy a delicious wine that perfectly complements the flavours of whatever you're eating. 'Whether that's a Sunday roast with all the family, or a well-deserved treat just for you, and wasabi peas and Chardonnay was a real eye opener.' In order to decide on the perfect pairings, 11 types of wine were tried with each of the different foods, with Jo and Rebekah smelling and tasting the food and the drink before pairing them up from a total of 110 possible combinations. The next time you order a cheese and tomato pizza, opt for a spicy Shiraz as its spicy fruit flavours can stand up to the strong aromatic herbs, tangy tomato sauce and salty cheese . They found sausage rolls are paired perfectly with the Riesling due to the 'buttery pastry and rich pork balancing the lime and green apple flavours of the wine'. For pizza, the toppings make a difference to the choice of wine, with a Margherita matched with Shiraz, thanks to its 'spicy fruit flavours standing up well' to the herbs, tomato sauce and cheese topping. But if you opt for a pepperoni pizza, you should serve it with a Cabernet Sauvignon thanks to the 'meaty wine going great with the aniseed kick of the pepperoni'. Chardonnay works with wasabi peas due to the 'creaminess of the wine taking the heat out of the horseradish' with toasted pittas and hummus going nicely with the same wine because of the 'peach and melon notes complimenting the nutty flavours of the chickpeas'. For Scotch eggs, a Fiano complimented the flavours well and for salt and vinegar crisps, a Shiraz Rose was found to be the best match. Experts at the Australian winery put together the new wine matching guide after a survey of 2,000 adults revealed 57 per cent are regularly replacing evening weekday meals with snacks, such as pizza, nachos and pittas and dips. And more than half said they would like to know more about the wines that go with the foods they regularly eat. Seventy-one per cent also admitted they felt there is too much snobbery associated with wine selection. Jacob's Creeks' Rebekah Richardson added: 'Whatever the dish you're cooking, wherever you are in the world, it's not hard to find a recommendation for the best wine to pair it with. 'We're passionate about making quality wines that are great for sharing with good friends and family, and we wanted to celebrate those authentic moments when people are together enjoying a glass of wine with a snack as well. 'This guide helps people make the most of that time, with a glass of wine that tastes amazing with their favourite treat. 'Britons told us they wanted to know about the best wines to go with snacks like wasabi peas, popcorn and chocolate as well as old favourites like pizza. 'And, this new take on wine pairings is the perfect solution.' Margherita Pizza . Wine match: Shiraz . Why it works:\u00a0Spicy fruit flavours with plum and pepper can stand up to the strong aromatic herbs, tangy tomato sauce and salty cheese that makes a perfect Margherita pizza . Pepperoni Pizza . Wine match: Cabernet Sauvignon . Why it works: The cabernet sauvignon, rich in blackcurrent and plum, is a meaty wine great with the aniseed spice kick of the pepperoni. The hint of oak provides a dryness that helps balance out the richness of the cheese and oil from the sausage. Sausage Roll . Wine match: Riesling . Why it works:\u00a0The butteriness in the pastry and the richness of the pork is great with the slight acid from lime and green apple in the Riseling. Nachos with guacamole, sour cream and salsa . Wine match: Pinot Grigio . Why it works:\u00a0From the tangy kick from the salsa to the creaminess of sour cream there's a lot going on in a plate of nachos so Pinot Grigio is a subtle wine which can get along with a mix of flavours. Toasted pitta and hummus . Wine match: Chardonnay . Why it works: Fruit flavours of peach and melon, coupled with a subtle touch of oak flavours complements the nutty nature of the chickpeas. Sea salt and balsamic vinegar crisps . Wine match: Shiraz Rose . Why it works: The fresh raspberry and cherry flavours and the hints of spice in the wine work well with the sharpness of the vinegar . Wasabi peas . Wine match: Chardonnay . Why it works: The creaminess of the wine takes the heat out of the horseradish in the peas. Chocolate . Wine match: Merlot . Why it works: The softness of the tannins and slight sweet fruit in the back matches really nicely with rich chocolate . Salted Popcorn . Wine match: Sauvignon Blanc . Why it works: The slightly herbaceous, grassy flavours of the sauv blanc match the salty flavours of the pork scratchings . Gourmet Scotch egg . Wine match: Fiano . Why it works: The fresh flavours of lemongrass and apricot balance well with the hearty and meaty texture of the Scotch egg .\n"]}

The striker has scored 31 times for MK Dons and Wolves - just one ahead of Tottenham hotshot Kane. Afobe bagged 19 goals on loan at MK Dons before January - including two in their 4-0 League Cup win over Manchester United - and has added 12 more since joining Wolves from Arsenal on a permanent deal. Benik Afobe says he feels 'unstoppable' at the moment as he aims to become the country's top scorer . The Molineux hitman is expected to make his 50th appearance of the season at Wigan on Saturday and after his breakthrough campaign Afobe's confidence is sky high. 'I had self belief but when you play week in, week out you're going to get more confidence - it's a different type of confidence - it's one to know you're unstoppable,' he told Press Association Sport. 'At the moment we do analysis on the other team, the defenders, the keeper, and you hear this player was playing in the Premier League and has experience but I don't care at all, not one bit. 'It doesn't matter what league I'm playing in I'm going to score. 'It's the mentality you've got to change to be a top goalscorer and I've realised that. The former Arsenal man since been in top form since joining Wolves on a permanent transfer . 'All the top goalscorers who score week in, week out like (Lionel) Messi and (Sergio) Aguero, they believe they are going to score before they've had a chance and that's the only difference between a top goalscorer and an average striker.' Wolves have two games left in the Sky Bet Championship and are three points outside the play-offs after Afobe's goal rescued a 1-1 draw with Ipswich on Saturday. Kane has five matches left in the Barclays Premier League with Spurs but Afobe is focused on scoring himself and is not jealous of Kane's success after he dropped out of the top flight for regular football. Harry Kane has been in red hot form this season and scored the third away to Newcastle on Sunday . 'He has five games and I have two,' said the confident but grounded 22-year-old. 'I have played with a lot of these players Harry, Ross Barkley and Jack Wilshere who's my friend, but everyone has their own destiny. 'I have never looked at one player and thought 'that could have been me'. I think that's another reason why I'm doing well. 'I never compare myself to any player. The way people don't succeed in life is that they worry about other people too much. 'I wanted 30 goals. I got to 30 and now I want to keep scoring, I want to get to 35. People have asked 'what's my favourite goal?' I always say 'the next one'.' Afobe scored a double against Manchester United in the Capital One Cup while on loan at MK Dons .\n"]}

Scroll down for video . 'Lack of discipline': Some of the 2,500 police officers who were involved in tracking down the Boston Marathon bombers showed a lack of 'weapons discipline' during two firefights with the brothers, a new report reveals . Brothers: In the first standoff, the officers fired 'toward the vicinity' of Tamerlan (left) and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (right) 'without necessarily having identified and lined up their target', the 130-page document states . Official report: They also reportedly failed to appropriately aim their guns. Amid their chaotic shooting, transit cop Richard Donohue was critically wounded. Above, the After Action Report, which was released on Friday . The unmarked black pickup truck had been 'erroneously reported as stolen'. It was 'spotted driving on Adams Street, near the scene of the shootout, and fired upon by an officer,' the report states. Upon closer inspection, the officer discovered that the occupants of the vehicle were a Boston Police Department officer and a Massachusetts State Police trooper in plain clothing, the document says. Fortunately, both officers were unhurt. Then, later in the night,\u00a0when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat, an officer 'fired his weapon without appropriate authority,' causing others to believe the bomber was shooting at them. This caused 'many officers to fire at the boat in the belief they were being shot by the suspect,' says the long-awaited report by the Massachusetts Emergency Management Agency, released Friday. The two standoffs and the car incident all created 'dangerous crossfire situations'. But despite the findings, the report praises many\u00a0other aspects of the emergency response to the April 15 attacks. Firefight: Shortly after the firefight (pictured) in Watertown, Massachusetts, on April 19, 2013 - which resulted in the death of Tamerlan Tsarnaev - an officer mistakenly fired on a police vehicle carrying two other cops . Suspect: Then, later in the night, when Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found hiding in a boat, an officer 'fired his weapon without appropriate authority,' causing others to believe the bomber was shooting at them. Above,\u00a0Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is pictured clutching his chest after emerging from the boat he was hiding in . Timeline: This graphic, featured in the report, details the timing of the two bombs and the following incidents . The document\u00a0particularly highlights the response of medical personnel at the scene and Boston hospitals who treated injured bombing victims, 16 of whom suffered 'traumatic amputations'. 'The hospitals that received patients rendered life-saving medical care; as a result, every patient that was transported to a hospital from the scene survived,' the report states. 'Overall, the response to the Boston Marathon bombings must be considered a great success.' Best practices . Areas in need of improvement . Krystle Campbell, 29, Martin Richard, eight, and Lingzi Lu, 23, were killed after the Tsarnaev brothers placed two pressure cooker bombs, hidden in backpacks, at the marathon finish line. A further 264 people were wounded in the worst attack on US soil since the 9/11 terrorist atrocity. The new report starts by explaining how April 15 was 'the perfect day for running'. The 'air was cool', the 'sun was shining', and the logistics supporting the marathon were 'operating smoothly', it says. But at 2.49pm, however, 'the race was forever changed', it adds. The first of the brothers' two IEDs detonated at 671\u00a0Boylston Street. Thirteen seconds later, 180 yards up, the second exploded. While victims were rushed to hospital, authorities immediately cordoned off a 15-block crime scene area, the report says. A large number of abandoned bags and packages were also screened. The document praises the actions of law enforcement in reacting to 61 reports of suspicious packages in the hours after the bombings - and hundreds more reports in following days. But it notes that many victims in hospital\u00a0found 'the large numbers of heavily armed police officers and investigators' who were providing security in the building 'to be intimidating'. The patients were left 'frightened' after the officers questioned their families and friends, and collected their cell phones and other evidence, the document states. Explosion: Krystle Campbell, 29, Martin Richard, eight, and Lingzi Lu, 23, were killed after the Tsarnaev brothers placed two pressure cooker bombs, hidden in backpacks, at the marathon finish line (pictured) 'Lack of coordination': The report reveals that there was a lack of coordination and management of hundreds of police officers who converged on a staging area at a local shopping mall in the hours after the shootout . Criticism: It also states that the two shootouts and the car incident created 'dangerous crossfire situations' In relation to the first shootout with the suspects in Watertown, the report explains how the standoff followed the fatal shooting of Sean Collier, a MIT police officer, and a carjacking in Cambridge. During the\u00a0incident, officers lined both sides of a narrow residential street and began firing at Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as he fled the scene, resulting in a 'dangerous crossfire situation'. 'Weapons discipline was lacking by the multitude of law enforcement officers in the field during... the firefight with the two suspects near Dexter and Laurel Streets,' the report states of the shootout. 'Although initial responding officers practiced appropriate weapons discipline while they were engaged in the firefight with the suspects, additional officers arriving on scene near the conclusion of the firefight fired weapons toward the vicinity of the suspects, without necessarily having identified and lined up their target,' or appropriately aiming their guns. 'Officers lining both sides of the street also fired upon the second suspect as he fled the scene in a vehicle.' A timeline of events in the report notes Donohue was shot as the surviving suspect fled. Chilling: Little Martin, who was killed in the bombings, is seen (front circle) just meters away from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (back circle) on April 15. Seconds later, one of two bombs exploded, piercing his body with shrapnel . Victims: Martin (left) was cheering on runners with his family. Right, Lingzi Lu (right) also died in the bombings . The report does not name any of the officers involved in the April 19 incident. More than a dozen officers suffered minor injuries during the deadly shootout, which followed a four-day manhunt. Although officials had deliberated whether to release photos of the suspects at the time, 'weighing concerns about the suspects fleeing and the general safety of the public', they ultimately did so. Donohue only survived after his colleagues at the scene tended to 'slow the bleeding with pressure and a tourniquet', says the report, congratulating the other officers on their life-saving efforts. He was then rushed to hospital, where had to be resuscitated, before eventually recovering. The report shows that initial responding Watertown police officers failed to remove their patrol rifles from the secure mount in their vehicles because the rifles were 'rarely used and securely locked'. It also reveals that there was a lack of coordination and management of hundreds of police officers who converged on a staging area at a local shopping mall in the hours after the shootout. Labels: This picture, featured in the report, shows the labels that were placed on victims after the bombings . On trial: Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (seen in a sketch on March 5), who was arrested after stepping out of the boat in which he had been hiding on April 19, is on trial on federal charges relating to the bombing and its aftermath . Many of these cops had 'self-deployed,' the 'After Action Report' states. The chaos was blamed on the lack of a 'single, integrated, comprehensive operational plan for all public safety organizations'. And it notes that Massachusetts Army National Guard soldiers deployed to help police in their efforts to track down the suspects were unarmed due to 'policy of the Commonwealth and the MANG'. This left them reliant on police, 'increasing the risk to both soldiers and officers', the report says. However, the document praises the efforts of the EMS system and officials'\u00a0successful\u00a0coordination. 'This\u00a0coordination resulted in no one single hospital in the area being overwhelmed,' it says. On Friday,\u00a0Boston Mayor Martin Walsh told NBC in a statement  that he was proud of the elements that the report praised and that the city would learn from the areas highlighted for improvement. 'I know that over the past two years city departments have worked together diligently to take the lessons learned from the bombings and drastically improve our emergency response protocols so we are even better prepared for the future, and we can set the example for other cities,' he said. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was arrested after stepping out of the boat under which he had been hiding on April 19, is on trial on federal charges relating to the bombing and its aftermath. Some of the charges could carry the death penalty. His lawyer admitted in opening statements that he had participated in the bombings but argued that his late brother was the mastermind. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed earlier that night during the initial shootout with police after he was ran over by an SUV, apparently driven by his brother. He had also been shot multiple times . Closing arguments for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's case are scheduled for Monday in US District Court.\n"]}

{"question_id": 429, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Peter Lawwell recently admitted to telling Ronny Deila that it was a matter of getting over the \u2018Le Guen hump\u2019 but Celtic\u2019s chief executive might well have cited a couple of names that had met their grim fates closer to home. One thing is for sure: Deila did not need to be an ardent student of the history of Scottish football to appreciate the gravitas of the situation he had become immersed in earlier this season. By late autumn, his side had twice exited Europe while Hamilton Accies had left Celtic Park triumphant. A search party was hardly required to identify his doubters. Celtic manager\u00a0Ronny Deila admitted that the first six months in charge were mentally tough . Publicly, Deila plastered on the brave face and talked of looking behind the results for progress. Privately, the misgivings about his long-term suitability for the post were beginning to gnaw at him. \u2018We played Dundee away (1-1) and we couldn\u2019t play worse than we did,\u2019 Deila recalled. \u2018It was unbelievably bad. You know what the players want but you just haven\u2019t got the message across. \u2018People are insecure and that\u2019s a hard time for the coach and the players.\u2019 Even for a manager who had been steeped in the nuances of Scottish football, such a period would have been troubling enough. Deila, a Norwegian who had cut his teeth at tiny Stromsgodset, began to look like a man caught in entirely the wrong movie. \u2018I have to admit the first six months were tough mentally because you have to really learn a lot of new things and get settled,\u2019 he went on. \u2018One thing is the language, the culture is another and then you have to know new opponents, your own team, understand what Celtic is all about and Scottish football. \u2018There are so many things to take in and it\u2019s so easy to push too hard and then you don\u2019t get any time for reflection and you just get tired and then you can meet hard games and hard periods. You have nothing to push against.\u2019 The Norwegian was unsure whether he was cut out to be the boss of the Bhoys . Upon his unveiling last summer, Deila was asked if he felt ready to manage a club like Celtic. He could hardly have answered in anything other than the affirmative. However, faced with a dressing room full of strangers, a league and a country he knew little about and the small matter of Champions League qualifiers hurtling towards him, he quickly appreciated the scale of the task he faced. \u2018I spoke English at once,\u2019 he recalled. \u2018I\u2019d a one-hour speech to them (the players) about how I wanted things. I think that went quite well. \u2018But I didn\u2019t know anything about Scottish football. I didn\u2019t know anything about the players. I\u2019d had a full season with my old club and five days later I was ready for Celtic. \u2018I didn\u2019t know more than four names in the squad so it takes time to get to know them then bang, you\u2019re in the Champions League and playing games all over Europe, so I was in a situation I had to manage. \u2018The players really wanted it. No problem at all. But my way of playing is quite difficult, it\u2019s a lot of things. It\u2019s not straightforward, a lot of relations and rules that we have to get into the players. \u2018That takes time to get into. It\u2019s so important to understand if you go back to the big managers they had before, Neil (Lennon) and (Gordon) Strachan and Martin (O\u2019Neill), they also struggled in the beginning. It wasn\u2019t only me. Peter was saying that the whole time - relax, you\u2019re not the first, we\u2019ve been through this before. But it\u2019s harder for a Norwegian guy coming in, who\u2019s unknown, as opposed to someone coming in with a big name.\u2019 He was not alone in those difficult days, however. Realising the need to have individuals familiar with the club\u2019s DNA standing beside him, John Collins was suggested as an assistant. Stevie Woods, the goalkeeping coach under Lennon, was retained while John Kennedy, the former youth coach, was promoted. Collectively, they acted as Deila\u2019s support network. \u2018I had unbelievably good back up from Peter, John Collins, John Kennedy and Stevie Woods as well,\u2019 Deila explained. But results have picked up and they lead the Premiership (Kris Commons pictured scoring at St Mirren) \u2018I\u2019m a very open person, I say it as it is and I do that with them as well. My staff has been very good and helped me a lot. We\u2019re growing more together, I\u2019ve learned from them, they\u2019ve learned from me and hopefully we know where we want to go. That\u2019s fun and that gives you energy. That\u2019s why I love to be here.\u2019 It\u2019s the small things that are making his life a little easier. In the 10 months he has been in Scotland, language has become less of an issue. \u2018The first three weeks, trying to listen to what people were saying for five hours... when I got home, I was totally gone,\u2019 he admitted. \u2018I was so tired because I was sitting there all the time thinking \u201cwhat is he really saying?\u201d. There were so many new things. \u2018Broony is one of the hardest. He is so quick. Half the time I just try to laugh at the right moments! But I am getting to understand more. A blip against St Johnstone aside, Celtic have been imperious since the turn of the year . \u2018Now I feel more comfortable with the vocabulary, I feel I can express myself better. Before it was always the same words I was using. But I\u2019m looking forward to speaking like every Scot!\u2019 Ahead of Wednesday's game with Partick Thistle, Deila, his players and the supporters are very much now on the same page. A blip against St Johnstone aside, Celtic have been imperious since the turn of the year. From privately wondering if he\u2019d bitten off more than he could chew by coming to Celtic, Deila is now ravenous for more success. \u2018It\u2019s fun,\u2019 he said. \u2018I want to win more trophies. I feel good. I\u2019ve managed now to enjoy the week better in the past when everything in management was new and stressful. \u2018Mentally, I\u2019m in a very good place which is why I\u2019m saying I\u2019m enjoying the moments right now and looking forward to the games. \u2018We have built the foundation and now the fun part is starting - to build relationships into the team and get the systems even better and quicker.\u2019\n"]}

The 29-year-old England seamer is back in Test contention in the Caribbean after his comeback last summer was cut short by injury. He managed 18 wickets in four Tests prior to that, playing a big part for an England side often criticised for going easy on the speed gun. Liam Plunkett wants to use his pace to lead England to victory in the Test series against West Indies . Plunkett returned to the England fold last summer in Test series against Sri Lanka and India . Plunkett has recovered from a minor ankle complaint in Yorkshire's pre-season trip to Abu Dhabi . A minor ankle complaint during Yorkshire's pre-season trip to Abu Dhabi proved to be nothing more than a brief setback and he is now looking to make a name for himself in a part of the world that is famous for its quick men. 'I'm trying to be the fastest (bowler on the pitch). I train hard at it and I feel that's why I stand out from the rest,' he said ahead of Monday's two-day warm-up against a St Kitts & Nevis Invitation XI.

With James Anderson and Stuart Broad likely to retain new ball duties for the first Test in Antigua on April 13, Plunkett is fighting for a place with Barbados-born Chris Jordan and the uncapped Mark Wood. There is a case to be made for both his rivals, Jordan being more familiar with conditions in his homeland and Wood an unknown quantity to the opposition, but Plunkett relishes the scrap. 'It's a good unit, a good bunch of lads and we're all working hard. There's massive competition,' he said.

The Chancellor appeared to leave the door open when asked if he would be \u2018depriving more families\u2019 of the payments which are worth more than \u00a31,000 per year. More than a million households lost out when the Coalition announced that families with one parent earning \u00a350,000 would pay tax on child benefit. Earners over \u00a360,000 lost out altogether. Scroll down for video . Chancellor George Osborne, pictured visiting the Red Cone Cafe in Stourbridge, refused to rule out further cuts to child benefit if the Conservatives win a second term . The controversial measure, brought in two and a half years ago as part of the Government\u2019s austerity programme, was criticised for penalising single-earner families and stay-at-home mothers. It meant anyone earning less than \u00a350,000 \u2013 even a couple on \u00a349,000 each - still received the full entitlement of \u00a320.70 a week for the first child, and \u00a313.70 for every subsequent child. Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could \u2018rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you\u2019ve already done in this Parliament?\u2019 The Conservatives say they would cut \u00a330billion of spending if they win a second term. Of this \u00a312billion would be slashed from the welfare bill, with the rest from government departments and further cracking down on tax avoidance. While the Prime Minister has given a commitment to protect the state pension, few other savings have been set out apart from reducing the cap on a family\u2019s annual benefits from \u00a326,000 to \u00a323,000. Mr Osborne did not directly answer about reducing the threshold, only saying that child benefit would not be replaced by the new benefits system Universal Credit, which is being rolled out nationally. The respected think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies have suggested that increasing Universal Credit for some families and using it instead of child benefit could save \u00a34.8billion a year. The Chancellor said: \u2018You can judge us on our record in this Parliament. If we wanted to put child benefit into Universal Credit we would have done it when we set up Universal Credit. \u2018We\u2019ve got a track record, we\u2019ve got a plan based on clear principles of making work pay, sharpening work incentives.\u2019 Asked again why he did not rule out any type of child benefit cuts, he said: \u2018I\u2019ve given you a very clear answer.\u00a0We\u2019ve created a welfare system where child poverty is down, inequality is down, we have a record low number of workless households and what we are doing is creating welfare system where it pays to work and we protect the most vulnerable. \u2018We are going to carry on doing that in the next Parliament. But we can\u2019t do any of these things without economic security and a growing economy.\u2019 Mr Osborne was asked at a briefing in central London on the economy this morning whether he could \u2018rule out depriving more people of child benefit, like you\u2019ve already done in this Parliament?' The Chancellor said the Coalition had saved \u00a321billion in this Parliament, and the \u2018same principles\u2019 would apply if his party win a second term \u2013 with further reforms to welfare . The Chancellor said the Coalition had saved \u00a321billion in this Parliament, and the \u2018same principles\u2019 would apply if his party win a second term \u2013 with further reforms to welfare. \u2018This is perfectly achievable and anyone who thinks that the job of reforming welfare has somehow been completed, I think, is mistaken. \u2018We want to go on creating a welfare system which rewards work and the aspirations of families and protect the most vulnerable\u2019, he said. It is widely speculated that the Conservatives could restrict child benefit to just two children, to save around \u00a32billion a year. Work and Pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith is sympathetic to the idea. He recently said it was \u2018well worth looking at\u2019 and could save \u2018significant money\u2019 and help with \u2018behaviour change\u2019 by forcing couples to think carefully about whether they could afford to have another child. It was not seriously considered in this Parliament due to opposition from the Liberal Democrats and David Cameron appeared to reject it last year amid concerns it would alienate low-income families. The event attended by Mr Osborne, and Treasury minister David Gauke and Priti Patel was an analysis of the Labour\u2019s party fiscal plans, if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street. He claimed the Labour party would \u2018never\u2019 eliminate the budget deficit \u2013 unlike Tory plans to run a surplus by 2020 \u2013 because they would borrow billions of pounds every year and not cut spending. \u2018When the economy's growing, and we're not in recession, we should be raising more than we spend\u2019, he said. \u2018That's the way, proven around the world, to bear down on your national debt and best prepare yourself for any future economic storms. Fixing the roof while the sun is shining. \u2018The Labour Party don't want to do that, they only talked about balancing the current, day to day, spending while continuing to borrow to pay for capital spending. What they don't tell you is that means a permanent, never-ending budget deficit.\u2019 Labour\u2019s shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Chris Leslie said Mr Osborne had put middle income families in the firing line. He said: \u2018The Tories won't admit where their \u00a312 billion of welfare cuts will come from, but after this press conference it's now clear middle income families are in the firing line. \u2018George Osborne repeatedly refused to rule out rolling child benefit into universal credit. This would mean 4.3 million families losing over \u00a31,000 a year, according to the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies.\u2019 An aide to Mr Osborne played down suggestions the Conservatives were planning changes to child benefit. \ufffd4a, .\n"]}

Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees of the fast food chain began to protest. Scroll down for video . Single mother Adriana Alvarez, 22,\u00a0has revealed what it's really like to live on McDonald's wages, where she makes only $10.50 an hour and can only afford to sleep in a moldy basement in Chicago . Alvarez (pictured with her three-year-old son Manny) says that even with assistance from food stamps, Medicaid, and a child care subsidy, she is barely getting by, despite having word for McDonald's for five years . The mother revealed in a column for Refinery29 that the first thing she would do with an increased wage would be to find a 'decent place to live' with good schools for her three-year-old son Manny. 'When it rains, water steeps into the apartment,' Alvarez writes of her basement home, the only place she said she can afford. 'This wetness brings mold, and I can't get rid of the smell.\u00a0We can\u2019t even leave anything on the floor... toys or anything else on the floor may get ruined when the water comes in.' Alvarez said that, after paying for 'child care, transportation to work, food, rent, and our other basic expenses,' she can never afford to give anything else to her son. 'Every time I think about taking Manny somewhere fun, like to a movie, I have to think about whether we can really afford the gas,' she writes. The mother said even providing the specific milk her son, who drinks 'a half-gallon every two days', requires because of his lactose intolerance can be a struggle. Since it's a more expensive brand, it uses up most of the $80 Alvarez is allotted in food stamps, she told the New York Times. Alvarez said her situation is not unique. She said that most of her co-workers are 'in the same boat', forced to rely on government assistance 'no matter how long they've held their jobs'. According to one study cited in\u00a0Business Insider, half of the nation's fast food workers require some kind of government assistance, costing taxpayers $7billion a year. Alvarez is a leader with Fight For $15, an international movement to raise minimum wage laws and acquire the right to unionize. She said her pay used to be even lower before she and fellow employees began protesting . Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand the $15 an hour wage . And $1.2billion of that public assistance goes to employees of McDonald's annually, reported a study released by the National Employment Law Project. Just weeks ago, McDonald's announced that it would be giving a $1 pay raise for about 90,000 employees, effectively making their wage $10 an hour. But the raise only applies to employees who work in restaurants owned by the corporation. Restaurants operated by independent franchise workers were\u00a0ineligible\u00a0for the wage bump, which Alvarez said disqualifies nine out of 10 McDonald's employees. And, even for those who do get an increased wage, Alvarez argues that the number would 'hardly going to lift any working family out of poverty'. And higher wages aren't all Alvarez and her co-workers are fighting for. She said\u00a0Fight For $15 is also protesting for the ability to form a union 'without interference from management'. A group of protesters in New York stage a die-in as part of a day of rallies and protests by fast-food workers known as 'Fight for $15 on April 15' Fight For $15 (pictured protesting on Wednesday) started two years ago in New York, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving . Alvarez writes that she needs a union to help negotiate sick days, which she said she is currently not provided with, costing her a day's worth of wages when she has to stay home if her son is ill. Fight For $15 started two years ago in New York City, when hundreds of fast food workers went on strike the day after Thanksgiving. The movement staged rallies across the country yesterday in honor of 'Fight for $15 on April 15'. Last year more than 100 McDonald's employees, including Alvarez, who were part of Fight For $15 were arrested after they protested a McDonald's shareholder meeting to demand a wage raise. There has been some change. Seattle and San Francisco have raised the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and a ballot campaign began in Washington, D.C. this week to initiate the same change. But Alvarez hope she will get to see change in her own life soon. 'It doesn't seem right that people who work with children or who serve food aren't paid enough to support their own kids or put food on their own table,' she writes. 'We want our families to be able to look forward to a better future.' There has been some change.

Germans no longer see the Second World War as a defeat\u00a0and now think of themselves as victims of the Nazis, it has been claimed.

Research carried out by the Forsa Institute found the number of people who considered the end of the conflict a defeat fell to just nine per cent - a 25 per cent drop in the last decade. Instead, they now exploring the impact of Hitler and the Nazi regime on everyday Germans, the Times reported. The findings have been published exactly 70 years after Hitler committed suicide in a bunker in Berlin. Author Florian Huber has sold tens of thousand of copies of his book, Child Promise Me You Will Shoot Yourself, which examines the number of German suicides after peace was declared. 'German journalists are interested in my book, but they keep asking me whether I am doing something to make Germans out as victims, which is not allowed, it seems,' he reportedly told the newspaper. 'We have to think of ourselves as the bad guys, and it is still a controversial thing to suggest otherwise.' Crimes committed against ordinary Germans by the Allies and the millions that were left uprooted by war are also the subject of other tomes. The German city of Munich is today opening a new museum dedicated to exploring its past as the birthplace of the Nazi movement. The Munich Documentation Center for the History of National Socialism charts the rise of the Nazi party from its founding in the Bavarian capital in 1920, a year before Adolf Hitler became its leader. German Culture Minister Monika Gruetters praised the city for tackling what she called 'the long repressed confrontation with the special role Munich played.' Gruetters noted that Germany's effort to examine its past - which encompassed World War II and the murder of millions the Nazis considered unworthy of life - is getting harder by the year because the number of witnesses is dwindling. Only nine per cent of Germans now consider the end of the conflict a defeat. Pictured:Operation Overlord in June 1944 .\n"]}

The 26-year-old Argentinian returned to the Stadium of Light on a season-long loan deal from Costa Rican side Sport Uruguay de Coronado in August last year and has made 35 appearances to date this season. The last of them was a start in Sunday's 1-0 derby victory over Newcastle which provided a huge boost to the club's top-flight survival hopes. Santiago Vergini (left) is keen to stay at Sunderland having played a key role in the Wearside outfit's 1-0 derby win over Newcastle United on Sunday. Above, the Sunderland defender battles with Ayoze Perez for the ball . Vergini celebrates with team-mate Costel Pantilimon at the full-time whistle following the Wear-Tyne derby win . A successful completion of new head coach Dick Advocaat's mission to keep the Black Cats in the Premier League could have significant consequences for Vergini, and he is open to what might come his way. He told the Sunderland Echo: 'In the contract, it is written that if we stay in the Premier League, I can stay here for another two years. I feel very comfortable here, both at the club and outside the club, so I would be very keen to stay. 'The only downside is the climate and the weather, but even that has been good for the last few days! 'It has been very good to play regularly [this season] and I am very happy. I think with time, I have been able to adapt more to the style of play and also to my team-mates. Vergini helped Sunderland keep a clean sheet in the derby win as he makes a slide tackle on Perez . Sunderland initially signed Vergini on loan in January 2014, with the defender making his debut in an FA Cup fourth round clash with Kidderminster where he makes an attempt to tackle Jack Bryne . 'Apart from the struggles we are going through in the league, I have felt very comfortable.' Victory over the Magpies - their first in nine games in all competitions - eased Sunderland into 15th place and three points clear of the relegation zone. However, that could count for little if Advocaat's men fail to build upon it when Crystal Palace head north on Saturday. Vergini said: 'Every win brings with it a lot of confidence and with a derby game, that is even more the case. In our next game, we need to show the same character and the same spirit as we did on Sunday.'\n"]}

Hadi still claims he's Yemen's legitimate leader and is working with the Saudis and other allies to return to his country. Since mid-March, more than 700 people have been killed in violence that shows no sign of slowing, according to figures from the World Health Organization. The Houthis say they have the support of the country's people behind them. \"It's the right of the Yemeni people to stand against the attacks in all possible means as long as the attacks continue,\" Al-Houthi said Sunday. \"After our people move and react against the attacks and killing of children and women, we do not want to hear any voices and cries.\" But there are signs of some fracturing among forces loyal to former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh, many of whom have fought alongside the rebels. Gen. AbdulRahman AlHalili, who leads more than 10,000 troops, has now allied himself with Hadi, military sources said Sunday. Meanwhile, Saudi Brig. Gen.

But now another astonishing but little-known chapter of his war career is to be told in a Hollywood film being dubbed \u2018The First Great Escape\u2019. Bader \u2013 who lost his legs in a flying accident in 1931 \u2013 was shot down over France in August 1941 and ended up in a German prison camp in Warburg. It was there that the officer, who always made light of his disability and refused to even use a stick, was involved in a mass break-out that pre-dated the break in 1944 immortalised in The Great Escape starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough. Bader\u2019s life story has already been the subject of the successful film Reach for the Sky in 1956 starring Kenneth More. This latest look at his exploits is based on a book on the Warburg escape by historian Mark Felton called Zero Night. It was a plot hatched by Scottish lieutenant Jock Hamilton-Baillie, 23, and involved build folding ladders to escape over the wire. Major Tom Stallard, of the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. The fighter ace went on to describe it as \u2018the most brilliant escape conception of this war\u2019. The ladders were made from wood from a wrecked hut and crafted in the camp\u2019s music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. They were disguised as bookshelves. On the night of the break \u2013 August 30, 1942 \u2013 the prisoners managed to fuse the camp\u2019s search lights and 41 men carrying four 12ft scaling ladders rushed the fence. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the wire, of which three made a \u2018home run\u2019 back to freedom. The Great Escape: Bader's story predates the break in 1944 immortalised in the film starring Steve McQueen and Richard Attenborough (pictured) Bader was among those recaptured but was such a nuisance to the Germans that he ended up in the \u2018escape-proof\u2019 Colditz Castle and remained in captivity until the end of the war. More than 40 Allied prisoners put their lives on the line in a plot to escape from Oflag VI-B camp near Warburg, Germany, in 1942. Major Tom Stallard, a larger than life 37-year-old from Somerset captured while serving in the Durham Light Infantry, teamed up with Bader on the planning. While the Great Escape relied on its famous tunnels, the Warburg mass break out saw the men boldly leap over the huge perimeter fences using wooden ladders. Bader described what happened as 'the most brilliant escape conception of this war'. Months of meticulous planning and secret training went into the three minute charge of the camp's double perimeter fences. Bader\u2019s life story has been the subject of 1956 film Reach for the Sky starring Kenneth More (pictured) A series of makeshift ladders propped against the prison camp's perimeter fence were made from wood plundered from a wrecked hut. They were crafted in the camp's music room, where the sawing and hammering was drowned out by the sound of instruments. The escape was codenamed Operation Olympian because it involved troops from across the Commonwealth - Britain, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book (pictured) have been bought by production firm Essential 11 USA . As the night of the breakout loomed, the ladders were disguised as bookshelves to fool the guards. After the prisoners fused the perimeter search lights, 41 of them carrying four 12-foot scaling ladders made from bed slats rushed to the barbed-wire fence and clambered over. One ladder collapsed, so only 28 made it over the barbed wire, of which three made a 'home run' back to freedom. Bader later ended up in Colditz and had his tin legs taken away to ensure he remained in captivity until the end of the war. Major Stallard and another leading light of the escape Major Johnnie Cousens, also of the Durham Light Infantry, survived the war and lived into their 70s. Both were too modest to breathe hardly a word about what had happened on August 30 1942. But now their story could trump the Great Escape after Hollywood bosses snapped up the rights to turn military historian Mark Felton's book about the escape Zero Night into a blockbuster. The rights to Dr Felton\u2019s book have been bought by the makers of 2013\u2019s Saving Mr Banks with Tom Hanks. Production firm Essential 11 USA, the makers of the 2013 Tom Hanks and Emma Thompson hit Saving Mr Banks, is now working on a script. Dr Felton said a number of 'A-list' Hollywood stars were queuing up for roles and Essential 11 had invited him to help cast the leads, although he could not reveal who was interested. He said: 'I'm very, very pleased. It's very, very exciting. Essential 11 did a fantastic job with Saving Mr Banks and to have that same team working on this is very pleasing.'\n"]}

A Sikh optician who slit the throat of his daughter-in-law\u2019s father who was in bed after a drunken family row has been jailed for life. Naunihal Singh, 54, woke up great-grandfather Ujjal Singh, 63, and slashed him with a kitchen knife at his son and daughter-in-law\u2019s home. The attack  in Crumpsall, Manchester, came after a heated argument over the couple's lack of children - with  Ujjal accusing Naunihal's son Yawinder-Pal \u2018Monty\u2019, 37, of 'firing blanks'. Today, Naunihal was jailed at Manchester Crown Court for at least 17 years and 39 days after admitting murder. The court was told that at the time of the killing last November, Naunihal and his wife Jaswant, who live in India, were paying a visit to Monty, and their daughter-in-law Balvinder, 42. Also there were Balvinder\u2019s parents Jaginder and Ujjal from Ipswich, Suffolk - and the latter became angry at Monty for the couple\u2019s failure to have children - accusing him of \u2018firing blanks\u2019. After an afternoon in the pub and an evening meal, Ujjal went to bed - but tensions escalated and Monty smashed a photo frame with his hand, which saw relatives take him to hospital. As Ujjal lay in bed, Naunihal sat at the kitchen table drinking vodka before taking a kitchen knife from a drawer. He then went into the bedroom, grabbed Ujjal\u2019s jaw and slit his throat. When the family returned from the hospital and found Ujjal\u2019s blood-soaked body, an ambulance was called where one paramedic noticed Monty move the knife and told police. Monty was soon arrested on suspicion of murder. Great-grandfather: Murder victim Ujjal Singh (front right) with his daughters (back row, from left) Tipta Kaur-Singh, Shakuntla Kaur-Singh, Piaro Kaur-Singh, Sindy Kaur-Singh, and (front left) his son Amolak Singh . Naunihal had already fled with his passport and tickets to fly back to India from Birmingham Airport - and got all the way to the terminal where he asked about changing his flights. It is believed he was then told of Monty's arrest and later handed himself in. Two days after the killing, he walked into a Manchester\u00a0police station, where he said: \u2018My son is innocent, I\u2019m guilty.\u2019 While demonstrating a \u2018slashing\u2019 motion, he added: \u2018I\u2019m guilty, I got the knife and I cut him like this... you let my son go. I love my son.\u2019 Mark Kellet, prosecuting, said: \u2018During the evening, Monty and Balvinder cooked dinner for the family. Monty, the defendant and Ujjal continued to drink. \u2018(That) evening, the atmosphere became more argumentative. They argued about money and the fact that Monty and Balvinder did not have any children, with Ujjal blaming Monty for this. \u2018As the argument developed, the exchanges became heated. Jaswant and Jaginder tried to calm Ujjal down and he was taken to bed. Jaginder went upstairs and put him into his pyjamas. Scene:\u00a0The attack in Crumpsall, Manchester, came after a heated argument over the couple's lack of children . \u2018Monty then smashed a photograph frame and his hand was bleeding. Balvinder, Jaswant and Jaginder took Monty to hospital for treatment on his hand, which was bleeding. 'As Monty and the others left, the defendant said: \"There is going to be a price to pay for the loss of your blood\". The group arrived at the hospital at about 11.10pm and returned home just after 1.10am. When they returned, Jaginder went into the bedroom to check on her husband to find blood around his neck and a knife on his chest.\u00a0Ujjal was pronounced dead in hospital one hour and 20 minutes later. While at the house, paramedic Adam Wain saw Monty move the knife from the bedroom and informed the police, who subsequently arrested him. Naunihal handed himself in to police the following day where he told an officer that the police \u2018had the wrong man\u2019. 'Awful incident': Senior Investigating Officer Bob Tonge (centre) of Greater Manchester Police speaks outside Manchester Crown Court today with Ujjal's family. He said the case is 'tragic from start to finish' In interview, he said he took the knife into the upstairs bedroom where Ujjal was sleeping \u2018to scare him\u2019 because he had been abusive about his son. He later told officers Ujjal was on his back on the bed, staring at him. He told police: \u2018I don\u2019t know what I did. And now when I hear all these things, then I realise that maybe I have killed him. \u2018He was scaring me with his eyes and he was swearing at me so... and he was coming at me and I just did like that and it just happened very quickly... and I was scared and he was bleeding.\u2019 Mr Kellet said: \u2018He stated that he was angry with Ujjal so took a knife from the kitchen to scare him. When he was in the bedroom, he was scared by Ujjal\u2019s eyes. \u2018Ujjal sat up in bed and somehow came into contact with the knife. He said that he panicked because of the blood and left the house. His passport and tickets to fly from Birmingham Airport were coincidentally in his coat pocket.\u2019 Return journey: Naunihal had already fled with his passport and tickets to fly back to India from Birmingham Airport (above) - and got all the way to the terminal where he asked about changing his flights . After the case Senior Investigating Officer Bob Tonge of Greater Manchester Police said: \u2018This case is tragic from start to end and what should have been a normal family gathering ended in absolute tragedy. \u2018Two families have been destroyed by this awful incident, which basically stemmed from a family argument and was fuelled by alcohol. \u2018While alone with the victim, and feeling slighted and offended by comments directed at his son, Naunihal Singh callously went into Ujjal Singh\u2019s room and without a second thought, stabbed him as he slept. \u2018He then fled, leaving his son, daughter-in-law and her family to discover his heinous crime. \u2018The one saving grace is that he has not subjected them to further torment by making them endure a trial and has faced up to his crime and subsequent, inevitable punishment.\u2019 In a statement Ujjal\u2019s family said: \u2018A true testament to his character was his ability to interact with his elders, his peers and also the younger generation that he was surrounded by. \u2018He will be fondly remembered by all his family, he will never be replaced and never be forgotten.\u2019 Ujjal was also described by relatives as a 'well-respected member of the Sikh community', while the court was told that the death had 'rocked the Sikh community in the area'.\n"]}

The rest of the family, from Heysham, near Lancaster, are now waiting on tests which could reveal which of them also have a mutation of the GATA2 gene. The GATA2 gene is important in the production of blood cells, and the disorder means a sufferer's blood count might be low, making them more vulnerable to infection. Alternatively, the blood cells might be abnormal, leading to leukaemia. Rachel Simpson, 15, has a one-in-a-million genetic condition which doctors say will eventually give her cancer if untreated.

As a parent your feel like your insides have been ripped out, you've got to be brave. 'But there's also relief that we know what's wrong so she can deal with it. 'She's been absolutely amazing, we've not had any tears, nothing, she's ever so matter of fact about it, she understands all the consequences, they explained it all, and she's been so mature.' She explained her daughter's diagnosis came after years of illness. 'She's been getting ill for the last two or three years - she kept getting pneumonia and cellulitis; any infection around she just seems to get.' Baffled, doctors ran blood tests - which revealed she had a mutation of the\u00a0GATA2 gene. Mrs Simpson said: 'The rest of us have had our fair share of problems, but no more than anybody else. 'We're just waiting for the tests to come back to see if we have the mutation.' Miss Simpson suffers from a mutation of the GATA2 gene. This is important in the production of blood cells, and the disorder means a sufferer's blood counts might be low, making them more vulnerable to infection.

'But now they but now they can predict it, which is amazing. She added: 'God willing, I want my son Steven to be OK. We've already been told he's not a bone marrow match, so Rachel will need to go on the bone marrow register.' Professor Inderjeet Dokal, of St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, is an expert in Rachel's condition. He said: 'This mutation's frequency is less than one in a million, it's a very rare genetic disorder. 'One member of a family has a 50/50 chance of passing it on, but it can also be the first time in the family that the genetic mutation occurs.

Tottenham's new state-of-the-art stadium is due to be ready in time for the 2018-19 season . Spurs' new 65,000 capacity stadium could be better suited to the NFL than the 90,000-seat Wembley . If Tottenham press ahead with the proposed stadium design and secure the NFL franchise it would represent a significant blow to the FA, who also see the NFL as a potentially lucrative partner for Wembley, their \u00a3757m stadium. But the NFL are keeping their options open at this stage in the knowledge that a new London stadium designed with American football requirements in mind would be hugely advantageous. Even the proposed capacity of 65,000 for the new White Hart Lane is a more realistic target than 90,000 seats which Wembley boasts. Wembley does have the iconic status that the NFL finds attractive but there are other issues with the national stadium. Not least the fact that they have to leave the lowest 5,000 seats empty so that the view of spectators is not restricted by the mass of huge bodies on the touchline. The modern NFL stadiums make sight-lines for spectators a priority and the new White Hart Lane could overcome the problem that is experienced at Wembley by having the artificial pitch at a significantly lower level beneath the moveable grass pitch. Wembley has hosted NFL regular-season matches since the International Series began in 2007 . Detroit Lions' clash with Atlanta Falcons kicked off early, as will all three games at Wembley later this year . Retractable grass pitches are nothing new in modern stadia design. England have played on two: at Gelsenkirchen in Germany during the 2006 World Cup and in the Sapporo Dome in Japan four years earlier. The Gelredome in Holland also has a retractable pitch, as does the University of Phoenix Stadium that hosted this year\u2019s Super Bowl. The advantage for these stadiums is the ability to grow the grass in a more natural environment, outside, away from the shadows of the stands while also having the capacity to stage different events without damaging the playing surface. A feat of modern engineering, a pitch can be moved outside the stadium in less than four hours. A spokesman for Tottenham said: \u2018The club has always seen the new stadium as being at the heart of the regeneration of the area and it is important, therefore, to look at how we future-proof the design, as well as increasing the functionality of the stadium, whilst being conscious of community uses. At this stage it is about looking at options but nothing more.\u2019\n"]}

The Prime Minister, who travelled to Glasgow this morning to unveil the Tory Party's Scottish manifesto, accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' to Britain. He said the two parties were pretending to 'slug it out' ahead of next month's poll \u2013 but insisted they were both working to ramp up spending regardless of the deficit. Scroll down for video . The Prime Minister, who travelled to Glasgow this morning to unveil the Tory Party's Scottish manifesto, accused the SNP and Labour of posing a 'clear and present danger' to Britain . Mr Cameron said Ed Miliband could now only become Prime Minister with the support of the SNP. He told activists: 'We meet here in Scotland in the middle of a massive political fight. We've got Labour and the SNP on opposite sides \u2013 slugging it out \u2013 but if you take a step back they're really on the same side. 'You have a weak Labour party, who want more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes. And the people who will prop them up, the SNP \u2013 who want even more spending, more borrowing, more debt and more taxes.' Mr Cameron said together, the SNP and Labour 'pose a clear threat to the future of our United Kingdom', adding: 'A coalition of chaos.' He said: The SNP acting as the chain to Labour's wrecking ball, running right through our economic recovery - and it will be you who pays the price. With jobs losses, massive tax rises and an economy back on brink of bankruptcy.' Mr Cameron's blistering attack comes ahead of tonight's live TV election debates between the main 'challenger' parties - including Mr Miliband and Ms Sturgeon, alongside the leaders of Ukip, the Greens and Plaid Cymru. Mr Cameron walks with the leader of Scottish Conservatives as they launch the Tories' election manifesto today . David Cameron and Nick Clegg are not taking part because they have been in power for the last five years. Mr Miliband is expected to use the BBC debate to issue a warning to Scottish voters that success for the SNP north of the border could deliver a Conservative government in Westminster. The Labour leader has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP in a hung Parliament, but he is likely to face calls from Ms Sturgeon to join a 'progressive alliance' to bring an immediate end to austerity, which is also backed by Plaid and the Greens. Nicola Sturgeon has called on Ed Miliband to work with the SNP to 'lock out' David Cameron from Number 10 . Conservatives are hoping that the debate would give added bite to their claim that a Miliband administration would be 'in the pocket' of the SNP. Tory deputy chief whip Greg Hands said: 'Will we see the alternative to David Cameron in the Challengers Debate? A Frankenstein coalition to bankrupt and break up Britain.' Mr Clegg, who was campaigning in the north-west, said he asked to take part in the debate, but was 'denied the opportunity' by broadcasters. The Liberal Democrat leader told LBC radio: 'David Cameron, I know, didn't want to participate in it, but I don't see why I should have been denied the opportunity to put the side of the story of what the coalition government has done, even if he didn't want to. 'I find it very odd that the debate tonight doesn't have anybody from one of the parties that have actually been trying to govern our country.' Ms Sturgeon said the debate was 'a fantastic moment of opportunity to deliver the positive change that people are looking for'. 'The SNP will be a positive and constructive voice at Westminster, ready to join others in a progressive alliance to end austerity and protect vital public services like the NHS.' Calling on Mr Miliband to 'change direction', Ms Wood said: 'We're calling for an end to austerity and instead balancing the books through job creation and infrastructure investment. 'It's time weapons of mass destruction were confined to history and we divert funds to improve standards of living and prospects for people.' In the debate, each of the five leaders will be allowed a short opening statement before Dimbleby invites questions from 200 voters. Mr Miliband will be positioned to the far left next to Ms Wood and Mr Farage to the far right next to Ms Sturgeon with Ms Bennett in the middle of the group. The 90-minute programme will cover five subjects. Each question will see one-minute opening statements followed by 10 minutes of free debate.\n"]}

The cookbook, which was supposed to be released last Month was delayed before being cancelled\u00a0completely by Pan Macmillan\u00a0over grave concerns about a recipe for baby formula made from liver and bone broth. Scroll down for video . Pete Evans' (pictured) book was dumped by publishers Pan Macmillan after it was revealed that one of the recipes included the ingredients liver and bone broth .

'We're very confident that this is a very safe, gentle, beautiful book for children,' she said. 'We're really confident that the information we've got in the book is very good information,' Padarin added. 'It is a recipe book, it's not a way of treatment or medicine. If people have issues then yes, of course they should be seeing a practitioner about it.' The pair did address the controversial 'Happy Tummy Brew' recipe which attracted criticism for it's  ingredients, claiming they have added more vitamin C to the formula. The recipe is based on a formula by a US health company called Weston A Price. The Paelo Way co-authors\u00a0Charlotte Carr (centre) and Helen Padarin (right) have spoken out in defence of Pete Evan's (left) decision to release the book independently . Pete Evans is famously known for his role as a judge on My Kitchen Rules alongside Manu Fieldel (left) 'We had just taken the recipe and put it in [the book] and it needed more details,'  Carr said. 'Happy Tummy Brew','It was called a formula and by definition it's not a formula - it's a drink - so we've changed [the name] and made it really clear about when it should be implemented in the child's diet so it's really safe.' Professor Heather Yeatman, president of the Public Health Association of Australia said there was a 'very real possibility that a baby may die if this book goes ahead'. However, the book is reportedly set for release online amidst the controversy. Australian Women's Weekly\u00a0recently reported that Naturopath Helen Padarin had been slammed by the Health Care Complaints Commission with sources saying she breached their codes of conduct. Pete Evans has been dropped as the celebrity ambassador for popular salad chain 'Sumo Salad' She reportedly provided incorrect information over the nutritional comparisons between breast milk and baby formula made of liver and bone broth - a recipe in Bubba Yum Yum. Blogger and co-author, Charlotte Carr has also received negative headlines after it was revealed that she has been doing voice-overs for fast-food chains KFC, Coca-Cola and Cadbury's whilst promoting a paleo lifestyle. In March, chef Pete Evans declared that he was forging ahead with his plans to release the book independently after being sensationally dumped by his publisher. 'Charlotte, Helen and I are thrilled to announce that 'Bubba Yum Yum The Paleo Way' will be a proudly independent digital worldwide release in April with print to follow,' Evans' Facebook post read at the time. Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way is set to be self-published at the end of this month as a digital book .

'A huge thank goes out to all the media for helping raise awareness about this over the last week, we hope you continue to do more of the same.' Pan Macmillan also distanced themselves from the TV chef's baby book, posting a statement to their website to say they would not be publishing the book in any format. Sumo Salad maintains that their decision was not due to Evans' paleo controversies . 'The authors of Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way - for new mums, babies and toddlers have decided to release a digital version of the book very shortly, and will, therefore, no longer publish the book, in any format, with Pan Macmillan Australia,' a statement from the publisher read. The celebrity chef lost another profitable deal at the start of April after being dropped as an ambassador by the national salad chain, Sumo Salad. The food chain strongly denied that the move was related to Evans' recent paleo controversies, and maintained that the decision to not renew his two-year contract was made a long time ago. The head of marketing for Sumo Salad, Petra Orrenius told news.com.au  they had a positive collaboration with Pete Evans but had been with him for too long. They have decided to take their marketing in a different direction and this does not include Evans. 'I think often when you're trying to make a difference you have to be a bit radical and stand out.

A dramatic, frenetic 12 rounds here saw the Irishman sent sprawling in the very first against the dangerous Peter Quillin, the man who vacated the WBO middleweight title Lee won so gloriously in Las Vegas last December before the result was deemed a draw. It was the first time the reigning champion had gone the distance. No mean feat considering he fought for a lengthy period with a strained biceps muscle in his left arm. Peter Quillin (left) and Andy Lee stand with the referee after the judges declared their bout a draw . The two fighters embrace following their exciting 12-round contest in Brooklyn on Saturday night . Lee retains his WBO belt after Quillin failed to make the required 160lbs weight on Friday . Quillin's unbeaten record remains intact following the tie though he threw fewer punches than Lee . The two fighters congratulate each other at the end of the 12 rounds, which were judged to be a draw . With Quillin dramatically failing to make the required weight of 160lbs on Friday, Lee strode out in front of a healthy crowd knowing whatever happens, his belt wasn't going anywhere. Yet this was still one hell of a contest and when the judges correctly called it a tie, no-one was really arguing. While it was scored 113-112, 112-113, 113-113, the statistics told a different story . Lee threw more punches (299-267) and connected with greater frequency (113-103). It was a warrior-like display. Not maybe enough to have destroyed Quillin's unbeaten record, but impressively solid and energetic. Lee, however, was hard on himself. 'It was a tough fight, he dropped me at the start because I was lazy, ' he said. 'I had the momentum late on. I understand with two knockdowns people may have thought he won but I could have done better.' Billy Joe Saunders is the mandatory challenger and looks the likeliest next opponent. Another meeting with Quillin, although intriguing with the title on the line, is highly unlikely. Lee was knocked to the canvas by Quillin during the very first round of the contest in New York . Lee admitted he had been 'lazy' in the early stages of the fight, leading to his knockdown and standing count . Quillin is ordered to the corner after Lee falls later in the bout . 'If my next fight is Quillin it should be in Ireland. He has an Irish surname. Maybe he has some ancestors there,' smiled Lee, who will now look forward to a few weeks off to recharge the batteries before making his next move. Only the American will know how, even though he last fought a year ago, his team somehow allowed their man to miss the weight so spectacularly. The 31-year-old was over by almost a pound-and-a-half. Trainer Adam Booth thought he looked over the limit in the build-up. Lee would never display such a lack of professionalism. The 30-year-old in the form and shape of his life. Title fight or not, this was the Irishman's chance to show he belongs at boxing's top table. A polished display was the order of the evening to ensure his rapier-like trajectory continues this year. Quillin insisted before the clash it would be like a chess match. He was right, yet playing with Kings or Queens don't often lead to the explosion of power which sent Lee spiralling to the canvas at the end of the first round. Quillin's right connects with Lee's right shoulder during the Middleweight bout . Lee and Quillin exchange punches at close quarters during the tight contest . Lee is put onto the pack foot as Quillin lines up a punch with his right . Quillin's right hook rocked the Irishman who was given a standing count. It was just the second time he'd hit the floor, taking in both his amateur and professional career. No wonder Lee looked dazed. The American was quickly showing why he's the proud owner of an unblemished record. A razor-sharp combination had Lee reeling again but the Limerick man is a true warrior. A far better third saw Quillin on the backfoot for the first time as, after such a frenetic start, everything began to calm somewhat. Lee went down again and although it was originally scored as a knockdown it later emerged Quillin had stepped on his foot. If the scorecard had taken that into account, a draw could well have turned into an Irish win. Nevertheless, Lee needed some respite. The Brooklyn crowd unleashed some booing to display their displeasure at both fighters standing their ground. Yet the Irishman, who won his last two fights by coming from behind to land the killer blow, wouldn't have care a jot. Heading into the sixth, Quillin was ahead in the eyes of the judges. Lee, the master of coming from behind to snatch victory, needed something special. Quillin connects with Lee's cheek with a crunching right . Quillin again makes contact but over the course of the whole fight, he landed fewer punches . The comeback came at the end of the seventh, a crunching right leaving a very open Quillin tumbling. It was the first time he'd been down in his career. Lee, though, needed more heading into the tenth. The final rounds were dramatic without ever really looking terminal for either fighter. And when the last bell rang, Lee and the amiable Quillin hugged and showed a deep admiration towards each other which has been evident all week. 'The judges see it their way and I respect the decision, ' said the American. 'There is a first time for everything, I got knocked down and thankfully I got up. There is no perfect story, I come from nothing so to have something is a blessing as is going home to a family I love. 'Respect to Andy Lee though.'\n"]}

Denayer made his full international debut in Belgium's 1-0 European Championship qualifying victory in Israel on Tuesday night, coming on as a substitute after Vincent Kompany was sent off. The 19-year-old also faces competition from Kompany at City, and Deila would welcome another season-long loan arrangement. Celtic want to keep Manchester City defender Jason Denayer (left) on loan for another season . Hearts captain Danny Wilson is another defensive target for Celtic manager Ronny Deila . But, with Denayer due to spend pre-season with his parent club in a bid to prove himself, there is no guarantee he will return, and certainly not in time for Celtic's Champions League qualifying campaign beginning in mid-July. So Deila confirmed he would look to sign a centre-back and responded to reports that former Rangers player Wilson was among his list of potential targets. 'That is one of many names we are talking about but there is nothing serious in that,' Deila said. 'But he's a good player.' Deila, who spent last week watching Norway training before their 5-1 defeat in Croatia, added: 'Jason is going back to Manchester City after the season to have a pre-season and we will see if we can get him back or not. That is something we want, but we have to co-operate with City. 'But I think it's good for him to stay here because hopefully we will get Champions League qualification and that will make him even more experienced. 'Jason is ambitious - he wants to play at the highest level he can. But it's playing that is the most important thing, and playing at Manchester City is very, very hard. If not, I think Celtic is a good club for him.' Celtic boss Ronny Deila has confirmed that he will ask Manchester City if he can keep Denayer next season . Denayer rises highest to score against Aberdeen at Celtic Park at the beginning of last month . Celtic were involved in another loan deal this week when 18-year-old midfielder Liam Henderson joined Rosenborg until the summer. Henderson has made 22 first-team appearances, but competition has increased recently with the signings of Stuart Armstrong and Gary Mackay-Steven. 'Rosenborg called me and asked if we had a midfielder that could be available and Liam Henderson is a very, very talented player and he needs games,' Deila said. 'This was a good move for him. We have a lot of options in midfield and he can play until July 1 and get as much experience as possible. It's a big club as well - the biggest club in Norway, high expectations there. This will give him more experience as a player and a person. 'He was quite keen and that's what good about Liam - he is so ambitious. He really wants to play and develop all the time. 'He saw this as a very good move for him and I made it quite clear that it's not as if I don't want him - it's just because I think it's good for his development. If I was selfish, I would keep him here.' Denayer, pictured celebrating a goal in August last year, is hoping to break into Manchester City's first-team . When asked if more Scottish players should experience playing abroad, Deila said: 'Abroad or not, I'm not sure what is best, but you have to learn a different culture, different ways of playing football, which is positive, and also learning a language and getting away from a safe environment. 'They are positive things but the most important thing is to get experience on the pitch.' Deila is hoping to get all of his players back fit from international duty ahead of their Scottish Premiership clash at St Mirren Park on Friday night, but Charlie Mulgrew (hamstring tendon) and Mikael Lustig (ankle) are still missing. 'Charlie is progressing, the same with Lustig, but the two injuries are very hard to get right,' Deila said. 'Things are going in the right direction but we have to be patient because if we start too early they will have the same injury again and we will be another two or three months. 'We will not take any risks but hopefully they will be available before the end of the season. Charlie is training half the session but still a long way to get 100 per cent.'\n"]}

Goncalo Amaral had been on trial over claims he made in a book and a documentary that the couple were involved in their daughter Madeleine's disappearance. In a written verdict, a Lisbon court agreed that Amaral should pay Mr and Mrs McCann \u20ac250,000 (\u00a3179,000) each in damages and banned further sales of his book The Truth Of The Lie. The couple's lawyer Isabel Duarte also revealed that Amaral had been told to pay interest which she said stood at present at \u20ac106,000 (\u00a376,000). Scroll down for video . Kate and Gerry McCann have reportedly been awarded \u00a3360,000 in damages from an ex-Portuguese detective who wrote a book claiming their daughter Madeleine had died in an accident instead of being abducted . Police chief Goncalo Amaral (above) ran the initial investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann . Madeleine was three when she went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007, as her parents dined at a nearby tapas restaurant with friends. Mr Amaral, who led the initial investigation into Madeleine's disappearance, released his book three days after the case was closed in 2008. He later took part in a documentary for Portuguese television in which he claimed that Madeleine was dead, that there had been no abduction and the McCanns had hidden her body. The couple, who accuse Amaral of hampering the search for their daughter, had been expected to receive around \u00a31million in damages. Amaral's lawyers have leave to appeal the ruling. The McCanns told the court last summer they were left 'devastated and crushed' by his book, which sold around 120,000 copies before it was withdrawn when the couple won an injunction against the ex-police chief. Mrs McCann, 47, said Madeleine's twin siblings Sean and Amelie, now ten, knew Mr Amaral had written a book but didn't know the detail. Amaral claimed Madeleine (above) had not been abducted, but had died in an accident in Praia da Luz . She told the court last July after applying to make a statement: 'I believe that's what's in Mr Amaral's book and the documentary is very distressing to adults. 'To a child, it could be very damaging.' Asked by the judge how she felt after reading the book, she said: 'I was devastated.

A team of 31 British detectives are working exclusively to find the girl. Mystery: British police shift through soil on an area of wasteland during a search for Madeleine McCann in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in June last year during their investigation into her disappearance . The Metropolitan Police was tasked with investigating the disappearance after her family made a personal plea to David Cameron in 2011. Since Madeleine vanished, every possible theory has been explored, including that she was kidnapped by a paedophile or killed during a botched burglary. Others include being snatched by traffickers and sold to a childless couple and that she wandered out of the apartment and died in a tragic accident. However, not one shred of proof of what happened to Madeleine has been uncovered. Detective Chief Inspector Nicola Wall, who took over Operation Grange in December, and her team travelled to Portugal to interview seven suspects and four witnesses, but have not released any information about what they discovered. Portuguese prosecutors also reopened their probe into Madeleine's disappearance last year and are conducting a separate investigation to one led by Scotland Yard.\n"]}

US Department of the Treasury officials insist the $20 Double Eagles were stolen from the US Mint in Philadelphia before the 1933 series was melted down when the country went off the gold standard. They argued that Joan Langbord and her sons cannot lawfully own the coins, which she said she found in a family bank deposit box in 2003. Scroll down for video . Ten 1933 Double Eagle coins, which were almost all destroyed when the US went off the gold standard, have been given back to the Langbord family after a length legal dispute with the government . The family found the valuables in a bank deposit box for Joan Langbord's father Israel Switt, a Philadelphia jeweler (left, in 1944). The government believed that Switt stole the coins from a mint in 1933 . Langbord's father, jeweler Israel Switt, had dealings with the Mint in the 1930s and was twice investigated over his coin holdings. A jury in 2012 sided with the government. However, the appeals court returned the coins to the Langbords because US officials had not responded within a 90-day limit to the family's seized-property claim, filed in about 2004. Family lawyer Barry Berke said: 'Congress clearly intended for there to be limits on the government's ability to seek forfeiture of citizens' property, and today's ruling reaffirms that those limits are real and won't be excused when the government violates them.' Langbord, who's in her mid-80s, worked in her father's store on Jeweler's Row for most of her life. Her sons, entertainment lawyer Roy Langbord, of New York City, and David Langbord, of Virginia Beach, Virginia, joined her in the legal fight. Nearly half a million of the coins were minted in 1933, though almost all were melted and a surviving coin sold for $7.6million in 2002 . The coins were never released to the public after President Franklin Delano Roosevelt switched the US off the gold standard . They do not plan to comment on the ruling and have not decided whether the coins will be sold, Berke said. Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens designed the Double Eagle with a flying eagle on one side and a figure representing liberty on the other. One Double Eagle, once owned by King Farouk of Egypt, sold in 2002 for $7.6 million, then a record for a coin. Its later owner, a London coin dealer once jailed by the US over it, split the proceeds with the US in a deal brokered by Berke. The Langbords offered the government a similar split but were rebuffed. The family had taken the coins to the Secret Service in Philadelphia to have them examined, Berke said. A coin that was that was once owned by King Farouk of Egypt (left) fetched millions thirteen years ago. The Langbords brought their coins into the government for authentication, but the valuables were seized . 'They authenticated the coins and said, 'Thank you very much. We will now be keeping them,'' he said. The Mint struck nearly a half-million of the Double Eagles in Philadelphia in 1933 but never released them after President Franklin D. Roosevelt abandoned the gold standard and prohibited using the gold coins as currency. The money makers in Philadelphia sent all of their gold coins to be melted in 1937, according to Bloomberg. The . 1933 'Double Eagle' was dreamed up by President Roosevelt\u2019s distant . cousin,Theodore, who had commissioned the sculptor Augustus . Saint-Gaudens to re-design the $20 gold coin in the early 1900s. Teddy Roosevelt wanted an American coin that matched the beauty of the ancient Greek ones. The last run of nearly 500,000 coins were never released, and it was thought they were all melted down for scrap. In industry speak, an 'eagle' is $10, hence the term 'double eagle' for the $20 1933 examples. While prosecutors argued to jurors in 2011 that Switt must have stolen the coins with help from a Mint insider, Berke said he could have traded his scrap gold for them. Alison Frankel, a journalist who wrote a history of the 1933 Double Eagles, told the New York Times\u00a0that Berke had an 'amazing accomplishment' by making the government prove that no coins could have possible gotten out of the mint legally. She said that the government attorneys decided not to prosecute Switt when they learned about his possible involvement in the 1940s because the statute of limitations had passed. Robert W Hoge, curator of North American coins and currency at the American Numismatic Society, said that federal authorities had been 'fanatical' about finding the existing coins. The US Department of Justice said it was reviewing its options after Friday's ruling. A Treasury spokeswoman had no comment. Switt, who died in 1990, admitted to the Secret Service in 1944 that he had possessed and sold a set of nine other Double Eagles, which were recovered and destroyed. The surviving Farouk coin is believed to have been a 10th coin from that batch. The Mint sent a pair of 1933 Double Eagles to the Smithsonian Institution for its US coin collection.\n"]}

Now his girlfriends Brooke Shedd, 26, and Jane Shalakhova, 25, have spoken out to say they are just as fortunate as the 34-year-old who hails from East London. The women say they do not 'share' Adam but are in a 'unique' situation where they both love him - as well as each other. Scroll down for video . Brooke, right, and Jane appeared on today's This Morning with boyfriend Adam to explain how their\u00a0polyamorous relationship works and makes them all happy . The trio appeared on today's This Morning to set the record straight about their relationship after it caused a stir when it hit the headlines last week. 'I don't look at it as me sharing Adam, it's me sharing myself with Adam and Jane,'\u00a0Brooke told intrigued presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford. 'It's three people who fell for each other and into this unique situation.' Brooke has a five-year-old son, Oliver, from a previous relationship and has just had another baby, Dant\u00e9, with Adam. They will raise the boys in Los Angeles with Russian-born Jane, who joined their open relationship after the three of them hit it off so well. The trio explained their open relationship to presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford via a video link from their home in LA . Brooke, from Texas, explained: 'We're weren't looking to add a third person to our relationship when we met Jane, we just enjoyed going out and meeting women. But Jane fell in perfectly and it was serendipitous.' The trio all live together and share a super king-sized bed and Brooke said there's no jealousy between them as they are all in love. Jane agreed that if she ever feels jealousy, it's never over Brooke spending time with Adam but because the pair are having fun without her. She explained: 'When I get jealous, it's me jealous of missing out if I'm at work and not physically with them, it's my two best friends hanging out and I'm not there.' Adam said their relationship works because all parties knew where they stood at the outset. Jane and Brooke say they do not 'share' Adam and are as much in love with each other as they are with him . He said: 'Brooke and I knew when we first met we were open to the possibility of having other women in our relationship. 'It's not that I have two girlfriends, it's that there are three of us in a relationship.' He added: 'I get to hang out with my two best friends every day. We get questioned a lot about whether we're intimate all together. Most of the time it is all three of us. We like to enjoy the benefits of our unique relationship.' Adam revealed his friends and family in the UK are astounded at how he's transformed into a charming lady's man - as at his East London school, he was a 'loser' once voted the least likely to get a girlfriend. The unconventional family are raising two children - Brooke and Adam's newborn, Dante, and Brooke's son Oliver from a previous relationship. Jane is keen to have a baby with Adam in the future too . But he said he gained in confidence after becoming a dating coach and learning techniques to help make himself more attractive. As a result, he says he's not worried if his open relationship leads to Brooke or Jane leaving him for someone else. 'One of the cool things about the journey I have taken is I now have the confidence to meet other women if my partner moves on, so I will move on,' he said. The trio admitted that all their families find their situation bizarre but all are supportive because they know they are so happy and in love. Jane said: 'Imagine you meet your soul mate, now multiply that by two! It's twice the love.'

The information from the satellites has been transformed into an interferogram, which provides a colourful and highly detailed view of the Earth's land mass. By comparing before and after images, scientists have discovered Mount Everest shrank by about one inch due to the land that was shaken in the natural disaster. The tallest point in the world, however, still stands at 29,029 feet, according to The Weather Channel. Additionally, an area 75 miles (120km) by 30 miles (50km) has lifted up 3.2ft (1 metre) from the ground around the capital, Kathmandu. Interferogram over Kathmandu, Nepal, generated from two Sentinel-1A scans on 17 and 29 April 2015 \u2013 before and after the 25 April earthquake. Each \u2018fringe\u2019 of colour represents about 3cm of deformation. The large amount of fringes indicates a large deformation pattern of 3.2ft (1 metre) from the ground around Kathmandu . Scene: A rescue chopper prepares to land, evacuating climbers from higher camps to Everest Base Camp, Nepal. New radar images have shown that Mount Everest shrank one inch following the Nepal earthquake this week . These are the first radar images to reveal the destruction caused by the 7-magnitude earthquake that killed 5,000 people and affected millions more. 'There's a peak of slip just to the northeast of Kathmandu,' Professor Tim Wright from the Natural Environment Research Council told the BBC. He explained that what scientists count are the coloured 'fringes' in the interferogram, of which there are about 34 from this quake. This translates to more than 3.2ft (1 metre) of uplift. To the north of Kathmandu, the interferogram suggests that the ground receded, and it also shows how a fault ruptured east from the epicentre, but did not break the surface. Combining two Sentinel-1A radar scans from 17 and 29 April 2015, this interferogram shows changes on the ground that occurred during the 25 April earthquake that struck Nepal. An overall area of 120x100 km has moved \u2013 half of that uplifted and the other half, north of Kathmandu subsided. Vertical accuracy is a few centimetres .

The interferogram combines two Sentinel-1A images from 17 and 29 April 2015 . Launch: 3 April 2014 \u00a0French Guiana . Life: Minimum of seven years . Mass: 2300 kg (5070 lbs) Dimensions: 9.2ft (2.8m) long, 8.2ft (2.5m) wide, 13ft (4m) high . Mission: Monitoring sea ice, oil spills, winds and waves, land-use change and to respond to emergencies such as floods and earthquakes . How it works: Radar works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back. The satellite uses a technique called 'Synthetic aperture radar interferometry'. Two or more satellite radar images of the same area are combined to detect large-scale changes. Small changes on the ground modify the reflected radar signal and lead to rainbow-coloured fringes in the 'interferogram'. Professor Wright says this suggests not all the strain in the rocks before the earthquake was released in during the catastrophic event. Sentinel-1A's swath width of 155 miles (250km) over land surfaces has allowed for an unprecedented area size to be analysed from a single scan. Scientists say the entire area will be covered under the same geometry every 12 days, allowing for the wider region to be regularly monitored for changes in the land. Its ability to 'see' through cloud and rain and in pitch darkness make it particularly useful for monitoring earthquakes and for offering images for emergency response. This is because it uses radar which works by sending out radio waves and timing how long it takes for them to reflect back. Radio waves travel through air virtually unimpeded, but materials like metal, rock and water act almost as mirrors which can help reveal those areas inundated by floods. It also makes no different to radar if the Earth is in darkness. Sentinel-1A is the first satellite for the Copernicus environment-monitoring programme led by the European Commission. The Copernicus EMS was activated on the day the earthquake struck, prompting Esa to begin collecting satellite imagery, which is being made available to support relief efforts. In parallel, the International Charter Space and Major Disasters was activated by India, China and the UN. Meanwhile, Nasa has posted its own images of the earthquake providing much less detail due to cloud cover. 'While we regularly post imagery of natural hazards, the weather and the satellites haven't cooperated in this case,' the space agency wrote in a blog. 'The orbital track of the satellites and the specific capabilities of the sensors on board determine whether we have imagery to share. In the case of Nepal, things haven't lined up in our favour.' The satellite imagery is used to create maps to support relief efforts, such as this \u2018grading map\u2019 of Kathmandu showing topographic features and crisis information. The red squares show road blockss, the green people markers show crowds, red dots are areas that are destroyed and yellow dots are areas that are possibly affected. The yellow lines mark out primary roads in the area . Sentinel-1 carries a radar that works in several specialised modes to provide detailed imagery (artist's impression left). The data will be used for applications such as monitoring the oceans, including shipping lanes, sea ice and oil spills. It also provides data to map changing land cover and deformations such as those produced by Saturday's devastating Earthquake in Nepal (right) Mount Everest before and after the earthquake. Not much change is visible because of a fresh coat of snow and cloud cover. The April 23 image was acquired by the Operational Land Imager on Landsat 8 .

A close family friend of Logan's, financial pundit Ed Butowsky,confirmed late last month that the 43-year-old had been\u00a0hospitalized and revealed the extent of the journalism heavy hitter's suffering since the attack in Cairo's Tahrir Square.

Butowsky previously \u00a0told Breitbart that Logan had been in and out of the hospital since the attack, which occurred while Logan was reporting on the Arab Spring. On February 11, 2011, Logan was the victim of a 'sustained and brutal' sexual assault as she reported from Cairo on the resignation of President Mubarak. She was surrounded by a mob of 200 - 300 men after being dragged away from her TV crew in Tahrir Square, seconds after Egyptian colleagues heard men talking about wanting to take her pants off. The group  tore her clothes from her body, groped and beat her, she later told\u00a0The New York Times. 'For an extended period of time, they raped me with their hands,' the reporter said and she was subjected to 'aggressive pinching'. She was rescued by a group of women and up to 20 Egyptian soldiers. Logan has since returned to the Middle East. On Sunday, 60 Minutes aired her report on the persecution of Iraqi Christians by ISIS. 'She did the story while ISIS was just four to six miles from where she was reporting,' Butowsky said. 'She did the story over the last four to six months on location in the face of ISIS all while suffering from the brutal sexual assault she suffered at the hands of evil forces at play during the Arab Spring.'

A handful of weeks ago, CBS released a similar statement after Logan was admitted to hospital in late February, as she suffered internal bleeding reportedly from diverticulitis--a potentially stress-related intestinal condition. The foreign affairs correspondent has digestive diverticulitis, reported Page Six. The condition could have been aggravated by stress. She was expected to remain in the hospital for several days to recover. She had since been released at least long enough to complete her report on Iraqi Christians. Diverticulitis, according to the NIH website, occurs when when pouches, called diverticula, form in the colon and then become inflamed. The last few years have not been completely kind to the South Africa native. Aside from her beating and sexual assault in 2011, she was forced in 2011 to take a seven-month leave of absence after admitting her report on the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, was based on a discredited first-hand account.

Now, researchers believe they have come up with a way to tell fossils of small feathered male dinosaurs from those of females. They say that the key differences between the sexes lie in bones near the base of the tail. A pair of turkey-sized \u2018egg thief lizards\u2019 dubbed Romeo and Juliet were found lying next to each other in a 75-million-year-old rock (pictured) in the mid-90s. Palaeontologists led by\u00a0Scott Persons (pictured) believe they can tell males and females apart from certain tail bones . Paleontologistsat the University of Alberta examined a pair of fossils found in Mongolia, which were first described in 2001. One is a complete skeleton, while the other is missing the middle and end of its tail. \u2018Determining a dinosaur\u2019s gender is really hard,\u2019 said graduate student Scott Persons, who is lead author of the study, published in Scientific Reports. \u2018Because soft anatomy seldom fossilises, a dinosaur fossil usually provides no direct evidence of whether it was a male or a female.\u2019 So instead, the researchers looked at indirect evidence of sexually dimorphic display structures, which are evident today in birds. Examples include the fans of peacocks, the tall crests of roosters or the long tail feathers of some birds of paradise, which are used to attract and court mates. They are almost always much larger in males who do the courting, than in females, who do the choosing. They suggest that male oviraptors had broader and longer chevron bones in their tails so they could shake their feather-tipped tail to woo potential mates (illustrated), much like modern peacocks . The team theorised that like birds, small feathered dinosaurs such as oviraptors used long feathers on their tails to attract mates, rather than for flying. \u2018My analysis of the tail skeletons supported this theory, because the skeletons showed adaptations for both high tail flexibility and enlarged tail musculature - both traits that would have helped an oviraptor to flaunt its tail fan in a mating dance,\u2019 Mr Persons said. After studying the fossils carefully, his team found signs of sexual dimorphism in the length and shape of blade-like bones called chevrons, which point downwards from the vertebrae near the base of the tail. A number of chevrons in one of the fossils were longer and had broader tips than those in the other specimen, indicating the creature is male, the experts said. They suggested that males had larger chevrons to anchor the muscles that controlled their flexible, feather-tipped tails. The researchers suspect that male oviraptorosaurs shook their tail feathers in intricate displays to woo potential mates, akin the behaviour of modern-day peacocks. They suspect females had shorter chevrons to make laying eggs easier. Scientists have recently shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Their mating ritual may bear some resemblance to that of small feathered dinosaurs . Scientists have shown that peacocks (stock image) shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear . Scientists have shown that peacocks shake their tails to make a noise that is too low for us to hear. Male birds may make the infrared rumble to scare off an approaching rival or to attract a mate. Researchers at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada, have shown that the birds make infrasound noises - below 20 hertz - using their tails and that other peacocks respond to them. Humans hear a rustling sound when this happens, but the experts found that the birds hear a loud sound of between 70 and 108 decibels, according to the study published in the journal Animal Behaviour. Male and female peacocks became more alert and moved around when the low noises were played back to them by researchers, with males shrieking out in response. Experts are unsure how the birds detect infrasound, but know that some can feel vibration through their legs. Graduate student Angela Freeman observed that male peacocks were most likely to make the low sounds when they showed off their train feathers, producing two displays which she called the \u2018shiver train\u2019 and the \u2018pulse train\u2019. The shiver train is produced by vibration of the train feathers from the centre feathers to the outside of the array and is used by males when females are far away. The pulse train is produced by a vibration emanating from the base of all the train feathers and it is used when the female is nearby. Peacocks\u2019 tails are a sign of strength and good genes, so a strong noise may reinforce a message of virility, Ms Freeman said. This could be especially useful as the birds live in scrubby woodland, where high noises can only travel over short distances and birds sometimes can\u2019t see each other. \u2018We think that possibly these signals could signal to females and males who are out of sight behind a bush or over the hill,\u2019 she added. The two raptors were discovered in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Both died and were buried next to each other when a large sand dune collapsed on top of them, creating the interesting fossil. When they were first unearthed, the two oviraptors were given the nicknames Romeo and Juliet because they seemed reminiscent of Shakespeare's famously doomed lovers. \u2018We discovered that, although both oviraptors were roughly the same size, the same age and otherwise identical in all anatomical regards, \u201cRomeo\u201d had larger and specially shaped tail bones,\u2019 Mr Persons said. \u2018This indicates that it had a greater capacity for courtship displays and was likely a male.\u2019 By comparison, the second specimen, Juliet, had shorter and simpler tail bones, suggesting a lesser capacity for peacocking, and has been interpreted as a female. According to Persons, the two may very well have been a mated pair, making for a romantic story, as the dinosaur couple was preserved side by side for more than 75 million years.

Author Martin Fletcher points the finger at the late Stafford Heginbotham, Bradford City's chairman at the time and a businessman who had been linked to eight previous blazes. 'Could any man really be as unlucky as Heginbotham?' writes Fletcher, after 15 years spent researching the fire in which four members of his family died. The fire at Bradford City's Valley Parade claimed 56 victims and injured 265 on May 11, 1985 . The 30th anniversary is approaching since the tragic fire that killed 56 people at Bradford's ground in 1985 . Fire engulfs Valley Parade on a day nobody can ever forget as 56 were killed at the football stadium . A police officer uses his helmet to shield the heat from his face as he runs in front of the stand on fire . Then-Bradford chairman Stafford Heginbotham (left) with Mr Justice Popplewell in front of the burned stand . 1: May 1967: fire in Stafford Heginbotham's factory at Cutler Heights Lane . 2: April 1968: fire at Genefoam Ltd, managing director is Heginbotham . 3: August 1970: store-room explosion at Matgoods, founded by Heginbotham . 4: Dec 1971: tenant fire at Castle Mills, Cleckheaton, owned by Heginbotham . 5: August 1977: fire at Yorkshire Knitting Mills, in Heginbotham-owned Douglas Mills building . 6: Dec 1977: fire at Coronet Marketing factory. Coronet a subsidiary of Tebro Toys, owned by Heginbotham . 7: Nov 1977: fire with toxic fumes at his Douglas Mills factory . 8: June 1981: fire in a plastics factory at Douglas Mills . His brother Andrew, 11, his father John, 34, his uncle Peter, 32, and his grandfather Eddie, 63, were among the 54 Bradford supporters and two Lincoln supporters who did not survive. Fletcher, who was 12 at the time became determined to challenge the accepted theories which he believes were founded upon a flawed investigation. He discovered that Heginbotham, who died in 1995 at the age of 61, had been connected to at least eight other fires at business premises and insurance claims dating back to 1967. His findings have been published in Fifty-Six \u2013 The Story of the Bradford Fire, which is being serialised in The Guardian. It stops short of a direct accusation of arson but inferences are clear and he is certain more should have been done at the time to investigate the disaster and those responsible. He hopes these questions can be officially addressed and that his research will prompt a new investigation into the disaster as the 30th anniversary approaches next month. No-one has sought accountability for the fire since the official inquiry chaired by High Court judge Oliver Popplewell recorded its findings following five days of hearings held less than a month after the blaze. The inquiry found that a small fire was probably caused by a spark from a discarded cigarette or match dropped through a gap in the wooden frame of the main stand on to piles of rubbish which had been collecting for years. It was the final game of the season and should have been a day of celebration. Before kick-off Bradford were presented before with the trophy for winning the Third Division title. The fire was noticed towards the end of the first half and within four minutes the stand packed with 4,000 spectators was fully ablaze. There were no fire extinguishers and no designated fire escapes. A 12-year-old Martin Fletcher is comforted by his mother Susan in 1985 after the Bradford Fire disaster .

Prime minister Margaret Thatcher visits the scene of the disaster with her husband Dennis in 1985 . Tributes paid to the 56 who were killed by the fire on the same day Bradford should have been celebrating . His many businesses included toy company Tebro Toys. He once described football as 'the opera of the people'. After an initial spell as Bradford chairman, he came back in 1983 when he and another local businessman, Jack Tordoff, saved Bradford from the receivers, buying the club for around \u00a330,000 each. Heginbotham resigned as chairman in 1988 due to ill health. He died on April 21 1995 after a heart transplant. He was 61. The tragedy, followed by Heysel, less than three weeks later, and Hillsborough in 1989, accelerated safety changes in football ground. The community turned inwards to comfort each other. They raised money for the Burns Unit at Bradford Royal Infirmary and supported friends through the aftermath of loss, physical pain and the psychological problems. They were not inspired by the need to fight and clear their names like the families of those killed at Hillsborough. As a whole they accepted it was a terrible accident and nothing came from the media or the courts to change that view. Bradford City reacted to early criticism that it had failed to honour the tragedy and there are memorials in the city centre and at the stadium and an annual memorial service, attended mostly by a few hundred of the people most closely affected. In 2010, on the 25th anniversary, there were an estimated two thousand at the service in the city's Centenary Square but this year there has been such a surge of interest that the club considered moving it to Valley Parade. Times have changed and social media has fuelled a craving for public outpourings of sympathy. Football's authorities decided that this year there would be a minute's silence before all games on April 25, when Bradford play Barnsley at Valley Parade. It is the final game of the season and Bradford always remember the victims of the fire at the home game closest to the anniversary. Representatives from Bradford and Lincoln have also been invited to Wembley for the FA Cup semi-finals this weekend and the FA will be represented at the annual memorial service in Bradford on May 11. These are specific to the 30th anniversary and yet are in tune with a general increase in attention which has coincided with an upturn in the club's fortunes. But it sits uneasily with many at Valley Parade. Then-Bradford chairman  Heginbotham (left) outside Valley Parade, where 56 people died and 265 were injured . The remains of the stand at Bradford's ground after the disaster on Saturday May 11, 1985 at Valley Parade . Investigators look around the burned out stand at Bradford's ground following the tragedy in 1985 . The charred remains of a Bradford programme from the day of the fire in which 56 people were killed . Author Martin Fletcher writes about his own experience at the Bradford Disaster, and asks why chairman Stafford Heginbotham was not investigated: . 'Why was it left to the 12-year-old who lost three generations and four members of his family, who was with over 40 people when they died within a 10-yard radius of him, who somehow got out of the stand, as the last person to get out, the only person to get out the front after being at the back, and the only person to survive the smoke?' Many supporters were unsure about a memorial flag which was taken to Wembley when Bradford reached the League Cup final two years ago. Arsenal and Hull fans then applauded in the 56th minute of last year's FA Cup final, a well-intentioned mark of solidarity copied by Oldham fans at Valley Parade, this season. Others have turned up and started to sing 'Stand up for the 56'. Again, this has provoked a mixed response. Some Bradford supporters believe the victims should be remembered in this way, others prefer it to keep it private. A stage documentary called The 56 is touring local theatres and children's entertainers the Chuckle Brothers have launched a charity single with members of Black Lace. Another fan has been selling old seats numbered 1-56 which were reclaimed from the stand this year while '56' branded hoodies and T-shirts are on sale, some more tasteful than others. Profits from some of these ventures will go to the Plastic Surgery and Burns Research Unit (PSBRU) at the University of Bradford, set up by Professor David Sharpe after the fire. In another year of success for Bradford City, with FA Cup wins against Chelsea and Sunderland, the club has found the dynamic is altering around what was once called football's less remembered tragedy. It may never be the same again after Martin Fletcher's book. He started his own investigations in 1994, when his mother told him Valley Parade had not been Heginbotham's first fire. The more he unearthed, the more his mind was made up. His findings will disturb the peace in Bradford.\n"]}

The image which shows the One Direction member poised with the suspicious roll-up and sitting next to a plastic tub containing a dry, green weed-like substance and rolling paper was taken on Wednesday amid 48 hours during which Tomlinson has been seen partying hard. That same day Tomlinson, 23, was photographed returning to his London hotel in a disheveled state clutching a glass of water. Louis, newly single having split from long-term girlfriend Eleanor Calder, left London\u2019s Cirque du Soir nightclub at 4am this morning and returned to his hotel in the company of five girls. Scroll down for video . After the party: Louis Tomlinson returns to his hotel in London's Soho yesterday, after partying. It appears to be after the pictures were taken . In today\u2019s new picture, apparently taken in London  during this two-day party session, Tomlinson appears to be smiling as he balances a magazine on his lap, smiling distractedly at a girl by his side as he prepares the suspicious cigarette. It is the latest blow to the boy band just one month after Zayn Malik announced his decision to quit the band. Shortly before his announcement it had emerged that Zayn, 22, and Louis were being forced to post bonds worth close to $12,000 to be allowed into the Philippines where they were due to play a concert in Manila. The money was to be forfeited if either were caught using illegal drugs while there. And today\u2019s picture comes in the wake of a video filmed last April where the pair were seen joking about drugs as they appeared to share a joint during the Latin American Leg of their 2014 stadium tour. The explosive video obtained by Daily Mail Online last May sent shock waves through One Direction\u2019s young fan base. 'Happy days': What Louis Tomlinson was heard saying as Zayn Malik smoked what appeared to be marijuana as the band was ferried to a stadium in Lima, the capital of Peru, for a concert . Still partying: Louis Tomlinson heading for a night on the town in London yesterday . Crowd in: One Direction star Louis Tomlinson leaves London's Cirque Du Soir with five girls, who went back with him to his hotel in Soho . Louis could be heard narrating from behind the camera as he filmed his bandmate on their way to a One Direction concert in Lima, Peru. At one point he announced: \u2018So here we are, leaving Peru. Joint lit. Happy days!\u2019 Fellow band members Harry Styles, Liam Payn and Niall Horan were not present as, during the 15 minute journey in a smoke filled SUV, Louis, from Doncaster, and Zayn, from Bradford, joked with each other and three members of their crew who are travelling with them. A member of the team asked about the filming: \u2018Are we allowed to talk contraband in this?\u2019 Louis replied: \u2018Yes, that\u2019s what it is about.\u2019 Current line-up: The four-member version of One Direction performs in South Africa last month after the departure of Zayn Malik to pursue a solo career . The way they were: Clean-cut One Direction - from left Harry Styles, Zayn Malik, Niall Horan, Louis Tomlinson and Liam Payne . Adopting a faux serious tone as he focused on Zayn who sat beside him wearing jeans and a Bob Marley T-shirt, Louis said: \u2018Zayn takes his job very seriously. He makes sure he goes through a two hour intense warm-up before every show. Just to get himself in the zone for the show. \u2018One very, very important factor of Zayn\u2019s warm up of course is Mary J herself. IN fact I will present it to him now for some fantastic singing.\u2019 The band faced heavy criticism after the video leak with thousands of fans dumping tickets to their shows. Liam Payne tweeted an apology saying, \u2018I love my boys and maybe things have gone a little sideways. I apologize for that.\u2019 He added: \u2018We are only in our 20s and we all do stupid things at this age.\u2019 Daily Mail Online has approached the band's spokesman for comment.\n"]}

The Miami-Dade Police Department set up a hidden camera to deal with the ongoing problem of luggage theft, and found workers rifling through checked bags both before they were loaded onto planes and once inside the aircraft's belly. This as it is revealed that airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014. Scroll down for video . Police also caught baggage handlers at Miami International Airport (above) stealing from passenger luggage after installing a hidden camera . A baggage handler (above) at JFK Airport in New York was also caught on camera going through a passenger's wallet . CNN\u00a0reports that 31 employees have been arrested for theft in Miami since 2012, including six this year. Incidents of theft at that airport are far less however that New York's John F. Kennedy, which has more claims of lost property that anywhere else in the country. In 2013, El Al Airlines set up a hidden camera at that airport, and found workers stealing cash, jewelry, iPhones and iPads, which led to six arrests. Across the country in Los Angeles, 16 airport workers were fired last year after police obtained search warrants for their homes following a increase in reported thefts at the terminal where they were employed. 'We cut theft in those two terminals by 60% because of doing that aggressive investigative work,' said Patrick Gannon, the police chief at that airport. Overall, there have been 30,621 claims of missing valuables since 2010, with most of these coming from checked luggage. Of those claims, 2,493 occurred at John F. Kennedy International Airport. Airline customers have reported $2.5million in lost property from 2010 to 2014 (above a JFK employee) Most shocking however may be how easy it is for airport employees to steal, with only Orlando and Miami screening employees through metal detectors as they arrive at work and only Miami screening them when they leave. Since 2002, the TSA has fired 513 workers for theft, though it is now known how many of them faced criminal charges. Gannon believes that theft is not the only problem either, as it could lead to bigger threats in the nation's airports. 'I absolutely think that if we don't pay attention to the small things that happen around here, that it could lead to much larger things. So there is, I believe, a connection between baggage theft and terrorism.'\n"]}

{"question_id": 471, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)I'm haunted by the video of Officer Michael Slager firing eight shots at Walter Scott as he fled his encounter with North Charleston police -- his back turned to the officer. What I find more disturbing is how the officer cuffs the fallen Scott and allows him to die face-down in the dirt while Slager appears to plant an item next to his body. I understand why people are skeptical of self-defense claims -- especially from law enforcement. If not for the video taken by a bystander, I can't help but think that this story would be shuttered behind the wall of an active investigation. As a defense attorney, I am more sensitive than anyone to the assumption of innocence for those accused of a crime, but this single piece of evidence -- a video of a man shot in the back while in full retreat -- defies any reasonable explanation. Thank God there was a camera. It will help ensure that justice will be served in this case. However, there is another camera that -- had it been deployed -- might have prevented the entire tragedy: a police body camera. Throughout the entire encounter with Scott, it's clear Slager had no idea someone was filming him. Had he known there would be video of his every move, would he have drawn his weapon on a fleeing man?  Would he have fired?  Eight times?  Would he have misrepresented the encounter on his police report? Of course not. If Slager had been wearing a body camera, Scott would probably still be alive, and Slager wouldn't be facing the possibility of life in prison -- or a possible death sentence. Body cameras are expensive to deploy, sure. And storing the massive amounts of data that body cameras create costs even more. That cost, however -- if we're talking the monetary kind -- may be eclipsed by the punitive damages delivered to Scott's family in an inevitable civil suit against the North Charleston Police Department. Most importantly, we have to ask ourselves this: What's the value of a human life? Certainly it's worth the price of some mass data storage. And there's something else at stake. The public is losing confidence in law enforcement, and the strained relationship between minorities and police is reaching a breaking point. Every police shooting that captures headlines justifies an ever increasing fear of cops in the street. As fear ratchets up, so does the tension between cops and the people in the communities they serve. As tension rises, the risk of more shootings increases. It is a cycle of destruction that could lead to chaos. Police body cameras can help break this cycle. Studies have shown that both cops and people in the community act better when they know they are on camera. Complaints against cops decrease, and, most importantly, use-of-force incidents drop. I will admit that body cameras are only an interim solution. They only help compensate for the real underlying problem, which is this: There is a bias against black men that has infiltrated the criminal justice system, and we are seeing it in the disproportionate shooting of black men. When we look at this footage -- and when we see the dashboard camera from the other South Carolina officer who last year shot a man who was reaching for his driver's license -- it's clear that many cops are more likely to interpret actions, even routine actions, from black men as potentially aggressive. These may not be overtly racist cops. They may not intentionally treat black men differently, but we can't pretend that black men aren't being disproportionately targeted. All across the country, we see it happening, and with the proliferation of video, we're seeing it happen with alarming frequency. Somehow, we're going to have to beat this bias out of our system. Set tougher employment screening standards when hiring cops. Institute more training to help officers recognize the bias and adjust for it. As a society, we have to focus on the broad social changes needed to address disparities in income, education and opportunities -- disparities that keep us a racially divided nation. But social change, sadly, may take generations of hard work. In the meantime, if we can't immediately root out racial bias, we can at least put a bright spotlight on it, and we can start by focusing on the one interaction where racial bias results in the loss of life -- we can start by placing body-mounted cameras on cops.\n"]}

Jeff Green, then playing for the Boston Celtics, was looking forward to getting back to the hardwood. That was until a routine physical stopped him in his tracks. The physical revealed he had an aortic aneurysm near the left valve of his heart. \"I was shocked,\" said the Memphis Grizzlies small forward. \"I had no symptoms of fatigue, shortness of breath.\" Green had to have open heart surgery. \"Leading up to it was nerve-racking,\" he said. \"I couldn't run. I couldn't touch a basketball. I couldn't get stressed out, it was tough.\" As Green learned how doctors would open up his chest to repair his heart, he considered the possibility he may never play basketball again. \"The first couple of weeks after I was told, I really focused in on my career and what was next,\" said the basketball player. \"I wanted to make sure if I wanted to come back, I was able to come back and play the same way I did before I left.\" If that opportunity wasn't there, Green wanted to have a backup plan.

Accompanied to the ring by Vinnie Jones, the featherweight was never in trouble but failed to deliver the stoppage that had looked a formality during the contest. Josh Warrington (right) poses with Vinnie Jones after his victory over Dennis Tubieron . 'A couple of times I thought would get him out of there. I was getting a bit bored by the end,' Warrington said. 'It was good to get 12 rounds. I want to get some experience under my belt.' The home favourite also picked up the vacant WBC International title which should improve his current ranking as he chases a world title shot within the next 12 months. Tubieron fought for the same belt last December when he drew with Carlo Magali and the Filipino's record of 19 wins from 24 fights suggested he would struggle against Warrington who is now unbeaten in 21 contests. The 24-year-old has been billed as the next Ricky Hatton due to his impressive fan base . Warrington admitted he was bored by the end of his fight against Dennis Tubieron (right) Tubieron, a year older than his opponent, had previously boxed at both bantamweight and lightweight before opting to settle for the division in between. And he was certainly the smaller man in the ring as Warrington made a fast start, picking the visitor off with punches to both head and body. Tubieron had previously been stopped twice and was content to fight on the back foot, his face marking up in the second round although the Filipino did attempt to mount a response. He briefly threatened midway through the third session with his first sustained attack but Warrington finished the stronger. Tubieron of the Philippines looks to land a punch during the bout at the First Direct Arena in Leeds . After an even fourth, Tubieron stepped on the accelerator in the fifth before Warrington fought back. Bizarrely, the bell to end the stanza did not ring until four minutes had passed, allowing the home favourite to drive home his advantage. Tubieron looked exhausted as he retreated to his corner but was given a brief break in the sixth round when a beach ball thrown from the crowd interrupted the action. The timekeeper then stopped the action almost 60 seconds early, attempting to rectify his earlier mistake. Judges awarded Warrington a landslide victory by scores of 119-109 twice and and 119-110 . Tubieron looked ready to fold several times during the seventh and eighth rounds before showing remarkable heart to find a response. If there has been a criticism of Warrington's career to date it is that he lacks the power needed at the top level and despite throwing everything at Tubieron, the Filipino was still standing at the start of the penultimate round. And he deservedly heard the final bell as Warrington failed to deliver the stoppage in the last session before the judges awarded him a landslide victory by scores of 119-109 twice and and 119-110.

David Cameron will today risk infuriating the SNP by vowing to conduct an annual review of the fairness of the Scottish government\u2019s policies on the rest of the UK. A Conservative government would create a new principle to ensure decisions by Holyrood do not have an \u2018unforeseen detrimental effect\u2019 for people south of the border, he will say. The Prime Minister will tell voters in England that new powers for the Scottish Parliament mean it \u2018can now have a big impact on your job, your income, and investment in your area\u2019. Mr Cameron will call the idea the \u2018Carlisle Principle\u2019 \u2013 named to reflect the sort of border communities in the rest of the UK that could be particularly badly affected by decisions taken by the Scottish government. There has been growing resentment in England and Wales at the \u2018apartheid\u2019 between those living north and south of the border in areas such as healthcare and university fees. For instance, cancer drugs have been made available on the NHS in Scotland that are not prescribed elsewhere, meaning taxpayers in England and Wales are contributing to funding them, but not benefiting. The Scottish Parliament\u2019s new powers to cut air passenger duty could lead to air travellers and airports in the north of England being unfairly disadvantaged \u2013 and require targeted tax cuts, Mr Cameron will say. However, Scottish Nationalists are likely to accuse Mr Cameron of wanting Westminster to \u2018mark the Scottish Parliament\u2019s homework\u2019 every year. He will also be accused of seeking to stoke anti-Scottish sentiment in the rest of the UK \u2013 and throwing fuel on the fire of Scottish nationalism. The Tory manifesto promises to introduce a principle of \u2018English votes for English laws\u2019, meaning English MPs will be given a veto over legislation relating solely to England. Under Mr Cameron\u2019s latest plan, a formal assessment would be made by the Treasury and Cabinet Office each year of the impact of Scottish policies, including tax rates, business levies, university tuition fees and healthcare. Mr Cameron risks the wrath of Scottish National Party leader Nicola Sturgeon (pictured above) with his announcement . The Chancellor will tell MPs \u2018what action is needed to make sure there is no detriment to the rest of the country\u2019. The Prime Minister, on a campaign visit to the North West, will insist the plan will not stop the Scottish government taking the decisions it wants. \u2018In the Scottish referendum, we made a clear promise to devolve more powers to the Scottish Parliament,\u2019 Mr Cameron will say. \u2018After we won that referendum, we kept our promise, and agreement was reached \u2013 for the first time \u2013 between all five of Scotland\u2019s major parties to give the Scottish Parliament extensive new powers. \u2018But as we go further in devolving powers to Scotland, we need to make sure devolution works for all the other all parts of this country too. \u2018Today I want to set out a new principle \u2013 you could call it the Carlisle Principle \u2013 that we will make sure that there are no unforeseen detrimental consequences to the rest of the country from Scottish devolution.\u2019 Boris Johnson and Sir John Major will enter the election fray this week as the Tories try to bolster their campaign. Sir John will warn of the dangers of a Labour-SNP government. The ex-premier could be deployed to speak as early as tomorrow. Later in the week, David Cameron is due to make a first high-profile campaign appearance with Mr Johnson. There are growing calls from Tory MPs for the London mayor to be \u2018weaponised\u2019. David Cameron has revealed he is locked in a high stakes battle: over ear-piercing. While contesting a general election campaign, he is also in a 'fight' with eldest daughter Nancy about when she can have her ears pierced. The Prime Minister also admitted he does not want his children to follow wife Samantha in having tattoo. In an interview with the Sun, Mr Cameron said his children 'take the mickey out of me daily', including mocking his TV and music choices. 'To them I'm just a normal dad, who they think is a bit square and sometimes embarrassing. It's very sobering to come home to after a day in the office,' he said. 'They rib me about, you know, anything from my CD collection to what I watch on TV.' Nancy is due to start secondary school in September, and wants to have her ears pierced. Mr Cameron said: 'I'm in that fight with Nancy at the moment. We'll probably reach an agreement over what age she can have them done. We're in negotiations.' His wife Samantha has a small tattoo of a dolphin on her right ankle, which she had done while travelling as a student. She has said it would 'fine' if her children copied her. But Mr Cameron said: 'I'm not a big fan. I love Samantha's tattoo, it's very small, very discreet. But I'd be a square dad and tell the children to think very carefully about it.'\n"]}

The pensioner, 71, has been collecting royal-themed knick-knacks for more than 40 years and now boasts a collection worth \u00a310,000. But squeezing it all into her small terraced home hasn't been easy and her gargantuan collection now fills four whole rooms, including one dedicated to Princess Diana alone. Scroll down for video . Passionate: Margaret Tyler, 71, has amassed a vast collection of royal memorabilia . Despite having a home that quite literally bursts with items, Mrs Tyler, a mother-of-four, says she has no plans to stop collecting and describes it as 'a labour of love'. 'There's loads of royal magazines that I read, so I get up at about 4.30am to keep up with it all,' she reveals. 'I'm retired but I don't think I've actually ever worked so hard in my life. It takes a lot of work [to maintain] but it's a labour of love.' As well as collecting royal memorabilia, Mrs Tyler, a retired charity worker, is also obsessed with meeting the real thing and says she spent six days outside the Lindo Wing at St. Mary's Hospital in London when Prince George was born. 'I was there for six days,' she beams. '[My son] Andrew was born at St. Mary's and I was only there for two days. 'I just wanted to feel close to them [William and Kate], I suppose. I spent the time meeting people, and chatting.I was convinced it was going to be a girl, but it wasn't.' Extensive: Her collection includes china, a solar powered Queen and thousands of photos . Got it! A copy of the Duchess of Cambridge's \u00a3450 Issa engagement dress is in the collection . Although Mrs Tyler, who considers the Royal Family and extension of her own, didn't shake hands with the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge on that occasion, she has met a number of senior royals, among them the Queen. 'I've met a lot of them,' she reveals. 'I've met the Queen, I've met Prince Andrew and Prince Charles so I've been very lucky.' But despite considering herself lucky to have met so many royals, it is collecting that is her real passion and she has amassed around 10,000 items over 40 years. These are stored in four rooms, each with a different royal theme. Her drawing room is devoted to the Queen, while another, known as the Sandringham Room, has been turned into a \u00a375-a-night B&B for royal enthusiasts. Her front room contains items created for every royal event in the past century, among them the 1953 Coronation and the 2012 Diamond Jubilee, while another space, dubbed 'the Memorial Room' is devoted exclusively to Princess Diana. Meeting: Mrs Tyler has met several members of the Royal Family including the Queen and Prince Charles . Favourite: Princess DIana remains one of Mrs Tyler's favourite royals and has an entire room to her name . Homage: Mrs Tyler in her Princess Diana room. Her favourite painting is seen on the back wall (centre) Inside are some of her most prized possessions, among them a Diana handbag, a set of Diana-themed matrioshka dolls and a stained glass window that Mrs Tyler commissioned in 1998 - a year after the princess' death. The room also boasts a fresco of the late princess painted on the ceiling and a large oil painting of Diana with her sons William and Harry. 'I think that says it all about Diana,' she says of the painting. 'She was a mother first and foremost.' Nevertheless, items devoted to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall also occupy a considerable amount of the floor-space, as do the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. And while much of the collection might be made up of novelty items picked up at London markets, other items, such as a \u00a3450 Issa dress identical to the one worn by the Duchess of Cambridge for her engagement announcement, didn't come cheap. Despite the outlay and her rapidly diminishing space, Mrs Tyler says she will go on collecting royal memorabilia 'forever'. 'Enough is never enough,' she beams. 'It's an ongoing story isn't it? When William and Catherine's baby is born, it will be the Queen's fifth great-grandchild. 'It doesn't stop dead. You can't pretend that life isn't going on for them. Anyway, I just love it! Not even the dusting gets me down.'\n"]}

With furious demonstrations going on below him in the capital Delhi, Ganjendra Singh, 41, was seen sitting in the tree for some time before throwing a suicide note into the crowd. Seconds later he hanged himself with a white scarf and - despite the best efforts of rally organisers who climbed the tree to untie him - was later declared dead at\u00a0Ram Manohar Lohia hospital. The demonstrations were organised by members of the Aam Aadmi political party, including Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal. They came in for harsh criticism after the protests were allowed to continue, despite Mr Singh's death. Tragic: Ganjendra Singh, 41, hanged himself from a tree in the middle of a public protest over land rights after telling onlookers he could no longer afford to feed his three children . Horror: With furious demonstrations going on below him in the capital Delhi, Ganjendra Singh was seen sitting in the tree for some time before throwing a suicide note into the crowd . Before taking his own life, Mr Singh through a suicide note into the crowd gathered below. 'I am the son of a farmer. He threw me out of home because of damage to the crop. I have three children. I don't have the money to feed my children. Hence, I want to commit suicide,' it read. Police said Mr Singh was originally from Dausa, a town in western Rajasthan state. The Aam Admi Party organized the rally, attended by nearly 1,500 people, opposing changes to the Land Acquisition Act introduced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government. Critics say the changes would make it easier for businesses and the government to buy land and that may disadvantage farmers. However it is believed Mr Singh's crops were devastated by unseasonable rain and hailstorms in March that destroyed large areas of farmland in northern and western India and has led to dozens of debt-ridden farmers killing themselves.

The storm subsided before daybreak but left extensive damage to the winter wheat crop in its wake. Nitish Kumar, Bihar's top elected official, said the storm also damaged mango and lychee crops. During the protest hours later Mr Singh climbed a tree in the Indian capital Delhi and hanged himself with a rope.

The Harry Potter star reached a quarter of a century yesterday, celebrating what must arguably be one of the recognisable A-lister names on the planet. Now\u00a0renowned\u00a0for her effortless style and influential role in women's right movements, Emma has come a long way from her frizzy-haired days as Harry Potter's loyal companion. Scroll down for video . Emma Watson turns 25 and has already carved a career that many of us can only dream of . But how has the actress made the transition from Hermione Granger to a feminist heroine? Here, FEMAIL charts her 14 years in the spotlight that have made her a global icon. 2001 . Emma was placed firmly in the global spotlight after taking on one of the world's most famous roles. Aged just 11, she joined the cast of Harry Potter And The Philosopher's Stone as the geeky but loyal Hermione Granger. Alongside Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, she was catapulted to fame after the adaption of the JK Rowling book grossed at $317m (\u00a3214m) worldwide. Emma's career began when she landed the roll of Hermione Granger alongside Daniel Radcliffe (centre) and Rupert Grint (right) who play Daniel Radcliffe and Ron Weasley in the Harry Potter saga . Emma was just 11 when she filmed Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone. She is pictured here bright-eyed at her first ever premier for the first film . 2002 . A year later saw the release of the second film in the series - Harry Potter And The Chamber Of Secrets which saw Harry Potter and Ron Weasley go it alone after Emma's character Hermione is petrified by a giant snake known as the Basilisk. Critics criticised the director Chris Columbus for under-employing Emma's talents in the film. After her appearance in the second Harry Potter flick critics criticised the director for underplaying Emma . 2004 . In the third installment of the Harry Potter series, Hermione took a more prominent role, aiding Harry in restoring peace in Hogwarts, travelling back in time. The actress earned kudos for her powerful female role after she famously punched the gang's arch Nemesis Draco Malfoy, which the actor Tom Felton described as 'hardcore'. The film also sees her famous frizz take some taming, as her hair appears softer and more tamed. 2005 . As Harry Potter And The Goblet Of Fire was released, Emma was recognised as an individual. She received a Bronze Otto Award for her performance and, after her Yule Ball costume sent many teenage boys' hearts a flutter, she landed a cover on Teen Vogue magazine. Hermione takes a much bigger role in Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban . Emma won over the hearts of many teenage boys when she was transformed from a girl to a woman at the Yule Ball in Harry Potter And Yhe Goblet Of Fire . Emma may be an on-screen siren however she was still finding her fashion feet in 2005 . 2007 . In the fifth film - Harry Potter And The Order Of The Phoenix - we also begin to get a sense of her worth, with her earnings so far estimated to be \u00a310m. This year also sees Emma branch out from her role as Hermione, taking the lead in the BBC production of Ballet Shoes based on the novel by Noel Streatfeild, which was aired over Christmas. It was also this year Emma considered leaving the Harry Potter franchise. When she was asked to renew her contract that she had been presented with at the tender age of nine, she wanted to give it serious thought after she said her life had become out of her control. 'I get told what time I can eat, when I have time to go to the bathroom. Every single second of my day is not in my power,' she said at the time. Eventually at the age of 16, she signed up for another five years with Warner Brothers. Emma's hair took a bleach blonde tone in 2007 following her appearance in the fifth Potter film . The BBC adaptation of Ballet Shoes was the first non-Potter role for Emma Watson aged 16 . 2008 . It was a role in which we heard Emma, but didn't see her as the actress voiced the role of Princess Pea in the animated film The Tale Of Desperaux. It was her first - and only - animated film to date. 2009 . In March 2009, Emma was named in sixth place on the Forbes list of the Most Valuable Young Stars. She was also named\u00a0Hollywood's highest paid female star\u00a0having\u00a0earned\u00a0an estimated \u00a319m aged just 19. In 2009 both Emma and her brother Alex (left) took centre stage in the Burberry campaign . It was to be the first of several modelling jobs for the actress . Emma took on her first modelling job in 2009, appearing in the AW09 campaign images for Burberry alongside her brother Alex. She also appeared in the brand imagery a year later for the AW10 campaign. As if she didn't have enough on her plate, Emma also embarked on her degree at Brown's University in USA, but shortly after dropped out in order to continue filming\u00a0Harry Potter And The Half Blood Prince which was released that year. 2010 . In the penultimate Potter flick, Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1, we see the trio step away from Hogwarts for the first time. The film was split into two parts for financial reasons. Emma became a regular at fashion week taking to the front row and brushing shoulders with stars. Pictured: Emma at the Burberry SS10 show with Gwyneth Paltrow and Mario Testino . Emma made headlines when she debuted a cropped haircut at the premier of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1, a far cry from Hermione's bushy waves . After getting a taste for fashion as a Burberry model, Emma was seen on the catwalks of several Fashion Week shows. She took front row at the Burberry catwalk in London where she was sat with Gwyneth Platrow and Vogue photographer Mario Testino. At the World Premier of Harry Potter, the actress showcased her desire to disassociate herself with Hermione when she debuted her cropped haircut. 2011 . This year saw the end of Hermione Granger for Emma after the release of the final film Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2. Despite her previous gripes with the movies, Emma was moved to tears at the world premiere of the last instalment, which marked the end of 10 years of filming. 2011 saw the final instalment of Harry Potter and Emma was moved to tears at the world premiere . Emma grew as one to watch in the fashion industry when she was awarded Style Icon at the Elle Style Awards . After having waved goodbye to the Potter franchise, Emma picked up a new role as Lucy, a wardrobe assistant in My Week With Marilyn. Emma's style efforts were further acknowledged when the actress took home the Style Icon award at the ELLE Style Awards. Emma also returned to her studies at Oxford University before having to put her studies on hold in order to film. Her first post Potter role came when she acted alongside Eddie Redmayne in My Week With Marilyn . In 2012 Emma abandoned her English Rose status as she adopted an American accent to play Sam, a glamorous high school student in The Perks Of Being AWallflower . 2012 . Emma took a complete turnaround from her famous English schoolgirl role as she adopted an American accent in The Perks Of Being A Wallflower, in which she played Sam in the adaption of\u00a0Stephen Chbosky's novel. 2013 . Emma took on her most unrecognisable role yet, playing the pot-smoking underage drinking Nikki in The Bling Ring, based on the true events of teenagers in LA who burgled from the homes of Hollywood A-listers. In a bizarre turn of events, Emma appeared in a cameo role as a more exaggerated version of herself along side Seth Rogan and James Franco, in the post apocalyptic film where she famously used a four letter swearword. Emma's role in The Bling Ring saw her go from British school girl to LA socialite in 2013 . 2014 . Emma proved she had brains as well as beauty when she graduated from Brown University with a degree in English Literature, after commencing her degree five years earlier. Additionally, Emma took on the role of Ila in Noah where she played the girlfriend of Noah's son, starring alongside Russell Crowe and Douglas Booth. But by far the most applauded achievement that Emma gained in 2014 was for her role as a UN Goodwill Ambassador for Women. In early 2014 Emma graduated from Brown's University with a degree in English Literature . The speech that she gave in\u00a0New York made waves around the world and paved the way for her to continue her work as ambassador. The Paris-born actress launched her HeForShe follows feminism's principles of striving for equal rights and opportunities for men and women, including the political, economic and social equality of the sexes. But it aims to repackage the concept without emphasis on oppression by the male sex. In fact Emma formally invited men - who may have previously felt alienated from the movement - to play a greater role in ending gender inequality. Emma was applauded by feminists as she launched the HeForShe campaign as part of her work as the UN Goodwill Ambassador for women . She addressed the United Nations in New York and called for the support of men in women's rights rather than the oppression of the male sex . The campaign attracted a celebrity following with Simon Pegg and Joseph Gordon Levitt and seeing the star recognised for something other than her role as the bushy haired Hermione. 2015 . Emma has a busy year ahead. September will see the release of her latest flick Colonia in which she plays a woman in search of her boyfriend who was abducted in Seventies Chile. She will also begin filming perhaps her most magical role yet as Belle in the live-action remake of Disney's Beauty And The Beast.\n"]}

The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) took action against the supermarket company last year after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge placed on transactions made using tap and go contactless payment systems in any of its stores. ASIC also found that ALDI failed to disclose the 0.5 percent surcharge it charges consumers paying by credit card in some of its stores. Scroll down for video . Discount supermarket Aldi is under fire for failing to notify customers of a 0.5 percent surcharge on credit card fees six months after it promised the corporate regulator it would . Aldi told the regulator it would put up signs at the entrance of stores and at registers to notify shoppers of the surcharge, as well as have cashiers inform customers before payments were made. But Fairfax Media\u00a0reports that Aldi has not consistently disclosed the surcharge to customers and many were unaware about the additional fees. Some stores still do not have signs at entrances and signs at the registers warning of the surcharge are in tiny print. A spokeswoman for the supermarket said Aldi had carried out an audit last year to make sure appropriate signs were visible. 'If for any reason an Aldi store does not have the required signage, we will ensure that this is corrected immediately,' she said. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission took action against Aldi last year after an investigation revealed it did not disclose a 0.5 percent surcharge on transactions made using tap and go . Some stores still do not have signs at entrances and signs at the registers warning of the surcharge are in tiny print . Under the ASIC Act, retailers that fail to adequately disclose surcharges, or create the impression that surcharges do not apply, may be considered 'misleading or deceptive'. ASIC Deputy Chairman Peter Kell said retailers needed to disclose credit card surcharges. 'Merchants need to be transparent about fees and charges where credit card surcharges apply so that consumers can consider using other payment methods without any additional costs,' Mr Kell said. 'Consumers should also be mindful that payments by contactless or 'tap and go' cards are currently treated as credit card transactions, meaning that fees may apply where there are surcharges in place, even where they are using a debit card.' In ALDI stores all credit card transactions and all tap and go payments attract the 0.5 percent surcharge, irrespective of whether customers use a debit or credit card. An ALDI spokeswoman said it has always charged credit card surcharges to 'cover the costs associated with the service'. 'ALDI is aware there are high costs associated with accepting credit cards,' she said. Aldi told the regulator it would put up signs at the entrance of stores and at registers to notify shoppers of the surcharge, as well as have cashiers inform customers before payments were made . 'However, rather than inflating prices across the board, to compensate for the credit card acceptance costs, ALDI prefers customers to make the choice themselves.' Tom Godfrey, spokesman for consumer group Choice, said many shoppers were unclear about the charges that can come with using tap and go. 'Most people don't realise that tap and go relates to credit so obviously if you're using a credit facility surcharges can come with that,' Mr Godfrey said. 'What we take issue with is whether the surcharge is at a reasonable level, and what we have seen is excessive surcharges going on. 'The surcharge at ALDI is not excessive, but I don't think it's great they're charging a surcharge on a debit facility, so people's savings accounts.' Mr Godrey said shoppers needed to ask about surcharges before using tap and go. 'I think it's always important to ask - as you've seen with ALDI, you might assume there isn't a surcharge because Coles and Woolies don't have one,' Mr Godfrey said. 'If you're going to use tap and go you should ask what the surcharge will be, then ask for a surcharge free option.'\n"]}
{"question_id": 482, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: It seems an accepted trend that Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas struggles during the second half of the season and the Spanish midfielder was one of the worst players on the pitch again in his country's 2-0 defeat by Holland on Tuesday. The 27-year-old spoke of his happiness in south west London earlier this week but his form has significantly dipped from that of the player who, around Christmas, looked a dead-cert to break the Barclays Premier League record for assists. On Tuesday - his first international appearance since October - he was given just four out of 10 by one Spanish newspaper and while his season is likely to end in success with the Premier League title following a Capital One Cup win, questions remain about Fabregas' durability. Cesc Fabregas (right) captained Spain on Tuesday but his poor form continued as they lost 2-0 in Holland . The Chelsea midfielder struggled to make an impact in midfield as the European champions fell to defeat . After a brilliant start to the season at Stamford Bridge, the Spaniard's form has dropped off somewhat of late . 'I'm playing almost every minute of every match (with Chelsea) and that's what makes me happy,' he said this week. But a long, intense campaign on his return to England is taking its toll on the Spaniard. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho will have been concerned to see his player toiling in midfield for the full 90 minutes at the Amsterdam ArenA, adding to the fatigue that seems to have seen his role as a key man in the Blues' title charge decline of late. Fabregas captained the European champions in the Dutch capital but struggled to make any real impact against Manchester United's Daley Blind or goalscorer\u00a0Davy Klaassen. Jose Mourinho will be demanding more from his deep-lying playmaker in the Premier League run-in . Diego Costa and Fabregas enjoyed a great start together and linked up again in Chelsea's 3-2 win at Hull City . Fabregas was brilliant for Chelsea in their big win away at Swansea City in January but has struggled since . After his \u00a330million transfer to Chelsea last summer, Fabregas' former club Barcelona released a statement that pointed at his traditional post-Christmas slump. 'There has been a downward trend in his stats every season at the club,' it read. 'Despite glowing starts to each campaign, Cesc's contributions to the cause gradually decreased as each season drew to a close. 'From being someone who joined in with the attack, supplying and scoring goals, the magic tended to fade later on in each season.' And it seems to have rung true on the stats front. Having picked up 15 Premier League assists by mid-January, he has just one in five games he has played since, and just four in 15 appearances for club and country in 2015. Thierry Henry's record of 20 had looked almost certain to fall but given his current form, Fabregas is now on track to fall just short. However, with nine games to play Chelsea are still to face six opponents who their key man in midfield has laid on goals against. Fabregas' former team-mate Thierry Henry (right) holds the record for assists in a Premier League season . Henry managed 20 assists in the 2002-03 season and Fabregas looked set to beat that haul before his slump . When he left Barcelona, the  club commented on Fabregas' unwanted reputation for a late-season slump . Their opponents on Saturday, Stoke City, as well as Queens Park Rangers, Manchester United, Arsenal, Leicester City and West Bromwich Albion have all been opened up by Fabregas' passing ability this season, while he scored in Chelsea's 2-0 win over Crystal Palace in October. The personal accolade will be important to the midfielder, but more key is the boost it could give to his club. Chelsea could need as many as six wins from their remaining nine games, and if Fabregas finds form again the Premier League title could be wrapped up within weeks. Mourinho will hope his assist for Diego Costa in Chelsea's last game against Hull City is a sign of a late-season resurgence to prove any doubters wrong. Fabregas laid on an assist for Costa in Chelsea's 3-2 win over Hull City, but that was his first in five games . Mourinho is looking to guide his team over the line in the Premier League title race, with Fabregas a key cog .\n"]}

Decades of cheap package holidays mean that thousands of retired people every year are paying with their health for sunburn they experienced in their youth. According to Cancer Research UK, men aged 65 and over are around ten times more likely to be diagnosed with malignant melanoma than those of their parents\u2019 generation. Scroll down for video . Pensioners are seven times more likely to develop serious skin cancer today than they were 40 years ago, research shows . And older women are about five times more likely to develop this disease than someone of the same age were in the mid-1970s. Around 5,700 pensioners are now diagnosed with melanoma each year in the UK compared with just 600 a year four decades ago. Many of the patients being diagnosed today suffered cancer-causing sunburn when they were young, experts said last night. Although age is a major risk factor for melanoma, the huge increase is blamed on the cheap package holiday boom dating from the 1960s. Overall, 55.2 of every 100,000 people aged over 65 are diagnosed with skin cancer every year. In 1975 just 7.9 per 100,000 were diagnosed - a seven-fold increase. The figures are part of a worrying increase in incidents that affects all age groups. The continuing obsession with sporting a tan means the toll is likely to keep rising. Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person\u2019s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest . Getting sunburnt once every two years can triple a person\u2019s risk of developing the disease, scientists suggest. Around 13,300 people across a wide range of ages are diagnosed with malignant melanoma in the UK each year making it the country\u2019s fifth most common cancer overall and the second most common cancer in young adults aged 15 to 34. And with sunbeds still very popular, the number of diagnoses is expected to rise to 20,000 a year by 2027. In 1975 the figure was just 1,800. Professor Richard Marais, Cancer Research UK\u2019s skin cancer expert: \u2018It\u2019s worrying to see melanoma rates increasing at such a fast pace, and across all age groups. \u2018It\u2019s very important for people to take care of their skin in the sun. \u2018It\u2019s also important for them to keep an eye on their skin and seek medical opinion if they see any changes to their moles, or even to normal areas of skin. \u2018Melanoma is often detected on men\u2019s backs and women\u2019s legs but can appear on any part of the body.\u2019 Each year, 2,100 Britons die from the disease. Dr Julie Sharp, Cancer Research UK\u2019s head of health information, said: \u2018Many cases of malignant melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, are preventable by taking precautions in the sun and making sure you don\u2019t burn. \u2018Sun damage accumulates over time so avoiding sunburn - and sunbeds - is key, as well as getting to know your skin type so you don\u2019t overdo it on the beach or even in the garden. \u2018You can burn at home just as easily as you can on holiday, so remember to spend time in the shade, wear a T shirt and a hat to protect your skin and regularly apply sunscreen that is at least Factor 15 and has four stars. \u2018Swapping bad sun habits for good ones could save your life.\u2019 Sue Deans, a 69-year-old retired teacher and mother-of-three from Croydon, south London, who was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in 2000 after having a mole removed, said: \u2018I was part of the generation where package holidays became affordable and you could go abroad nearly every year. \u2018I don\u2019t think there was much understanding at the time about the impact that too much sun can have on your risk of getting skin cancer. \u2018And I loved the sun but suffered quite a bit of sunburn over the years. \u2018I\u2019ve always been quite body aware so my cancer was spotted early. \u2018I had successful surgery and have been healthy since, but I\u2019m always vigilant in keeping an eye out for anything unusual or persistent that might need to be checked. \u2018Now I make sure my grandson knows the dangers of getting caught out in the sun.\u2019\n"]}

Professor Will Stewart, a Fellow of The Institution of Engineering and Technology in London, told MailOnline that the walking globe is easy to achieve \u2013 \u2018we could build one if we had the budget\u2019. \u2018It\u2019s related to the default egg-race-style self-propelled double wheel device or the walk-in-balloon which anyone can try,\u2019 he said, referring to a zorb, which humans walk inside and push against the side to move along. But the real mystery is how the robot\u2019s head can move independently but stay on top of the free-rolling ball. It\u2019s possible that magnets are involved to \u2018stick\u2019 the droid\u2019s head to its body, but it would require remarkable control by a human operator to make sure it\u2019s head stayed on top of the body \u2013 and the stage performance seemed effortlessness.

It's currently a mystery as to how BB-8 moves, but its white and orange case may hide a larger mechanism like that found in Sphero, which allows it to move quickly in any direction. The real question is how its head stays on . BB-8\u2019s body is a spherical ball that allows it to move in any direction, but it also has a completely free-moving head that doesn\u2019t fall off, leaving applauding spectators wondering how it works. This image shows the robot on the set of the film, which will be released in the UK in December . It may be able to stay upright easily by depending on a gyroscope that tells it which way is up and use an accelerometer to monitor motion, much like many smartphone games. Magnets may still be used to keep the head in contact with the body. Professor Stewart said:\u00a0\u2018The floating \u2018head\u2019 is probably on rollers magnetically bound through the plastic ball to the \"driving\" robot inside.\u2019 He explained that rare earth magnets are very strong and light and the robot\u2019s \u2018movements are consistent with this, such as a tendency to move in the direction of travel.\u2019 \u2018The inside and head could be wirelessly linked but given that this robot is radio controlled rather than autonomous\u2026I suspect that head and body are just independently radio controlled.\u2019 It\u2019s possible that magnets are involved to \u2018stick\u2019 the droid\u2019s head to its body (pictured), but it would require remarkable control by a human operator to make sure it\u2019s head stayed on top of the body \u2013 and the stage performance seemed effortlessness .

Sphero is the world's first robotic toy ball that's controlled by a smartphone app. It's been suggested that BB-8 may use similar technology in its body. The Sphero toy can be programmed to weave in between objects, follow augmented reality race tracks and even keep a pet entertained. The 2.8-inch (73mm) ball travels up to 5mph (0.6 km/h), is fully waterproof and costs $99.99 in the U.S, and \u00a399.99 in the UK. Sphero (pictured) is the world's first robotic toy ball that's controlled by a smartphone app . The gadget weighs 178g (0.4lbs) and has a gyroscope and accelerometer inside that connect to a tablet or smartphone via Bluetooth, as well as two rubber wheels. A counterweight gets the ball rolling on demand and sensors allow users to control the direction and speed of the ball. The wheels inside work like a hamster running inside a ball and never leave Sphero's surface, so it can turn corners at high speed. There are up to 30 games available via apps including driving, sports and arcade games, and the polycarbonate ball could soon be on its way to school classrooms to give children an insight into robotics. It is hoped the waterproof ball will inspire a future generation to get involved in computer science and design and technology.\n"]}

Here's how it's unfolding: . It started at 3:16 a.m. Pacific Daylight Time, when the moon began moving into Earth's shadow.  For the next hour and 45 minutes, that shadow will move across the moon and engulf it at 4:58 a.m. Pacific Time. The total eclipse will only last four minutes and 43 seconds, and NASA says that makes it the shortest one of the century. Watch it live on NASA TV . While people west of the Mississippi River will have the best view, at least a partial eclipse will be visible across the nation. But sunrise will interrupt the show on the East Coast. Parts of South America, India, China and Russia also will be able to see the eclipse, but it won't be visible in Greenland, Iceland, Europe, Africa or the Middle East. A lunar eclipse happens when the sun, Earth and moon form a straight line in space, with the Earth smack in the middle. The sun shines on the Earth and creates a shadow. As the moon moves deeper into that shadow, it appears to turn dark and may even appear to be a reddish color.  Why red? Because Earth's atmosphere is filtering out most of the blue light. Some people have nicknamed the effect the \"blood moon.\" NASA says lunar eclipses typically happen at least twice a year, but this eclipse is the third in a series of four in a row, known as a \"tetrad.\"  The first was on April 15, 2014. The second was in September 2014, the next is Saturday and there will be one more, on September 28.

It sounds idyllic, but perhaps is not the way you might imagine Ian Poulter prepares to win the Masters. But Poulter promises this break, just weeks before the first major of the year, means he will be fit and fresh for his latest assault on Augusta National. The downtime ensured plenty of opportunity to dream about feeling that green jacket draped over his shoulders, and what meal he would choose for the champion\u2019s dinner the following year. Not that he needs to think too hard about that last bit. \u2018I hate tempting fate,\u2019 he says while reclining on a lounger in his luxury holiday apartment in New Providence. \u2018But I know exactly what my jacket measurements are and I know exactly what [dinner] I would choose. But I\u2019m not telling you!\u2019 Ian Poulter  lines up his putt for birdie on the 18th hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . These are certainly not the words of a man who feels he is taking things too easy in the build-up to the most eagerly-anticipated week of the golfing year. \u2018I\u2019ve tried every type of formula,\u2019 he says. \u2018I\u2019ve had two weeks off before; I\u2019ve played [tournaments] during the run-in; I\u2019ve tried going to Augusta several days before Masters week to get some extra prep in. I\u2019ve tried everything but nothing\u2019s worked.\u2019 So this year Poulter, who has two top 10 finish at the Masters in his 10 attempts, has simply said to hell with it, let\u2019s have some fun. Family comes first, practice comes second. Sharing his holiday with the world on Twitter comes third, of course. Poulter celebrates  during the fourball match on the second day of the Ryder Cup golf tournament . By now, however, the serious work has begun. Some of his time in the Bahamas was spent on the range, before the workload was ramped up last week. The Ryder Cup defines Poulter, gets his juices flowing, his eyes and veins popping like nothing else. But he lives for the annual trip down Magnolia Lane. \u2018The electricity, the tension, the buzz\u2019 of Masters week give him goosebumps. He admits to a \u2018love affair\u2019 with the place and its storied history. Only the Open Championship can compete with the Masters for his affections and ambitions. But at the age of 39, and with Rory McIlroy leading a new breed of power hitters ready to clean up the majors, Poulter knows he will not get too many more chances of claiming either prize. Poulter plays into the 13th green during the final round of the 2014 Turkish Airlines Open . So, if push came to shove, would he take a green jacket over a claret jug? \u2018That\u2019s a very unfair question,\u2019 he says. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t take it. Because I think I\u2019ll win a claret jug, and I think I\u2019ll win a green jacket. And I\u2019m quite happy to put my neck on the line.\u2019 In a flash, there is the mentality that has vanquished many an American dream. Despite Poulter\u2019s Ryder Cup heroics, he has still never won a strokeplay event on US soil. He came close to victory in the Honda Classic last month but a final-round collapse featuring five balls in the water extended that duck. Yet the lion-hearted Englishman believes he will still claim the game\u2019s two biggest prizes. Poulter admits the prospect of retiring without a major victory would leave him unfulfilled. But he has already written his rags-to-riches story, from assistant club professional in Hertfordshire to super-rich superstar in Florida. He knows he will be able to reflect one day on an extraordinary career. English golfer Poulter admits retiring without a major victory would leave him unfulfilled . \u2018Yeah I\u2019d feel incomplete [without a major] but I\u2019d feel very content living the rest of my life knowing that I gave it a good go. It wouldn\u2019t stop me sleeping at night, I can certainly say that much. I want to win, I\u2019m passionate about winning, that\u2019s what keeps me going. But if it doesn\u2019t happen, it doesn\u2019t happen. I\u2019m working very hard and if guys beat me fair and square then that\u2019s fine.\u2019 Two top-10 finishes at Augusta in the last five years suggests there will not be too many who can be confident of beating Poulter next week. He admits, however, that the \u2018truly remarkable\u2019 McIlroy could be one of them. Going for the career grand slam at the age of 25 is simply \u2018incredible\u2019, but even if this is not the week that feat is achieved, Poulter insists the Northern Irishman is already the equal of Gene Sarazen, Ben Hogan, Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player and Tiger Woods. Poulter smiles during practice ahead of the 2014 Ryder Cup on the PGA Centenary course at  Gleneagles . \u2018We knew years ago when he burst on to the scene this kid was going to be good,\u2019 he says. \u2018We didn\u2019t know how good. It happens every decade or couple of decades that someone comes along, gets inspired, works incredibly hard, is very dedicated, and proves that anything is possible. \u2018Rory is one of those kids who has the natural talent, work ethic and is impressive to watch. When he\u2019s on form he\u2019s as good as anybody has ever been.\u2019 But for all the effusive praise, Poulter rates Bubba Watson as the man to beat this year, not McIlroy. Rory McIlroy  hits his tee shot on the third hole during the first round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational . The defending champion will be chasing his third Masters win in four years and Poulter reckons the huge-hitting left-hander\u2019s game is so well suited to Augusta, even the world No 1 might not be able to match him. Six left-handed winners in the last 12 years \u2014 Mike Weir, Phil Mickelson (three times) and Watson (twice) \u2014 is clearly playing on Poulter\u2019s mind. He would not be alone among the players in wondering how they can compete on what Poulter admits is a \u2018bomber\u2019s course\u2019. Still, is Bubba really the man to beat, rather than Rory? \u2018For sure. Absolutely. He hits it long, he hits a nice cut off every tee. When you hit it 340 yards with a slight cut, I\u2019d like to play that golf course. Yeah, I think he\u2019s the favourite.\u2019 So how can Poulter compete with Watson, McIlroy and the other monster hitters? \u2018That course lends itself to a cut, or if you\u2019re a right-hander a draw. We all know that before we get there. It\u2019s a case of practising certain shots. There are some key holes round there which a draw will favour, or a cut of you\u2019re a left-hander. We all know it, we just have to work on it. \u2018I have to stick to my game plan. I can\u2019t hit it 340, I\u2019ll try to get it out there at 300 and provided my short game and wedge game is very, very good and my putting is good then I\u2019ll definitely have a chance come Sunday.\u2019 If that plan comes to fruition, there\u2019s a fair chance Poulter might spend more than just one week living it up in the Bahamas. He\u2019d richly deserve it, too. And he wouldn\u2019t even have to spend time worrying about what he\u2019d choose for the champions dinner in 2016.

It wasn't the most romantic setting -- a study group for calculus-based physics -- but Ben managed to turn it into a story worth telling by cheating. \"I set up a study group and ended up telling the other people not to come so it would be just the two of us,\" said Ben with a smile. \"He was sneaky,\" says Shelby. \"Yeah, I wanted to meet her,\" says Ben, \"and that was the best way I could figure out.\" Fast-forward eight years to 2014. Ben, now 34, and Shelby, a newly minted 30-year-old, were married and raising little Maeve, 3, and baby Hazel, 3 months, in Caledonia, Michigan, when life suddenly turns upside down. \"I thought it was sciatica,\" Shelby says of the back pain and the \"odd\" feeling that prompted her to go to the hospital. \"But I couldn't get the doctors in the ER to pay attention. So I went back the next day and told them that I was incontinent, and they did an MRI and there it was.\" \"It\" turned out to be an intramedullary glioblastoma, a highly aggressive form of brain cancer. Shelby's version was extremely rare because it was lodged in her spine instead of her brain. \"So it's actually tangled into the spinal cord itself,\" Ben explains. \"If you'd imagine a meatball inside of bunch of spaghetti, you can't just easily take it out without damaging a bunch of the spinal cord itself.\" Surgery removed 75%. The rest was treated with a combination of oral chemo and radiation. But suddenly a second spot above the first grew worse and the area of radiation had to be broadened. After a week of treatment, Shelby suddenly lost feeling in her legs. Unfortunately, the numbness became permanent. Before long, Shelby was paralyzed from the belly button down. But that didn't stop her fighting spirit or her sense of humor. Shelby nicknamed her tumors and decided to \"terminate\" them. \"You pronounce it as 'tumah tumah-nator,'\" Ben says. \"Like how Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it if he had a tumor.\" As Shelby continued to fight and improve, in August 2014, Ben got some terrible news. The Hodgkins lymphoma he had fought and battled into remission when he was 20 had reappeared. And it probably had been hiding in his body for a few years, making it extremely hard to overcome. \"I thought it was never a concern again,\" Ben says. \"The procedures I went through, having a bone marrow transplant, I thought there wouldn't be any issues. It's been over 15 years. It caught everyone completely off guard.\" Ben was slated for a clinical trial with an experimental drug, but his alkaline phosphate levels were too high to meet the requirements. With no other options in the Grand Rapids, Ann Arbor or Detroit areas, he is now on generalized chemotherapy, hoping it will force the cancer into remission so he can undergo a bone marrow transplant. Two donors have been found that are a perfect match, if the cancer will respond. \"As it goes on, they are saying it's getting harder and harder to treat,\" he says. \"It's just like a car picking up speed. Eventually you're going to have 5 million cells, it's just going to keep growing and growing.\" Suddenly, both parents were undergoing the nausea, fatigue and discomfort of chemotherapy while trying to raise two small children. \"Some days it does feel like a battle,\" Ben admits. \"The days you are feeling absolutely horrible you don't even want to get out of bed, but you know you have to because you have to take care of the girls or help Shelby. Some days it's just way tougher than others.\" Friends and family became critical to the family's success, taking over updates to the family's online journal, and running fundraisers for medical expenses and building supplies to make the house wheelchair-friendly. \"We'd had an amazing support group,\" Ben says. \"Shelby has friends from high school who will drop everything to help us out at a moment's notice. And the community, it's just amazing for people to help that much. \" \"Even outside of our community, people we don't even know,\" adds Shelby, wiping a tear from her eye. \"We've had care packages sent from Ireland, Sweden and Australia. It means a lot.\" This January came the worst news yet. Shelby's cancer, which had retreated from her spine, suddenly appeared in her brain. Three tumors. Inoperable. What is Shelby's reaction? \"I'm not giving up,\" she says. \"Ben and I have a long road ahead of us. We know it's going to be hard, but we're going to do it.\" \"For me it's just something that you have to do,\" Ben says. \"You have to fight it and you have to beat it because there is no option.\" Maeve, who is 4 years old now, and Hazel, 1, will have a home with Ben's brother if the worst is to happen, and friends are setting up fundraisers for the girls' education. But that's not the focus of Ben and Shelby's fight. They want to get well. \"Yeah, we have two little ladies we have to take care of,\" Shelby says, \"and lots of family and friends that care about us.\" \"She's not just doing it for herself, she's doing it for her whole family, especially her girls and her husband, Ben,\" said Jay Tomczak, Shelby's older brother. \"She's not going to ever give up. What we really need is hope.\" The Offrinks would like help finding clinical trials to address the rare cancers they are fighting, as well as access to cancer centers with more advanced techniques than are available in Michigan. \"We're going to get all of our information and would like to go to Harvard or Mayo (Clinic) or places where maybe they do have more experience, and act in a shorter time frame,\" Shelby says. \"If, right now, we can find two or three trials that maybe Shelby can get into, or a trial drug for me to try instead of the path I'm on right now, it could definitely benefit us,\" adds Ben. \"We just can't wait,\" Shelby says. Her prognosis is about six months, she says, and a year for her husband. \"Never give up, because there's no reason to. Just keep fighting,\" Shelby says. She breaks into tears: \"Especially when you have someone special to fight for and everyone has someone special to fight for -- there's no one who doesn't.\"\n"]}

Should Pep Guardiola's side go all the way and claim this season's title as European champions, Alonso will become only the second player to win European football's top trophy with three clubs having held it during his time at Liverpool and Real Madrid. The only other player to have done so is AC Milan legend Clarence Seedorf, who lifted the famous piece of silverware for Ajax, Real Madrid and Milan. Xabi Alonso could become only the second player to win the Champions League with three different teams . Alonso in action during Bayern Munich's 3-1 Champions League quarter-final defeat against Porto last week . It is quite an achievement, and one that the Spanish maestro recently admitted to thinking about. 'There is one player who has won three Champions Leagues with three different clubs: [Clarence] Seedorf. Of course it is in my mind. The end of my career is near,' Alonso told\u00a0The Telegraph. 'I don't have many years left but it is one of the targets. It is an individual target and it would be great to win the third one with a third club because the Champions League is special,' he added. Alonso won the Champions League in his first season at Liverpool when he scored the decisive equaliser in 2005. And last season he was part of Carlo Ancelotti's side to take the title, even though his yellow cards throughout the tournament meant he was forced to sit in the stands for the final win over Atletico Madrid.

At 33 and with a club as strong as Bayern on a two-year deal under Pep Guardiola, Alonso could even attempt to match Seedorf's total achievement. Thiago Motta could also equal Seedorf's record if he manages to earn a Champions League medal with Paris Saint-Germain, but the 32-year-old midfielder has his work cut-out as the Ligue 1 side trail to a 3-1 aggregate scoreline against Barcelona. Names to have retired with two Champions League medals while at two different teams include the likes of Deco with Porto (2004) and Barcelona (2006) and former Manchester United goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar who had been part of the 1995 Ajax squad before holding the trophy once again with the Red Devils.

Chris Blowes, was viciously attacked by what has been described as a ' massive monster', about 350 metres offshore near Right Point on the south-western side of Fishery Bay in Port Lincoln National Park, when he was attacked at 9.45am on Saturday. The 26-year-old is in a critical condition at the Royal Adelaide hospital after the horrifying moment which was witnessed by about a dozen other surfers who were in the water at the time and\u00a0believed the six-metre creature swam away with the surfer's leg and a surfboard in its jaw. Scroll down for video . Chris Blowes (pictured left) is fighting for his life after being mauled by a Great White shark in South Australia . Mr Blowes was taken to Port Lincoln hospital before being airlifted to Adelaide on Saturday . Mr Blowes' family have released a statement expressing their gratitude for all of the support and well wishes they have received during this traumatic time. 'Currently our sole focus is on our unified, unconditional support and belief towards Christopher\u2019s big fight he has ahead, and we ask that our privacy in being able to provide that is respected at this time,' the statement said. 'From the bottom of our hearts we wish to thank his inspirational mates who rescued him and got him to safety and all of the wonderful medical professionals both here in Adelaide and in Pt Lincoln who have attended to Christopher.' A Royal Adelaide hospital spokesman confirmed to Daily Mail Australia that Mr Blowes had lost a leg and was in a critical condition in intensive care. Onlookers have described the distressing moment they saw the surfer attacked by the predator. 'The shark came in and bit his leg off and the guys helped him in and carried him up the cliff,' said Glenn Lugg, who has been surfing in the area for 25 years. 'I was just watching the shark go out to the ocean with his board still attached. Obviously the shark still had his leg and he was still swimming around with it,' Mr Lugg told Adelaide Now. Friends have begun to send their love and support to Chris and his family on social media as he battles to stay alive following the horrendous incident . Concerned friends of Chris send their best wishes to him and his family . Friends have begun to send their love and support to Chris and his family on social media as he battles to stay alive following the horrendous incident. 'Thoughts are with Chris Blowes, family and friends. Get Well mate,' Daniel Gannon posted on Twitter. While Belinda Wicks posted on her Facebook page: 'Sending all my love and thoughts to Chris Blowes and family.' Mr Lugg was told to call an ambulance while his fellow surfers pulled Mr Blowes from the water, up the beach on a surfboard and into a car to take the 26-year-old to hospital. The shocked witness said the experience was 'pretty traumatic', but that everyone involved did a great job. A friend of Mr Blowes, Ty Swan, described the 26-year-old as a 'good bloke', and that he had been bitten in the middle of the thigh. Mr Swan placed a sign at the popular tourist beach to let others know of the attack. Another witness, who was surfing at the time, told Daily Mail Australia that 'there was blood everywhere'. The injured man was initially taken to Port Lincoln Hospital with life-threatening injuries but been been airlifted to Adelaide for further treatment. Shocked witnesses said after the attack, which took place at Fishery Bay, South Australia, the six-metre shark was seen swimming away with the surfer's leg in its mouth . The 26-year-old was airlifted to Adelaide for further treatment after he was bitten by a shark . Another man said those closest to the badly injured surfer acted quickly without any thought of danger to themselves. 'I was just watching the shark go out to the ocean with his board still attached,' another witness told the Sunday Mail. 'Obviously the shark still had his leg and he was still swimming around with it.' The man said even though he was 50 metres from the shark, he could see its 'massive' pectoral fin - and he had no doubts it was a great white shark, the most feared creature in the sea. However details of the type of shark and the man's injuries have not been released or confirmed. Mr Blowes is in a critical condition after the shark attack in Fishery Bay, Port Lincoln, in South Australia . Fishery Bay is on South Australia's west coast, which is about seven hours from Adelaide . Witnesses have described the horrifying moment that they saw Mr Blowes mauled by a Great White shark . After the shark victim had been brought ashore and carried up a slope to a parking area, he was loaded into a car. He remains in a critical condition after beign airlifted via a MedSTAR retrieval team to the Royal Adelaide Hospital for further treatment. Police were working with Fisheries officials, the local council and Surf Life Saving SA to post signs on the beach warning others promptly after the shark attack. The attack happened during conditions that police and marine experts have previously said are dangerous. The overcast conditions make it difficult for surfers to see sharks that might be in the area and it is believed that sharks often mistake humans for seals or dolphins. The incident comes after surfer Jake Heron managed to fight off a four metre Great White at the same beach 10 years ago which attacked him just 10 metres from shore by punching and kicking it . He escaped with 20 stitches in his arm and 40 stitches in his thigh. Jake Heron was mauled by a four-metre Great White in 2005 . Wildcatch Fisheries SA chairman Jonas Woolford said the number of shark sightings in the area had risen recently. 'There has been a number of sightings just recently actually at a number of locations along the coast near to Fishery Bay, just around the corner, the sightings have said that the sharks have been rather aggressive actually,' Mr Woolford told the ABC. 'It's been reported that there hasn't been many for about 10 or so weeks, so whether those ones that have been laying low are now coming back to the areas which they normally frequent and they may be rather hungry ... but yes, there has been more sightings around just recently.'\n"]}

{"question_id": 492, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)An Arizona police chief on Wednesday supported an officer's decision to drive his car into an armed suspect, saying that although the move could have killed the suspect, deadly force was justified. Video of the incident, recorded February 19 by the dashboard cameras of two Marana police cars, shows one of the cars running into a suspect with who had a rifle in the city about a half hour from Tucson. The suspect, 36-year-old Mario Valencia, survived and was hospitalized before being criminally charged. Marana police Chief Terry Rozema was asked Wednesday on CNN's \"New Day\" whether police were fortunate that Valencia didn't die. \"That very well may be ... that it's luck that he is still alive. The fact of the matter remains, though, deadly force was authorized,\" Rozema said. \"So if he ends up dying in that situation, (then) he ends up dying, and that's unfortunate, (but) that's not the desire of everybody,\" the chief added. The footage has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used. In one of the dashcam videos, an officer who was tailing a walking Valencia at slow speed reports over the radio that the suspect has fired one round in the air with a rifle he is accused of stealing that morning from a Walmart. Another patrol car zooms past, runs into the man from behind, then hits a short cinder block wall next to a driveway. Video from Officer Michael Rapiejko's camera shows Rapiejko's vehicle running into Valencia, with the windshield smashing as the car hits the wall. Police in Marana justified Rapiejko's actions. \"We don't know that if (Rapiejko) lets him go for another 10 seconds, (Valencia) doesn't take somebody out in the parking lot,\" Rozema said. \"And then we're answering some completely different questions: 'Why didn't you act sooner? ... This guy had a gun ... Why didn't you stop this guy before he shot my wife, before he shot my husband, before he shot my child?' \" The video has stirred debate about what type of force police should have used to detain the man. Valencia's attorney, Michelle Cohen-Metzger, told CNN on Tuesday that \"it is miraculous that my client isn't dead.\" \"Everything in the video seems to point towards an obvious excessive use of force, Cohen-Metzger said. Tucson Police Sgt. Pete Dugan told CNN that Valencia was involved in several incidents there the day he was struck. At 6:45 a.m. on February 19, Valencia allegedly robbed a 7-Eleven in Tucson with a metal object in his hand. Authorities said he was dressed only in his underwear. He was charged with theft. A little more than an hour later, police said, Valencia set a fire at a church for which he was charged with arson of an occupied structure. Just after that he entered a home and stole a car, police said. Authorities said he drove to a Walmart in Marana, where he allegedly stole a .30-30 rifle and ammunition. He fled the store with Walmart employees in pursuit. Police encountered him in a business park walking down the road. An officer told him several times to drop the rifle, Lt. Tim Brunenkant with Marana police said in an email containing a timeline of events. Valencia, police said, walked away from the officer, turned a corner and stopped. Valencia pointed the rifle at the officer then walked away again toward a Coca-Cola bottling plant and another business. \"As Mario Valencia briskly walked towards Sargent Controls (local manufacturer), Officer Michael Rapiejko uses his marked police car to stop the dangerous situation Mario Valencia created,\" Brunenkant wrote. Brunenkant also said by phone that before Rapiejko's encounter with Valencia, the suspect had pointed the rifle at his head multiple times and threatened suicide before fleeing. Rozema said that Valencia's firing of the weapon, his refusal to obey the first officer's commands to drop the gun and the pointing of the gun at the officer were key. \"And so you have another officer who sees and seizes an opportunity to end the threat and put an end to the situation,\" the chief said. Cohen-Metzger criticized the fact that Rapiejko hit Valencia from behind. \"My client's back was turned and the officer drove right into him,\" she said. \"It isn't that dissimilar to a police officer shooting a fleeing suspect in the back.\" CNN affiliate KOLD reported Valencia was in serious condition when he was taken to the hospital and was released into police custody two days later. Valencia faces 15 charges, including three counts of aggravated assault, three counts of armed robbery and possession of a deadly weapon by a prohibited possessor. Cohen-Metzger said he had a prior record. His next court appearance is May 18. He is in the Pima County Jail. Authorities said no charges have been brought against the officer.

Lorraine Cobourn cannot even handle bananas following the incident that left her with a broken hip. The 51-year-old had to leave her job as a Barclays bank clerk as a result of the injuries she suffered when the yellow taxi struck her in May last year. She has received two payouts and is now undergoing counselling to help her deal with the psychological damage she received - including a terrible fear of anything yellow. Lorraine Cobourn (pictured) cannot even handle bananas after being hit by a yellow taxi in May last year . Ms Cobourn, of Oakwood, Derby, said: 'It sounds crazy I know, but I can't even touch bananas unless they're wrapped in cellophane - and I only ever buy green ones. 'I can't look at yellow number plates either. And If something yellow comes into the corner of my eye when I am watching TV I have to switch channels. 'I also gasp or sigh if I see a yellow taxi when I am out. I'm terrified of them, and if I saw a yellow taxi on the street I would feel this urge just to drive into it.' She added: 'Obviously I didn't but it felt like there was something in my brain that needed to be released. 'It's very difficult but I try to have yellow flowers in my house to try and cure this fear.' She added: 'It has had an absolutely massive impact on my life. 'The whole incident was incredibly traumatic and I am still coming to terms with it. I cannot face returning to the accident site. The mother-of-two was hit by one of Derby's distinctive yellow Hackney Carriages (pictured) in the city centre . The 51-year-old had to leave her job as a Barclays bank clerk as a result of the injuries she suffered . 'You never expect something like this to happen to you.' She was struck by one of Derby's distinctive yellow Hackney Carriages in the city centre as she crossed a road ten months ago. She was hit as the cab reversed at speed - before the driver left the scene without helping her. He initially denied any involvement in the incident, but was charged with driving without due care and attention, eventually pleading guilty to the offence on the day of his trial. He was fined \u00a3400 pounds and given seven penalty points. Speaking about the accident, Ms Cobourn said: 'I looked up and the next thing I knew I was on the road. I couldn't feel anything from my waist down, I thought I had broken both my legs. The pain was like nothing I have ever felt before - it was absolutely agonising.' Chromophobia, also known as chromatophobia or chrematophobia, is a persistent, irrational fear of colours. More severe cases of this phobia can hinder daily activities for some people. People with the phobia may associate a distressing event with a specific colour. The phobia can develop following a trauamatic event involved either one or more colours, while some people become sensitive only to particular shades. Fears of specific colour is called erythrophobia for the fear of red and leukophobia for the fear of white. Although actually clinical phobias to colours are rare, colours can elicit psychological reactions or hormonal responses. Symptoms can vary and may include anxiety, including palpitations, chest discomfort, shortness of breath and tremors. Effective treatment for this phobia involves methods that include systematic desensitization and therapy. She initially had pins put in her hip at the Royal Derby Hospital but later needed a second operation - and a complete replacement. She now has to rely on son Jack, 16, to help around the house. She has received two interim payments to help pay her mortgage and bills while injury lawyers deal with her claim for compensation. The taxi driver's insurers have already admitted liability. Ms Cobourn added: 'One of the most difficult aspects to deal with was the fact the driver did not try to help me and also denied the incident. 'I had to brace myself for a criminal trial only for the guilty plea to come at the last minute - when paired with my health problems, it was incredibly hard to cope with. 'The financial support my lawyers have secured has been a huge help and really eased my financial worries while I have been unable to work. 'I'm now looking to the future and hope that gaining justice regarding the crash will help me to move forward with my life.' Ian Whittaker, an associate solicitor at legal firm Irwin Mitchell, which is representing Ms Cobourn, said: 'This case is a terrible example of the life-changing consequences that road traffic collisions can have on those involved. 'Not only did Mrs Cobourn need major hip surgery and require adaptations to her home, but she has suffered financial worries due to being unable to work and continues to receive counselling support as she works to come to terms with the psychological effects of the incident. 'We are delighted to have helped her secure interim payments that provide reassurance and financial support at this incredibly difficult time, and also hope to work quickly to help her secure justice regarding her case following the admission of liability from the driver's insurer.'\n"]}

The granddaughter of former Manchester United manager Tommy Docherty has admitted falsely claiming almost \u00a318,000 in benefits. Amy Wilkinson, 28, claimed\u00a0housing benefit and council tax benefit even though she was living in a home owned by her mother and her partner, who was also working. Wilkinson, who was a British Airways cabin crew attendant, was ordered to pay back a total of \u00a317,604 that she claimed over two years when she appeared at South and East Cheshire Magistrates Court last week. She admitted two charges of dishonestly making false representations in order to claim housing benefit, Council Tax benefit and income support. Magistrates sentenced her to 24 weeks' imprisonment suspended for 24 months and ordered her to pay costs of \u00a3675 and a victim surcharge of \u00a350. Her grandfather, Tommy Docherty, now 86, was manager of Manchester United from 1972 until 1977. He was sacked over his affair with the wife of the team's physio in 1977. Steph Cordon, Cheshire East Council's head of communities, said: 'It is a big mistake for fraudsters to think they can get away with claiming benefits they are not entitled to. 'They risk ending up with a criminal conviction for a serious offence of dishonesty and being ordered to repay the money they have falsely claimed. 'We have a zero-tolerance policy towards benefit fraud because we are determined to ensure that the benefits system works for people who really need help.'

Fundraising: A pregnant Amy Wilkinson outside Downing Street in 2011 after she raised \u00a310,000 for charity after the death of her son . However, investigators from Cheshire East Council's benefit fraud investigation team and the Department for Work and Pensions found she had failed to declare that her mother owned the property for which she was claiming housing benefit. They also discovered that Wilkinson's partner had joined her household in January 2012 and had been supporting her and the family financially. Over a two-year period, she received a total of \u00a317,604 in state benefits that she was not entitled to. She will have to repay in full the benefits that she fraudulently obtained. In 2011 she raised more than \u00a310,000 for baby charity Tommy's and was thanked by the Chancellor George Osborne, who is also her local MP. She spent 18 months fundraising after she went into labour at 29 weeks and lost her son, Billy John, who tragically only lived for three minutes. Describing why she raised the money she said at the time: 'I was 29 weeks pregnant when I went into labour but they don't know why, there's just no answer for it. I needed something to focus on. 'Tommy's has been fabulous with us and on their website, they have a forum where you can talk to other people about it. I never realised how many people have been through what we have been through because at times I thought I was the only one.'\n"]}

With just weeks until his box-office victory lap for \"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\" Joss Whedon is now facing a lawsuit accusing him of stealing the idea for the 2012 meta-horror movie The Cabin in the Woods. Whedon produced and co-wrote the script for Cabin with director Drew Goddard, a writer on Whedon's \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\" and a fanboy favorite in his own right, with credits that include Netflix's \"Daredevil\" (and reportedly may soon include Sony's upcoming Spider-Man projects). Whedon and Goddard are named as defendants, along with Lionsgate and Whedon's Mutant Enemy production company, in the complaint filed Monday in California federal court. Joss Whedon Slams 'Jurassic World' Clip as \"'70s-Era Sexist\" In the complaint, Peter Gallagher (no, not that Peter Gallagher) claims Whedon and Goddard took the idea for \"The Cabin in the Woods\" from his 2006 novel \"The Little White Trip: A Night In the Pines.\" He's suing for copyright infringement and wants $10 million in damages. Gallagher is basing his claim on the works' similar premises: Both feature a group of young people terrorized by monsters while staying at a cabin in what is revealed to be (spoiler alert) a horror-film scenario designed by mysterious operators. Read the full complaint. Gallagher also alleges similarities between the characters' names and personalities -- his book's blond Julie and shy Dura and the film's Jules (Anna Hutchison) and Dana (Kristen Connolly), and handsome and scatterbrained men in both works -- and certain scenes involving the characters finding strange items in their respective cabins and discovering hidden cameras. 'Age of Ultron': Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch Are \"Massively Important,\" Says Joss Whedon (Video) In the complaint, Gallagher describes how he self-published the novel and \"began grassroots efforts\" to sell it on the Venice Beach boardwalk and on Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade. \"[The defendants] currently reside and operate out of Santa Monica, California, a short distance from where the Book was sold,\" the lawsuit claims. Gallagher alleges that he \"was contacted by multiple credited entertainment industry producers who expressed interest in the Book,\" but he doesn't specify Lionsgate or Mutant Enemy. A Lionsgate spokesman declined to comment. The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to representatives for Whedon and Goddard. \u00a92015 The Hollywood Reporter. All rights reserved.\n"]}

Taken in the capital Tehran, the photographs show teenagers and people in their early 20s kissing in public, drinking alcohol and living openly gay lifestyles.

Peace and love: Young people in Iran are defying the country's hardline Islamic image to create a more Westernised society . Young people represent the largest societal bloc in Iran, with over 63 per cent of Iran's population of 73 million people aged under 30. The Iranian youth is also among the most politically active groups within the 57 nations that make up the Islamic world. As the most restive segment of Iranian society, the young also represent one of the greatest long-term threats to the current form of theocratic rule. Young activists have influenced the Islamic Republic's political agenda since 1997. After the 2009 presidential election, the Iranian youth was the biggest bloc involved in the region's first sustained 'people power' movement for democratic change, which helped create a new political dynamic in the Middle East. In many ways the highly-politicised largely Shiite youth of Iran can be seen as a forerunner of the Arab Spring movement that swept the Sunni Muslim world in 2011.

Making a change: The Iranian youth is among the most politically active groups within the 57 nations that make up the Islamic world . Unconventional: A young parkour performer runs, jumps and climbs on metal railings outside a mosque in the Iranian capital Tehran . The Islamic Republic of Iran forcibly regained control over the most rebellious sector of society through detentions, expulsions from universities, and expanding the powers of its own young paramilitary forces following the rise of the 'people power' movement in 2009. But youth demands have not changed, and anger simmers beneath the surface. The regime also remains vulnerable because it has failed to address basic socio-economic problems among the young. The will of young people in Iran has also influenced Iran's changing relationship with the U.S, which has just come to preliminary nuclear agreement with the Islamic Republic. The biggest enforcement provision in that agreement is turning into one of the mostly hotly contested elements, however. And the debate barely involves Iran. Instead, it concerns the Obama administration's promise to quickly re-impose sanctions on Iran if the country cheats on any part of the agreement to limit its nuclear program to peaceful pursuits. This would be relatively straightforward for the sanctions imposed by the U.S., as Congress is eager to keep the pressure on. But it is far from clear whether President Barack Obama can guarantee such action at the United Nations, which has imposed wide-ranging penalties that all U.N. members must enforce . As the most restive segment of Iranian society, the young also represent one of the greatest long-term threats to Iran's theocratic rule . Hip hop and break dance performers pose for the camera as the dance in the streets of the modern Ekbatan neighbourhood of Tehran .

Love and religion: A gay couple kiss one another while holding a copy of the Koran as a symbol of the struggle for change in Iran . A young Iranian is seen driving in to the country's desert to join one of the many illegal, alcohol-fuelled parties hosted there . At present, there's no firm agreement on how or when to lift the sanctions in the first place. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, and President Hassan Rouhani yesterday said they want all sanctions lifted on the first day of implementation. That's not the position of U.S. and other negotiators, a major issue that still must be worked out. Assuming it can be, that still would leave the big question of possible re-imposition. The disagreement on this issue is between the U.S. and its European allies on one side, and Russia and China on the other - all countries involved in the nuclear negotiations. And even though all six world powers and Iran agreed last week to the framework agreement that is supposed to be finalized by June 30, the 'snapback' mechanism for U.N. sanctions remains poorly defined and may prove unworkable. 'If Iran violates the deal, sanctions can be snapped back into place,' Obama declared last week. Controversial: A young Iranian woman stands in front of an old piece of political graffiti reading 'Down with USA' A young man is seen taking part in parkour, where contestants have to find unorthodox ways of moving around the city . Bouncing around the city: A young man is seen taking part in parkour in the capital of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Tehran .

Superman: A young parkour performer runs, jumps and climbs over a concrete bench outside a mosque in the Iranian capital Tehran . Defying the regime: It is illegal for people to kiss in public in Iran - something man young people choose to ignore . Obama went further this week, saying that restoring the international sanctions would not require consensus among U.N. Security Council members.\u00a0And Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz, who helped seal last week's pact, insisted 'no one country could block the snapback.' That assertion rests on an informal compromise reached at the talks in Lausanne, Switzerland, to bypass the typical U.N. Security Council process if Iran breaks the agreement. Normally in that body, any one of the five permanent members - the U.S., Britain, France, Russia and China, which are all party to the Iran negotiations - can veto resolutions. But many questions remain, including what would happen if two or more countries object. Russia and China have traditionally opposed almost all U.N. sanctions measures, and, perhaps tellingly, neither country's foreign minister was present when the April 2 framework was unveiled. Washington and its negotiating partners plan to suspend or lift many sanctions after the U.N. nuclear agency confirms Iran has scaled back its activity in accordance with a final deal. But the U.S. and its European partners want the capacity to quickly reinstate the restrictions if Iran reneges.\n"]}

The Merfin, a  monofin made from recycled rubber that lets you experience what it might be like to swim like a mermaid, looks set to be the essential piece of beach play kit this summer. The product is the brainchild of Australian professional freediver Kazzie Mahina. The 37-year-old, from Byron Bay in New South Wales, created the flippers in the shape of a mermaid tail to allow kids and adults alike to streak through the ocean like an underwater creature. Scroll down for video . Wouldn't you like to be a mermaid? The Merfin, a rubber monofin that mimics the experience of swimming like a mermaid has arrived on UK shores. The product retails at \u00a399 in the UK . The novelty swimming product has taken off around the world and can be used by kids and grown-ups alike. Designer Kazzie Mahina says the Merfin can also help to tone abs and thighs . After taking off Down Under, the Merfin is now available to buy in the UK, with the country's sole stockist, online retailer Gigi Brooks, reporting brisk trade. Ali Lovegrove from the Lincolnshire-based stockist  told FEMAIL that the Merfin has been 'very popular' in recent months with a rush expected as beach-goers prepare for their summer breaks. 'As the weather has been warming up in recent weeks we have seen an influx in sales from surfing hotspots in the UK including Cornwall, Devon and Wales and, as we ship worldwide, we have sent them as far as Japan.' She added that the company had been attracted to the Merfin because 'there is absolutely nothing like them in the market'. Diver Mahina, who can hold her breath for a startling five minutes, says she spent years perfecting the product. She said: 'I started designing the fins in the middle of 2006. I went through lots of samples, prototypes, lots of trial and error.' Mermaid entrepreneur: After spending years bringing the product to the market, Mahina has found herself in demand, with Urban Outfitters chasing an adult version of the product to sell in the US . In character: The freediver and part-time mermaid, who can hold her breath for five minutes, is due to launch a new product this summer . 'People now would go \"oh, that seems to obvious\" or \"it looks so simple\" but it wasn't back then.' In 2011, she launched a website and started selling the Merfins out of Australia, and by the next year they were in stores around the country. The diver says that after a successful launch in Australia, she was then  'hunted down' by US retailer Urban Outfitters, who chased the brand for an adult range of the fins. 'They hunted me, they wouldn't leave me alone. I was like \"What is going on? This is one of the coolest stores in America.\"' The fins come in four sizes, ranging from child's to adult's, ensuring that grown-ups can flip and swoosh in the water alongside their little ones. Colours range from coral to aqua to a striking sunset orange. Prices start at \u00a399 for a child's fin and \u00a3120 for adult's. Gigi Brooks is currently the only UK stockist and has the fins in Coral and Aqua. The retailer said the product has been 'very popular' There's an easy-release ankle clip too to ensure that should you prefer to have your feet separated, you quickly can. Designed to be used in the pool or the sea, the Merfin is also being promoted as a fitness aid which can help to tone abdominal and thigh muscles. Mahina said she is already working on her next product, set to be released in time for next summer, and can't believe how lucky she is to have found something she is so passionate about. 'Sometimes I pinch myself and say how did it work out that I am the luckiest girl in the world. 'Dreams and ideas belong to the world they don't belong to any one person and anybody could tap into them and I think I just happened to be connected and passionate and listening enough. 'The mermaiding is lots of fun, and the gift of being able to give that gift of fun [means ] my fun is just multiplying to  know that other people are enjoying themselves.'\n"]}
{"question_id": 500, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Freddie Gray did not get timely medical care after he was arrested and was not buckled into a seat belt while being transported in a police van, Baltimore police said Friday. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts told reporters there are no excuses for the fact that Gray was not buckled in as he was transported to a police station. Five days after Gray's death and amid ongoing protests, police officials acknowledged mistakes were made during and after his arrest. Gray, who was stopped April 12 after a foot pursuit through several housing complexes, should have received medical attention at the scene of his arrest, said Deputy Police Commissioner Kevin Davis. A witness said the man was yelling and indicated he was having difficulty breathing. Batts told reporters in an afternoon news conference: \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" Investigators are trying to learn more about Gray's condition at each of the three stops the van made on its way to a police station. At the first stop, Gray was placed in leg irons. The driver stopped a second time \"to deal with Mr. Gray and the facts of that interaction are under investigation,\" Davis said. The van stopped one more time to add a second prisoner. Batts told reporters that at the third stop an officer saw Gray on the floor of the van, asking for a medic. The officer and the van driver picked him up and put him on the seat, the commissioner said. When the van arrived at the Western District station, police called for an ambulance, said Davis, who is in charge of the investigation. An attorney for the Gray family said it was positive news, but there is a more important issue. \"It's certainly a step towards acknowledging the truth that the police did not follow their own internal regulations,\" Jason Downs told CNN's \"Erin Burnett OutFront.\" \"What it does not get at is, it does not get at the core of this case and that is why did Mr. Gray need medical attention in the first place? ...  That's the question that still has not been answered.\" The developments came two days after a police union attorney spoke of the possibility that the injuries occurred during a \"rough ride,\" a frequently claimed practice in which police vehicles are deliberately driven in a way that injures suspects. At least two suspects have won court cases against the city after being left paralyzed in such rides over the last decade or so, The Baltimore Sun reported Thursday. Gray died Sunday, one week after Baltimore police arrested him. At some point, he suffered a severe spinal cord injury. His family said his voice box was crushed and his neck snapped before he slipped into a coma and died. Batts said he had been given preliminary results of an autopsy on Gray. The medical examiner's full autopsy may take another 30 to 45 days, Batts said, because toxicology tests still need to be examined and spinal experts may be brought in to assess Gray's injury. Meanwhile, anger over the incident and the police response to it continued to grow ahead of a major rally that organizers vowed would \"shut this city down on Saturday.\" \"The people are demanding immediate arrests, immediate end to the protracted investigation, and immediate end to the stonewalling,\" said Malik Shabazz, president of Black Lawyers for Justice. But he and other officials vowed the protests would be peaceful -- much as they were Thursday night, despite a few scuffles and two detentions. \"No one has come to try and burn Baltimore down,\" another protest organizer, the Rev. Tim Sutton, told reporters. Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake thanked those protesters who have demonstrated peacefully. \"Our community is very clear. They demand answers and so do I,\" she said. The mayor said that will take some time, but she had concerns about what happened to Gray. \"I still want to know why the policies and procedures for transport were not followed,\" Rawlings-Blake said. \"I realize there is frustration over this investigation, but I want to be clear: there is a process, but we have to respect that process.\" Batts addressed calls for his resignation after Gray's death by saying he would not step down. Police first encountered Gray as they patrolled an area known for crime and drug activity. When Gray saw them, authorities said, he started running. Gray was arrested after police found what they said was a switchblade on him. An attorney for Gray's family has said the knife was a pocket knife of legal size. One video of Gray's arrest shows officers dragging him to a police van, his legs dangling limply behind him. \"His leg look broke!\" a bystander yells as a witness captures the arrest on a cell phone video. That witness, who only wants to be identified as Kiona, said she knew Gray as a joker and a ladies' man. But that day, he said only one thing to her. \"When I ran up the street and seen him, the first thing I asked him was he OK because I heard him screaming,\" Kiona said. \"He didn't never say yes or no, he just said, 'I can't breathe,' and just was yelling.\" Gray's family attorneys and protesters said police didn't have any probable cause to chase him but did so only because he was \"running while black.\" Police union attorney Michael Davey said officers had every right to give chase. \"There is a Supreme Court case that states that if you are in a high-crime area, and you flee from the police unprovoked, the police have the legal ability to pursue you, and that's what they did,\" he said. \"In this type of an incident, you do not need probable cause to arrest. You just need a reasonable suspicion to make the stop.\" Andrew O'Connell, an attorney for the Gray family, said \"police have a lot of questions that need to be answered.\" \"What was the reasonable suspicion? Why were they arresting our client?\" he said. \"He had no weapon in his hand. He was committing no crime, and he wasn't hurting anybody. The police had no reasonable suspicion to stop or arrest him,\" the attorney said. The Gray family has not yet seen the preliminary autopsy report, attorney William Murphy said. Downs said the family has commissioned an independent autopsy. While police say five of the six officers involved in the arrest have provided statements to investigators, the department has not released details of what the officers said or how Gray might have suffered the fatal injury. The sixth officer has invoked his right to refuse to answer questions, Batts said. Baltimore protests: 5 questions demonstrators are asking . The Justice Department is investigating whether Gray's civil rights were violated during the arrest. Rawlings-Blake said earlier she \"absolutely\" believes an outside investigation is needed, especially given the history of police misconduct. A wake will be held Sunday for Gray, with a memorial service and funeral following on Monday. CNN's Holly Yan, Carolyn Sung, Ashley Fantz, Kimberly Hutcherson, Eliott C. McLaughlin, Catherine E. Shoichet, Kevin Conlon and Dana Ford contributed to this report.\n"]}

Rumors about the state of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's marriage ratcheted up a notch on Monday in the U.S, with fresh claims in the media that the couple spend more time apart than together. But it's clear the celebrity couple are anxious to put the rumors to rest. Amber, who turns \u00a029 on Wednesday, is obviously planning to celebrate with her husband.

{"question_id": 502, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Alan Pardew will target a marquee signing this summer so his Crystal Palace side are taken seriously next season. Pardew has transformed Palace into relegation candidates to a club pushing for a top-half finish since taking charge in January. He will be active in the transfer market come the end of the season in an attempt to take the club to the next level and is keen to bring in a big name to declare the club\u2019s intentions. Crystal Palace manager Alan Pardew is keen on bringing in a star name to boost the club's profile . Eagles boss Pardew slapped a '40 to 60 million pounds' price-tag on Crystal Palace winger Yannick Bolasie . \u2018That is a solution to not just give us a better media standing than we have, but to also give everybody else here the recognition in terms of their value that we could attract a player of that type,\u2019 Pardew said. \u2018That is something I have thought about.\u2019 Pardew is prepared to let star winger Yannick Bolasie leave for \u2018between 40 and 60 million pounds\u2019 and would use the money to build a formidable squad. But even if that does not happen, Pardew, whose side host relegation strugglers Hull City on Saturday, is adamant that he will be backed by chairman Steve Parish. The former Newcastle boss was able to make five permanent signings in January and will look to add several more when the transfer window re-opens. Pardew added: \u2019To be honest, the chairman is as much banging on my door as I am his. The most important thing is we get good value.\u2019 While Palace may seek to break the \u00a37million club transfer record set with the September 2014 arrival of James McArthur from Wigan, Pardew is loath to do so lightly. Palace broke their club transfer record in September 2014 when they splashed out \u00a37m on James McArthur . 'It isn't just about the money and isn't just about the figure that you pay,' said Pardew. 'It really is about are they better than what you have. 'Therefore what is their value? And that is what you have to gauge. 'I have to say this club has done very well in the transfer market prior to me coming in. I think in that window just passed we bought really well, but really we haven't seen them. 'I haven't had to lean on Shola Ameobi, Jordon Mutch, Chungy (Lee Chung-yong) too much really. 'And I really did think, particularly in Shola, that he was going to be a massive player for us if it got close. 'In a way the team have taken that equation away.' Pardew has guided Palace out of the relegation mire since his January arrival, with the Eagles fifth in the Premier League standings on 2015's fixtures alone. Victory over Hull in Saturday's Selhurst Park clash would rubber-stamp Palace's top-flight safety, and Pardew admitted he is eager to make what experiments he can with next term in mind. 'There could be an opportunity to look for next year and that is what I am going to do between now and the end of the year,' he said. 'I will try and keep our professionalism together, but also look at Chungy and Jordon Mutch and how they are going to impact on what is a good team at the moment.

But in a development that could have come straight out of the sitcom, it has been revealed that the Corporation is paying tens of thousands of pounds of taxpayers' money to book meetings in nearby buildings because the headquarters lacks space. New Broadcasting House in Central London covers half a million square feet, took a decade to build and was opened by the Queen in 2013 \u2013 four years behind schedule and at least \u00a355 million over budget. Scroll down for video . The BBC has admitted it 'occasionally' runs out of meeting rooms in its \u00a31billion New Broadcasting House . The huge steel-and-glass building has specially designed 'huddle zones' and a 'meeting tower' on stilts in the atrium. One of the running jokes in W1A is that its fictional meeting rooms are named after popular entertainers \u2013 Hugh Bonneville's character Ian Fletcher, the BBC's 'Head of Values', frequently meets colleagues 'inside Frankie Howerd'. Now, in response to a freedom of information request, the BBC has admitted it 'occasionally' runs out of meeting rooms and spent \u00a347,198 on booking external spaces nearby during the last financial year. Corporation insiders say these venues include De Vere's West One business centre and the luxury Langham Hotel \u2013 both just across the street from New Broadcasting House \u2013 and that meetings have included 'leadership breakfasts'. The huge building has specially designed 'huddle zones' and a 'meeting tower' on stilts in the atrium . One source said: 'The leadership breakfasts at De Vere are renowned for the lavish catering. The BBC is cutting jobs but can still afford to cater for breakfast meetings for senior managers.' Another said: 'It's bonkers to hold meetings across the street.' The BBC has been criticised by spending watchdog the National Audit Office (NAO) over the running costs of New Broadcasting House, which are almost double that of comparable buildings in Central London. A BBC spokesman said: 'It is occasionally necessary to book nearby venues, especially for larger meetings. Value for money is always taken into account.' But Jonathan Isaby, chief executive of the TaxPayers' Alliance, said licence fee-payers would be furious over spiralling costs.

But 17-year-old Siobhan O'Dell hit back after being sent a rejection letter from Duke University, by sending the admissions office a message of her own, rejecting their rejection. The teenager, from North Carolina, had applied to the prestigious college in her home state, but on March 26 she was sent a letter telling her she had failed to make the grade. Scroll down for video . Siobahn O'Dell, 17, from North Carolina, sent this response to an email from the admissions department at Duke University telling her she had missed out on a place . However, refusing to take no for an answer, she wrote back, saying: 'After careful consideration, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept your refusal to offer me admission into the Fall 2015 freshman class at Duke. Mirroring the standard format of college rejection letters, she added: 'Despite Duke's outstanding success in rejecting previous applicants, you simply did not meet my qualifications. 'Therefore, I will be attending Duke University's 2015 freshmen class. I look forward to seeing you then.' Speaking to MailOnline about the letter, she said: 'They sent me a typical college rejection letter, \"This year we had an outstanding pool of applicants...\", blah, blah, blah. 'It made me realize how much power universities have over students. Seniors labor over applications, stress over waiting, and sometimes cry over the answer. Then that's it. 'The college has all the power. But what if that wasn't it? What if we got to treat the college like they treated us? I wanted to give them a taste of their own medicine.'

But a study has found that the opposite may be true. A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed that the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick, and invested in employment schemes, the more likely its residents were to want a job. A Europe-wide survey of 19,000 people revealed the more a country paid to the unemployed or sick the more likely its residents were to want a job.\u00a0In Norway, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80% of people wanted a job. In Estonia, one of least generous, only around 40% did . In Norway in particular, which pays the highest benefits in Europe, almost 80 per cent of people wanted a job, . By contrast in Estonia, one of the least generous countries, only around 40 per cent did. The survey was carried out by sociologists Dr Kjetil van der Wel and Dr Knut Halvorsen from Oslo and Akershus University College. They examined responses to the statement: 'I would enjoy having a paid job even if I did not need the money' put to the interviewees for the European Social Survey in 2010. People who are hungry are more inclined to support of the welfare state policies that help the poor. The extraordinary results of a recent study from Aarhus University found that the state of our bodies has a significant influence on our position on specific political issues. Researchers said people's support for apparently altruistic policies of wealth redistribution is not so much a reflection of concern for the poor but 'rather a strategy for securing further resources for themselves.' And they their findings could revolutionise perceptions of how people come to adopt a political stance, with our ideological views apparently swayed by basic biology. These responses were then compared with the amount the countries spent on welfare benefits and employment schemes, while taking into account the population differences between the member states. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits, which was reflected in the percentage of people agreeing with the statement at almost 60 per cent. The researchers also found that governments that intervene  to help the unemployed find work made people in general more likely to agree that they wanted work even if they didn't need the money. 'Many scholars and commentators fear that generous social benefits threaten the sustainability of the welfare state due to work norm erosion, disincentives to work and dependency cultures,' the researchers said in the paper, 'The bigger the worse? A comparative study of the welfare state and employment commitment'. 'A basic assumption is that if individuals can obtain sufficient levels of well-being - economic, social and psychological - from living off public benefits, compared to being employed, they would prefer the former. The UK was average for the generosity of benefits and this was reflected in the percentage of people wanting to work - at 60% (stock image pictured). The study also found that governments that intervene to help the unemployed find work made people more likely to say they wanted work even if they didn't need the money . 'When a 'critical mass' of individuals receive public benefits rather than engaging in paid work, the norms regulating work and benefit behaviour will weaken, setting off a self-reinforcing process towards the 'self-destruction' of the welfare state. They also said that this may be because people who receive generous benefits when out of work may feel more inclined to give something back to the state by striving hard to find work. 'The notion that big welfare states are associated with widespread cultures of dependency, or other adverse consequences of poor short term incentives to work, receives little support.' The paper was published in the journal Work, Employment and Society.\n"]}

Abedin had last surfaced on Monday at an Ohio Chipotle restaurant when she and Clinton popped in, both wearing sunglasses, for lunch. On Tuesday she was photographed leaving a Norwalk, Iowa fruit processing company and walking toward 'Scooby,' the now-famous customized black van that Secret Service agents have driven more than 1,000 miles since Sunday. HUMA, SANS BURRITO: Abedin left Capital City Fruit in Norwalk, Iowa on Wednesday ahead of Hillary Clinton, and headed toward the campaign van that aides have nicknamed 'Scooby' STYLISH: Human sported a Louis Vuitton bag and walked alongside an unidentified campaign staffer . ALL DONE! Clinton had just finished a limited-access 'roundtable' discussion on small business issues . Abedin has known Clinton since 1996, when she scored a White House internship working for the then-first lady. In 2008 Clinton tapped her to be her 'body woman' when she ran for president the first time. She shadowed Hillary everywhere and anticipated her every need \u2013 from food orders and dry cleaning to lint rollers and cosmetic touch-ups. When Clinton became secretary of state a year later, Abedin became her deputy chief of staff. It was there that she became linked to most recent in a series of scandals that Clinton will carry as heavy baggage whiel she runs for the White House. Daily Mail Online confirmed in March that Abedin had a personal email address on Clinton's home-brew server, the same piece of hardware that stored Clinton's communications from her tenure at State until she deleted more than 32,000 of the records. Abedin (left), shown with then-Secretary of State Clinton during a 2010 diplomatic meeting in Vietnam, was her deputy chief of staff . Spotted: Hillary and Huma order at Chipotle in Maumee, Ohio, at lunchtime on Tuesday \u2013 the first time they had been seen all day. But nobody in the restaurant recognized them during their 45-minute meal . Abedin keeps a low profile, a choice that a Democratic Party insider said is the product of two problems. 'First, you never want to be more famous than your boss,' the source explained on Wednesday. 'And then there's the Weiner problem.' Abedin is married to disgraced former New York Democratic Congressman Anthony Weiner, whose spectacular fall from grace came after he was exposed for sending lurid Twitter messages to women \u2013 including one of his barely covered genitalia. She stood by him through the embarrassment and through his resignation from Congress. Weiner ran for Mayor of New York City last year, only to see his stock tumble with a second round of sexting allegations, this time confirmed by the woman he was exchanging racy messages with. 'Scooby' is a customized and armored Chevy van that Clinton and her top staffers occupied during a 1,000-mile trip from New York to Iowa this week . EMAIL-GATE: Abedin had an email address on the former secretary of state's private server, judging from records maintained by Lexis-Nexis . Abedin and Weiner have a 2-year-old child together. After she returned from maternity leave in June 2012, the State Department made a special accommodation for her that is now the subject of an inspector general accommodation. Abedin was permitted to shift her employment classification from 'employee' to 'Special Government Employee,' a perk that allowed her to have a second income while drawing a government salary. That moonlight gig was at Teneo Holdings, a corporate consulting firm founded by Doug Band, a longtime Bill Clinton confidant. The State Department paid Abedin $135,000 per year to work part-time from her New York City home. Teneo paid her an additional $355,000 via an annual contract. The whopping combined income helped her household stay financially afloat in the wake of Weiner's resignation, and his loss of a congressional salary.\n"]}

Brent Council said it was no longer able to afford to pay for a live-in carer to look after Second World War veteran Robert Clark at his home in Burnt Oak, North London. This is despite the fact he had already used \u00a350,000 of his life savings paying for his care.

A donations page set up by the forces charity Help for Heroes has already raised \u00a310,000 to help Mr Clark remain in his own home . The council told Mr Clark he would have to be moved into a local care home with his son Mike describing the move as like asking his father to go back into a 'prisoner of war camp'. The pensioner's plight prompted armed forces charity Help for Heroes to launch a fund-raising campaign to allow Mr Clark to stay in his home, which he has lived in for more than 50 years and pay towards the cost of a carer. And in just four days the total amount of donations has reached \u00a310,000, despite setting an initial target of \u00a35,000 just four days ago. The amount will pay for around four to five months care for Mr Clark in his own home. David Fraser from the charity confirmed that they are working with Mr Clark to discuss what to do with the cash and added they have set a new fund-raising target of \u00a315,000. He told MailOnline: 'I think when you look at what he has done and what he has been through, he deserves an awful lot of respect. 'He deserves to be able to stay in his own home.' Writing home: Veteran Robert Clark, pictured in 1940, when he was serving with Durham Light Infantry . Mr Clark is one of Britain's oldest surviving prisoners of war - and one of the few British soldiers to survive Hitler's 1,000-mile death march. He was a gunner in the Durham Light Infantry when he was captured by the Nazis in the North African city of Tobruk in June 1942. He spent the rest of the war in prison camps in Poland, before being forced to join the 'death match' in 1945. Now a great-great grandfather, he is one of Britain's oldest surviving PoWs and is registered blind, deaf in one ear, is dependent on a wheelchair and has suffered from severe anxiety. For the past two years he has used his savings to pay towards the \u00a3960-a-week cost of a live-in carer, while Brent Council contributed \u00a3350 per week. But as his money runs out, the council is refusing to increase its funding for Mr Clark. An online petition has also been set up calling for the council to increase its funding, which has also gained almost 170,000 signatures. Robert Clark (front row, second left) pictured on June 21, 1943 at prisoner of war camp Campo PG70 in Italy . His son Mike, whose home in Harpenden, Hertfordshire is not suitable for his father, has previously spoken of how he situation is causing the pensioner anxiety and making him unable to sleep. He explained: 'He\u2019s as good as told me that if he has to move, he\u2019ll just give up on life. Whenever he\u2019s been in hospital, pulls the blankets over his head and stops talking. \u2018He hates being anywhere which isn't familiar, going into a care home will be like going back into a prisoner of war camp.\u2019 However, Brent Council have stated they will not increase their funding for a live-in carer but say there is absolutely no question he will be evicted.

The law, brought in by\u00a0Indiana Governor Mike Pence, was supposed to satisfy evangelicals but has sparked boycotts of the state, amid fears that it would allow legalized discrimination against lesbians and gays. Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, was one of the first corporate executives to react to the polarizing bill, calling it 'brutal' and 'unjust' and saying he was finding ways to reduce investments in Indiana. He initially canceled all events and suspended employee travel to the state. Speaking out:\u00a0Marc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce who was one of the first corporate executives to react to Indiana's\u00a0Religious Freedom Restoration Act, is now trying to relocate state employees who are uncomfortable . However on Wednesday he told CNN Money he was now responding to employee complaints that they no longer want to work and live in the state, and is trying to find ways to help them. It is the most aggressive corporate reaction to the controversial legislation yet. 'I just got an email ... from another employee who said, ''look I don't feel comfortable living in this state anymore, you have to move me out,'' and I gave him a $50,000 relocation package and said, ''great, you're clear to go''.' Benioff was sure to point out that he will not be able to shut down the Salesforce sector in Indiana completely. The San Francisco-based tech company, which offers \u2018customer relationship management\u2019 to other companies, has a total 2,000 employees in the state. A number of companies \u2014 including Salesforce, EMC and Cloudera \u2014 have already withdrawn their sponsorships for Indy Big Data, a tech conference scheduled in May. Change: Benioff tweeted Friday in response to\u00a0Indiana lawmakers saying Friday morning they had amended the already-in-effect law, clarifying that no one will 'be able to discriminate against anyone at any time' Benioff's announcement follows one made by\u00a0Apple CEO Tim Cook. On Monday Cook condemned the laws, saying they were 'very dangerous', went against the founding principles of America, and would take the country back to the days of 'Whites Only' signs in shop doorways. He added that, as a Baptist, he supports religious freedom, but said: 'I was never taught, nor do I believe, that religion should be used as an excuse to discriminate.' Cook, 54, who came out as gay in October last year, made the comments in an op-ed for the Washington Post. He wrote: 'In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law. 'On behalf of Apple, I'm standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation. 'These bills under consideration truly will hurt jobs, growth and the economic vibrancy of parts of the country where a 21st-century economy was once welcomed with open arms.' He also addressed legislation in Texas that 'would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.' Taking a stance: Openly-gay Apple CEO Tim Cook criticized new laws that critics say will allow business owners to openly discriminate . Cook said such bills 'rationalize injustice' by 'pretending to defend' religious freedom, which actually eroding the freedoms of others. Cook drew upon his background growing up in the South in the 1960s and 1970s, during and immediately after the Civil Rights movement when blacks were still heavily discriminated against. He says America's 'days of discrimination' must remain 'deep in the past' and said freedom and equality is a value that is at the heart of his company. He added: 'Apple is open. Open to everyone, regardless of where they come from, what they look like, how they worship or who they love.' Indiana's religious freedom act says that the state and local government 'may not substantially burden a person's right to the exercise of religion' unless that burden is 'essential' to furthering a government interest. It will be up to the courts to decide what counts as 'substantial', but the legislation was largely designed to fend off lawsuits against those who refuse to participate in gay marriage ceremonies. For example a florist who refuses to supply flowers for a same sex ceremony. Supporters say that such provisions already exist in 20 other states, and were actually signed into federal law by Bill Clinton in 1993. But opponents, including Cook, claim these laws form part of a wave of discriminatory powers that threaten to reverse years of progress on equality issue . The Indiana bill forbids the state or local government from 'substantially burdening' a person's religious beliefs unless that burden is 'essential' to further a 'compelling' government interest, and is the 'least restrictive' means of achieving that aim. It allows people or organisations to use the legislation as a defense in court against claims of discrimination against them, and if the court rules in their favor, allows reparations, including compensation payouts. It will be up to the courts and judges to decide what constitutes 'substantial', but critics fear that the broad scope of the law and the tough tests that must be passed to override it, mean that it will allow business owners to openly discriminate in how they operate. Cook is far from the only one opposing the new law in Indiana, with musician Miley Cyrus, and actors Ashton Kutcher, James Van Der Beek and George Takei all speaking out against it. The NBA, WNBA, the Indiana Pacers, and Indiana Fever issued a joint statement Saturday reaffirming their commitment to non-discrimination. Hillary Clinton also messaged to her three million Twitter followers saying that 'we shouldn't discriminate against people because of who they love' following the bill's passing on Thursday. Businesses are also lining up to oppose the legislation, threatening to pull investment or even boycott the state altogether in protest. Fighting back: Demonstrators gathered to protest a controversial religious freedom bill recently signed by Indiana Governor Mike Pence during a rally in Indianapolis on Saturday . Website Angie's List also announced plans to cancel a $40 million expansion to its Indianapolis headquarters because of the new law. 'Angie's List is open to all and discriminates against none and we are hugely disappointed in what this bill represents,' the company's CEO Bill Oesterle said in the statement. Thousands gathered outside the Indiana Statehouse on Saturday to rally against the law, waving rainbow coloured flags and chanting slogans such as 'no hate in our state'. Since the law passed, Republican Senator Mike Pence has robustly defended it, saying that it is necessary to help people defend themselves against 'government overreach'. He also ruled out any possibility of repealing the law, which is due to take effect in July, telling This Week with George Stephanopoulos, that 'the law will stick.'

Gayla Neufeld, 52, struggled to deal with her family's unusual legacy of piling weight around the midriff for years. But the happy couple, who live in Manitoba, Canada, are now using Gayla's 96-inch asset to launch her new career - as an international webcam model. Scroll down for video . 30 stone Gayla Neufeld met her truck driver husband Lance on a fat-fetish forum . She said: 'Growing up I used to be ashamed of my belly but now I have a great following of men who really like it. 'There have been men from all over the world. I have had doctors, lawyers and even bodybuilders, lots of bodybuilders, approach me, which really amazed me. 'They tell me it's the perfect belly. They say it's not marred or scarred and that they love the shape of it because it is a single belly. Some larger women they have a double-layer or a two-tier belly but mine is a single. That is really attractive to a lot of men.' The 52-year-old says men love her 'perfect belly' and she gets approached by bodybuilders and doctors . Thirty stone Gayla wasn't always so body-confident and for years she struggled to deal with her family's unusual genetic legacy. 'Women in my family have always gained weight around the belly, especially after having children,' said Gayla, whose favourite foods are homemade cookies and ice-cream. 'My mum was fat and my favourite sister was fat, as were my grandparents, my grandmother and my great-grandmother. Gayla inherited her big belly from her family.\u00a0'My mum was fat and my favourite sister was fat, as were my grandparents, my grandmother and my great-grandmother,' she said . Aged eight, Gayla already weighted 13 stone. She used to get bullied at school and felt ashamed of her weight . 'Growing up, kids at school would point and laugh at me and say \"boom, boom, boom\" with every step I took. I was really ashamed to be fat.' Aged eight, Gayla already weighed a whopping 13st and continued to pile on even more weight in her teens. One doctor even prescribed her amphetamines to curb her sweet tooth, but it failed and made her even more depressed. Her burgeoning curves made her popular with boys at high school, though, and Gayla had many admirers - but she was too embarrassed at the thought of being naked. Despite her body issues she eventually married at 19 and embarked on a mission to battle the bulge. Gayla's curves attracted boys when she was a teenager, and she married at the age of 19 . However, her husband was embarassed by her size as she continued to pile on the pounds, and they divorced . But instead of maintaining any weight loss, she found herself hovering between 21 and 28 stone. Her wavering confidence was further diminished when her husband said he was embarrassed by her weight and they divorced in 1999. It was at rock-bottom that Gayla discovered an online community of obese women calling themselves SSBBWs - meaning 'super-sized big beautiful women'. These curvaceous women - some in excess of 40 stone - were worshipped by legions of men calling themselves 'fat admirers'. An online community for fat women helped Gayla to embrace her size as she was worshiped by 'fat admirers' Curious to know more, Gayla joined a forum called Bulge Chat and soon found herself overwhelmed with lusty fans. She said: 'I realised I was desirable, I was sexy, I was beautiful and I became confident in who I was. 'I had always thought the men who liked BBWs would be geeks in their mum's basement, but I was totally wrong.' Despite having her pick it was rugged truck driver Lance Neufield, 54, who really caught her attention. 'I realised I was desirable, I was sexy, I was beautiful and I became confident in who I was,' said Gayla . After meeting on Bulge Chat they enjoyed two 15-minute conversations and struck up an instant\u00a0rapport. Lance told her he was driving to Texas with work the following week and they agreed to meet at a truck stop and have dinner. Gayla agreed despite vowing never to fall for anyone again - and she found herself swept off her feet by the Canadian. She said: 'When he pulled up and I saw him I was like, 'Oh my God, he is so cute'. 'He got in the car and he said to me, 'Your pictures online do you no justice'. I was like, 'Aww, that's so sweet' and I just blushed. When Lance and Gayla first met, they stayed up all night talking and smooching on the sofa . 'Years later I found out that his computer didn't produce very good pictures, but it's okay, it still made me feel good at the time. 'We had our first dinner and got a bottle of Champagne afterwards and rented the General's Daughter and The Thomas Crown Affair. 'We didn't get through any of those movies because we stayed up all night talking and smooching on the couch like a couple of kids. 'I was sad when he had to go.' They embarked on a long-distance relationship before Gayla agreed to move to Manitoba, Canada, to be with Lance - and they married six years later. Gayla moved from Texas to Canada to be with Lance, and they married six years later . Despite her size, they claim to enjoy an 'active and satisfying sex life', though Gayla's weight causes other day-to-day obstacles. She struggles to shop for clothes that fit around her 96-inch belly and must use a motorised cart if required to walk long distances. Getting into a car is also an ordeal and she must book two seats on an aeroplane when flying. She has a range of health issues including arthritis and thyroid problems, but remains upbeat about the future. Gayla struggles to walk long distances and has to book two seats on an aeroplane when flying . She said: 'As far as the health aspects go, I don't really worry about them. My mother is still alive and she is 82. 'I have had doctors tell me more then once that I needed to lose weight for health reasons but I truly\u00a0believe that when it is your time to go, it is your time to go.' Lance, who has three children from a previous relationship, has always been attracted to Gayla's supersize paunch but wouldn't stand in her way if she attempted to lose weight. Gayla's favourite foods are cookies and ice-cream. She says she doesn't worry about health problems . He said: 'This woman is the love of my life. I would 100% support her if she decided to lose weight. 'The first thing that attracted me to her was that she had the most beautiful face I had ever seen. 'The belly was just the bonus on top of all her other beauty. 'It doesn't matter to me whether it is bigger or smaller because it's not really her belly I love - I love her.' 'The belly was just the bonus on top of all her other beauty,' says Gayla's latest husband, Lance . With Lance's continuing support Gayla is planning to continue her modelling career and win over even more fans. She said: 'I allowed the world to dictate to me what I was supposed to look like and who I was supposed to be. By taking a body-positive image I have empowered myself to be who I am and to enjoy my life. 'I'm not going to tell you that I never have bad days and I am not going to tell you that I don't wish I was thin from time to time, but mostly I just enjoy being me.

And whilst many Australians are enjoying an abundance of sugary treats, many are wondering how much it's going to cost them around the waistline. According to the ABC, the key is to maintain an even balance of 'energy in' and 'energy out.' This means that the energy we put into our bodies through food and drink must be equated with exercise to burn the energy and avoid gaining weight. A small chocolate bunny contains 2212 kjs and would take an hour and ten minutes of swimming to work off . Indulging in two hot cross buns (without jam and butter) will take up to 50 minutes of running to work off . It may be surprising how much physical exercise it takes in order to burn off even the smallest of Easter treats. For four solid mini chocolate Easter eggs it would take 30 to 40 minutes of walking to work off the 550 kilojoules. A female of average weight would need to walk for the full 40 minutes, whereas an 80 kilogram male could burn it off in 30 minutes. One medium chocolate bunny takes two and a half to three hours of kayaking with women needing to paddle for half an hour longer than men to work it off. The key for Easter indulgence is noting our 'energy in' and 'energy out' and balancing food and fitness . Experts are advising that it is better to manage our energy consumption than to try and work it off afterward . Two hot cross buns takes up to 50 minutes running and if you have lathered it with butter and jam, it would take 80 minutes of running. Exercise physiologist Alex Lawrence from Exercise Sport Science Australia has said that many Australians still struggle to maintain a healthy weight as most do not realise how many kilojoules are in the foods we consume. 'It's a lot more efficient to manage your energy consumption, than to try and work off the energy after you've taken it in,' he said. Lawrence is not proposing that we all go and heavily exercise after consuming a small treat. He advises that it is better to make exercise and healthy eating part of your lifestyle so that you can indulge in treats every now and then. 'What we're trying to encourage people to do is make better lifestyle choices; to eat treat foods in moderation and to make sure they are physically active most of the time. That way when holidays, like Easter, come around they don't have to feel like they have to deny themselves,' he said.\n"]}

The Frenchman has thrived in the centre of Arsenal's midfield since returning from loan at Championship side Charlton earlier in the season to\u00a0earn plaudits for his robust performances. Vieira was captain during Arsenal's trophy laden beginning to Arsene Wenger's reign and Coquelin hopes he can keep performing to emulate the club legend. Arsenal midfielder Francis Coquelin, who has become an integral part of their midfield, celebrates with fans . 'I\u2019m not going to say to you I am (the new Vieira), obviously I want to be but I think it\u2019s down to the performance I put in every week so I\u2019m just trying to give me best every game so hopefully I can do that in the long term,' Coquelin told BT Sport. On loan at Charlton, the 23-year-old feared he may not play for the Gunners again. 'Well, obviously that was in my head and I think at the time my loan had finished the first month. I could see the injuries over there, I think Arteta was out, Ramsey and it was the time for me to either extend my loan or come back and I extended it and thought maybe I won\u2019t get the chance now,' added Coquelin. The midfielder is determined to prove himself at Arsenal and hold down his place in the starting XI. The 23-year-old is not shy of putting in a robust challenge on opponents as he adds steel to Arsenal's midfield . 'I always had confidence in myself and belief in myself I just need the chance. I got the chance because other people got injured and tried to grab it with both hands and do as well as I could,' he told BT Sport. Arsenal have been much maligned in recent seasons for lacking grit and strength in the centre of the park, but Coquelin is happy to focus on the defensive side of the game. 'The way I think is that I\u2019m just trying to do what\u2019s best for the team. There are other players who can do this job and I\u2019m trying to focus on mine which is to get the ball back and help the team defensively,' added the 23-year-old. Coquelin, tackling Manchester City's David Silva, has managed to establish a starting place in the Arsenal XI . 'Obviously sometimes you want to get involved a little bit more because we play great football and this is Arsenal, you always want to get involved moving forward. But you need to think about the defensive aspect and that is what my job is all about.' Arsene Wenger's side have been in top form in the Premier League, winning their last six matches to close the gap on Manchester City in second and establish a place in the prestigious top four. The Gunners take on Liverpool at the Emirates on Saturday in a pivotal clash in the race for Champions League football, but Arsenal's 'new Vieira' is confident. 'We obviously want to win this game you know, it\u2019s a massive one, really important and we can increase the gap to nine points if we win so yes, I think it\u2019s really important,' said the Frenchman. 'I can\u2019t say definitely because mathematically it won\u2019t be over, so I can\u2019t say that, but yes we see a lot of confidence in us because over the last few months we have had some big results and if we can beat Liverpool it will be another massive one.'

Dorsey said Blair had always wanted to see his children and tried to develop a relationship, but Blair would not let him. 'I don't hate her,' he said. 'She's the mother of my children.' Blair initially was charged with child abuse, but more charges had been expected after autopsies revealed the siblings were beaten to death. Investigators believe Stephen died in August 2012 and Stoni died the following May. In a court filing, the state said her daughter described a home where she and her surviving brother were beaten with an extension cord and piece of wood and hit and burned with a hot curling iron. Medical exams revealed evidence of abuse, including numerous scars, on the surviving children. Twenty-five scars were found on the boy's back that were consistent with being hit by an extension cord, according to a petition obtained by the Detroit News. Blair's teenage daughter also described how her siblings were killed, according to court papers. 'Blair tortured Stephen for approximately two weeks prior to his death by tying a belt around his neck, throwing hot water on him while in the shower and putting a plastic bag over his head,' the state said, quoting the 17-year-old. Stephen was 'unresponsive' on Aug 30, 2012, and Blair wrapped his body in bed linen and put him in the freezer, the state said.

'I've been informed of the doctor's decision and I fully respect it. Nothing happened between us, it was his decision. Injuries are part and parcel of football, they're not the medical staff's fault.' Muller-Wohlfahrt's decision came after Bayern boss Guardiola appeared to imply that Wednesday's defeat was down to a lack of available players, commenting post-match: . 'We have\u00a0players who were out a long time with injuries. Their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.' Bayern had just 14 fit players to choose from at the Estadio do Drago, with\u00a0Mehdi Benatia, Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben, Javi Martinez and David Alaba among the first-team regulars missing.

Guardiola also appeared to publicly humiliate Muller-Wohlfahrt eight days before his exit from the club, sarcastically clapping him when Benatia left the pitch injured. Continuing at his press conference on Thursday, Guardiola said: 'The responsibility for the defeat in Porto lies with me. Put together, my players have had 30 operations over the last two years, but we've still won the league and cup. 'We can't win every match 3-0 or 4-0 in this situation. It's impossible.'

Robert Bates, from Tulsa, Oklahoma, spoke at length about the deadly incident for the first time on the Today show on Friday, where he was flanked by his lawyer and family members. He also took the opportunity to apologize to the family of the man he killed in the April 2 incident. 'First and foremost let me apologize to the family of Eric Harris,' he said as he became emotional. 'I rate this as number one on my list of things in my life that I regret... I still can't believe it happened.' Scroll down for videos . Apology: Robert Bates became emotional as he apologized to the family of the man he shot dead during a botched sting operation on April 2. The reserve deputy appeared on the Today show on Friday . The interview comes just days after Bates turned himself in to face charges of second-degree manslaughter. He was released after posting a $25,000 bond. On the Today show, he recalled how he had been in his car several blocks away when Harris, 44, ran towards him amid a botched undercover gun-sale operation. Video of the incident shows Bates chasing after the man. In an attempt to subdue him, Bates went to grab his Taser, but was unaware he had actually pulled out his gun instead. In the video, Bates can be heard shouting 'Taser! Taser!' When the gunshot goes off, he says: 'I shot him. I'm sorry.' The fatally-wounded man can be heard daying: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man' before adding: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath!' On the Today show, Bates said he was immediately hit by shock when the gun went off. Mix up: While on the Today show, he showed where he keeps his Taser (left) compared to where he keeps his gun (right). He said that there have previously been cases of officers confusing the position of the two . Support: He appeared on the Today show on Friday flanked by family members and his lawyer, right . 'Oh my god, what has happened?' he recalled thinking. 'This was not an intentional thing. I had no desire to ever take anyone's life.' He said that the shock remains with him and he is unable to sleep or concentrate. Bates also stood up and demonstrated where he keeps his Taser on his body - slightly below his chest - compared to where he keeps his gun - on his lower right-hand side near his pants pocket. Today show host Matt Lauer asked him how he could make the mistake, when the two pieces of equipment are kept so far away from each other on the body. 'This has happened a number of times around the country, I have read about it in the past,' Bates responded. 'I thought to myself after reading several cases, \"I don't understand how this can happen\". You must believe me - it can happen to anyone.' Shot dead: Eric Harris, who is pictured with his son Aidan, was killed in the incident on April 2 . Shooting: This photo shows a deputy bending down to pick up Bates's dropped gun following the accidental shooting in Tulsa earlier this month. Harris is being held down on the ground, out of shot, by other deputies . Terrified: The fatally-wounded man, who is being held by his neck and back by the deputies (pictured), says: 'Oh my god, he shot me! He shot me! He shot me, man.' He then adds: 'Oh, my god. I'm losing my breath' The interview follows reports that Bates, a millionaire insurance broker, had been allowed to 'play cop' after he donated pricey equipment to the department - a claim he called 'unbelievably unfair'. Bates, who is among several well-to-do Tulsa residents who moonlight as reserve deputies, has purchased five vehicles for the police force. He also dismissed recent reports in the Tulsa World that he had not completed the proper hours of training, saying it is 'absolutely the truth' that he had paperwork to show he had completed it. His lawyer added that the report was largely based on claims made by a man who was terminated from the department seven years ago, at which point Bates had only been there a few months. Bates is classified by the Tulsa County Sheriff's Office as an 'advanced reserve'. This means that he went through 480 hours training of the 'Field Training Officer' or FTO. In his statement to investigators, Bates said he had previously attended a five-day homicide school in Dallas and also received 'active shooter response training' with the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in Arizona. He also claims to have been involved in 'at least 100 other' assignments. Charged: Harris (pictured left) died from his injuries and Bates (right in his mug shot) has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. He faces four years in prison if he is convicted . Confusion: An image shows a Taser and a handgun similar to the weapons Bates was carrying. He mistakenly thought he was holding a Taser, not his handgun, when he fatally shot Eric Harris . But the sources who spoke to Tulsa World\u00a0claimed that the reserve deputy was not properly trained to be an armed deputy, despite Sheriff Stanley Glanz saying otherwise. Indeed, Sheriff Glanz and Bates' own legal team have repeatedly produced records which they claim prove he was an 'advanced reserve' and had undergone 480 hours training. However, when asked to produced proof that Bates was certified to use three weapons, including the revolver he fired at Harris, the Sheriff's Office say they have been unable to find the paperwork. Bates faces four years in prison if convicted. See below for video .\n"]}

Commissioner-General Pierre Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl will assess the humanitarian situation in the camp and speak with individuals about ways to relieve the suffering of the people who remain there. \"The visit is prompted by UNRWA's deepening concern for the safety and protection of 18,000 Palestinians and Syrian civilians, including 3,500 children,\" agency spokesman Christopher Gunness told CNN's Paula Newton.  \"Yarmouk  remains under the control of armed groups, and civilian life continues to be threatened by the effects of the conflict.\" Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl will meet with senior Syrian officials, U.N. and relief agency staff members, and displaced people from the camp itself. The Yarmouk refugee camp, which sits just 6 miles from central Damascus, has been engulfed in fighting between the Syrian government and armed groups since December 2012. The London-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says the militant group ISIS and the al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front control about 90% of the camp.  The organization also claims that the Syrian government has dropped barrel bombs on the camp as recently as Sunday in an effort to drive out armed groups. Yarmouk was formed in 1957 to accommodate people displaced by the Arab-Israeli conflict and is the largest Palestinian refugee camp in Syria. The U.N. relief agency estimates that there were 160,000 people in the camp when the conflict began in 2011 between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and opposition fighters. That number has dropped to about 18,000, according to estimates. Yarmouk has been largely cut off from aid since November 2013.  There have been widespread reports of malnutrition and shortages of medical care. \"We will not abandon hope,\" Gunness said.  \"We will not submit to pessimism, because to abandon hope would be to abandon the people of Yarmouk.  ... We cannot abandon the people of Yarmouk, and we will not, hence this mission.\"\n"]}

Australian historian Dr Jim Penman claims Britons today have lost the drive for innovation that epitomised the Victorian era as we enjoy a more comfortable standard of living. He has drawn parallels between modern-day Britain and 100BC in Rome - when the city was at its most powerful as it captured more land overseas and greater wealth poured into the centre. Historian Dr Jim Penman has drawn a parallel between the Roman Empire in 100BC - when Julius Caesar, pictured, was ruler - and Britan today, warning this country is heading for a similar collapse in society . Dr Jim Penman (left) has suggested Britons have lost the biological drive for innovation that helped huge social, economic and industrial changes during the Victorian era, ruled over by Queen Victoria (right) However over subsequent centuries there was a rise in social divisions, inequality and political tensions - which resulted in its demise. Making the comparison Dr Penman said: 'It was a time when democracy was moving towards despotism and in Britain we are now see that politics is becoming much more about individuals rather than political parties. The two-party system has started to break down',The Sunday Telegraph reports. 'We live in a golden age where there have been no major wars in Europe for three quarters of a century. But the economy is stagnating and we're having fewer children. 'And once European countries can no longer defend themselves, the end of national independence cannot be long delayed.' Dr Penman, of the RMIT University in Melbourne, made the claims in his book 'Biohistory: Decline and Fall of the West', and adds that Christianity helped drive social change in Britain which transformed the roles of women and children . Civilisations move in 'cycles' dependent on factors such as food supply, religion and conflict, while epigenetics - a field of study within DNA - explains how people's attitudes and temperament change over time and thus shape society, he argues. 'The First World War had an epigenetic effect in that mothers made anxious by the war gave birth to an unusually aggressive generation which was the main cause of the Second World War', he writes. 'But now we are becoming a lot less warlike and much more reluctant to fight. People no longer want to join the Army, or become engineers. People would rather do arts degrees.'\n"]}

He was also an enthusiastic member of the Theatre Arts Society and Tennis team. He was also voted Most Ambitious and Most Talkative student.

He said: \u2018I remember taking things apart as a kid, radios and other things.

He went on to graduate with his MD from Drexel University\u2019s Hahnemann Medical College in Philadelphia in 1975. Dermatology was not his first love though it would be the speciality on which he settled and which earned him a client list including Madonna, Kelly Ripa, Stephanie Seymour and a constellation of other entertainment big hitters.

As well as seeing his private patients, he hosted a weekly call-in show on Sirius XM radio, ran a company manufacturing his own line of skin creams and serums and appeared regularly on the speaking circuit proselytizing on his speciality at international medical conferences. Over the years Dr Brandt practiced what he preached. He became best known for his Y lifts in which fillers are injected below the cheekbones. And he regularly injected himself with Botox, Restylane, Perlane, Juvedem and Voluma leading to his own startlingly changed appearance - converted into cruel and undeniable parody on \u2018Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u2019 as Dr Franff.

He is actually called Grant, rendering the veil of fiction between the character and Brandt even more gossamer thin. At one point the character is seen drinking from a surgical bag and reinflating his face after being punched. For Dr Brandt, who had always prided himself on being \u2018a kind of pioneer in pushing the limits to see how things work and what the look would be,\u2019 the humor, viewed through the prism of his depression, cut deep.

The cruise ship Carnival Spirit has been damaged and stranded outside Sydney Harbour on Tuesday morning . The cyclonic winds battering Sydney have also caused drama for passengers on board cruise liner the Carnival Spirit which is heading south after being prevented from docking because of the heavy seas . Carnival Spirit was returning from a 12-night cruise to New Caledonia, Vanuatu and Fiji but has been stopped by the huge waves . While the ship was stuck at sea, one passenger told the\u00a0Daily Telegraph\u00a0that 'there was a large wave that hit at 7.30 last night that tore one of the doors off causing a whole lot of water to come flooding through the deck'. 'Even as we speak the ship is creaking and moaning,' passenger Kurt Foster said. 'Last night was absolutely horrendous. In the room all the cupboard doors were flying open and everything on the bench tops was flying off. 'One crew member has been working here for 10 years and he reckons it's the roughest he's seen.'

Enid Hatch, 70, told of the horror as she ran out to the communal hallway of their sheltered housing complex near Cardiff to help what she thought was an injured man, only to discover blood splattered walls where her husband had been brutally beaten\u00a0yards away. The man was in fact Alan Rogers, 73, who had smashed the skull of 76-year-old Fred Hatch. Yesterday Rogers was sentenced to a hospital order under the Mental Health Act and told he may never be released. Fred Hatch, 76, had bought his wife Enid\u00a050 yellow roses - her favourite flowers - to celebrate their golden wedding anniversary, telling her 'each one is for a year of happiness'. He was brutally killed two months later . Grandfather Fred Hatch's injuries were so severe that the surgeon told his wife he had never seen anything so horrific in 20 years of neurosurgery. It is not the first time Mrs Hatch, 70, has lost a loved one in violent circumstances. Her sister Betty Elston\u00a0was murdered on a beach in Sully in 1971 by a stranger who had absconded from a mental health institution. On their golden wedding, Mr Hatch had bought his wife 50 yellow roses - her favourite flowers - telling her 'each one is for a year of happiness'. The pair married six months after meeting in the Royal Navy and were together for five decades. But two months after their anniversary, Mrs Hatch said her life was 'destroyed' when her husband was killed in the horrific attack. Mrs Hatch said the memory of the bloody scene that greeted her as she went to look for her beloved husband at the sheltered accommodation where they lived in Dinas Powys has remained stuck in her head and said 'it will stay with me forever'. She said she had hoped they would go on as 'golden oldies' together. She spoke of the kind, caring and loving man she had known for over half a century, describing him as 'the love of my life'. Alan Rogers, 73, was sentenced  under the Mental Health Act and told he may never be released . Mrs Hatch said: 'Fred didn't deserve to die this way - we had many happy years ahead of us. 'He was the love of my life and my life is destroyed - this man has taken everything.' Heartbroken Mrs Hatch and her four children, who had rushed to their dying father's bedside for one last goodbye, were at Cardiff Crown Court  to hear Rogers plead guilty to manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibilty. Michael Jones, prosecuting, said Rogers had been suffering from paranoid schizophrenia at the time and was 'profoundly mentally ill'. He told the court: 'Mr and Mrs Hatch had lived at the flats since 2012 but on October 8 last year South Wales Police received a telephone call from the defendant telling them 'I've just killed one of my neighbours and hit his head with a hammer'. 'He was in the communal hallway, where Mrs Hatch, concerned she hadn't seen her husband for some time, came out to see Alan Rogers lying on the floor, the phone in his hand. 'It was a man she had seen before and who she described as \"articulate but unkempt\" and her initial thought was that he was injured. 'She ran down asking could she help and the defendant told her \"No but you may be able to help him\" and that was when she saw her husband with his catastrophic injuries and blood all over the floor and walls.' Rogers told police he had hit him at least six times and had intended to kill him. Mr Jones said Rogers told a police officer he didn't need to be handcuffed because he was no threat to the police. '\"I'm only a threat to evil people\" he said and on his way to the police station added \"I've been waiting a long time to kill that man\".' In interview, Rogers said he had been pottering around in his flat that morning before seeing Mr Hatch going past.

Enid\u00a0Hatch's sister Betty Elston (pictured holding a child) was murdered in 1971 by a\u00a0stranger who had absconded from a mental health institution . He added: 'They are using modern technology, the equivalent of witchcraft and he was in collusion with the Main Man.' Sentencing Rogers to a hospital order under the Mental Health Act, Mr Justice Warby said he may never be released. 'On the evidence I have read and heard, it seems there is little likelihood that the doctors would ever consider you safe enough to release into the community.' The judge told Rogers: 'On that day he had got up, made his wife a cup of tea and set off to spread some lawn seed, saying it was a good day to do it. 'He didn't know you were lying in wait to kill him. 'As he went to leave the building you launched a ferocious and unprovoked attack. 'He greeted you with the words 'good morning' and you struck him on the head. 'As he stumbled you hit him again, he collapsed and you hit at least four times until you were sure he was brain dead. 'Enid Hatch had to witness with her own eyes the bloody scene you had created and two neighbours had to witness the aftermath. 'The injuries were so severe that the surgeon told his wife he had never seen such horrific injuries in 20 years of neurosurgery. 'He was a devoted loving and much-loved husband, father and grandfather and this is the family on which you have visited this truly shocking and terrible crime. 'You have brought emotional devastation. Worried Enid Hatch went to look for her husband Fred after he failed to return from the communal garden of their sheltered housing complex near Cardiff. She discovered Rogers standing over her bloodied husband . 'For Enid it was a particularly cruel experience, as she had already suffered the loss of a loved one through murder by a stranger - her sister Betty Elston was murdered on a beach in Sully in 1971 by a stranger who had absconded from a mental health institution.' He told Rogers: 'Expert psychiatric evidence is that your behaviour is explained by paranoid schizophrenia - that is the explanation for the delusions and hallucinations you had which led you to conclude you had a moral duty to kill Mr Hatch.' Speaking after the court hearing, Mr Hatch's family described him as 'a kind, caring, placid gentle man' who will be missed by everyone who knew him. They said: 'Our lives have been changed forever and we are devastated. 'There is no justice that can diminish our loss but we are grateful that Alan Rogers will never have the opportunity to damage another family and cause the pain and hurt that has been inflicted on us.'\n"]}
{"question_id": 532, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Floyd Mayweather v Manny Pacquiao will be the biggest fight of all time financially and the most significant this century. Evaluating the greatest ever fights is a complex variable of several factors including not only the quality and excitement of the action but the political, social and cultural undertones, the scale of expectation and outside influences. Where Money Man v PacMan comes to rank among the most important fights in ring history will depend upon what happens that coming night in the MGM Grand Garden Arena. In this, the fifth in a series of 12 fights that shaped boxing history, I look back on one of the greatest sporting events of all time. THE NEAR-DEATH FIGHT . Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier . The Thrilla in Manila . Quezon City, Philippines . October 1, 1975 . Just as they are saying about Mayweather v Pacquiao, the perceived wisdom was that Ali-Frazier was coming five years too late for two great boxers in their 30s. Let us hope they are so spectacularly wrong again. That star-spangled night in New York when Smokin' Joe knocked down and defeated The Greatest had been followed in 1974 by a tamer, scrappier, points victory for Ali. A poster for Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier, also known as the Thrilla in Manila, in\u00a0Quezon City, Philippines . Ali (right) swings for Frazier, who eventually lost in the 14th round to a technical knockout . And so to the trilogy, a year later. Both men had come through battles with George Foreman, Frazier losing and Ali famously winning The Rumble in the Jungle in Zaire. GEORGE FOREMAN V MUHAMMAD ALI . October 30, 1974, Kinshasa, Zaire . JOE FRAZIER v MUHAMMAD ALI . March 8, 1971, Madison Square Garden, New York . JACK JOHNSON v JAMES JEFFRIES . July 4, 1910, Reno, Nevada . JOE LOUIS v MAX SCHMELING . June 22, 1938, Yankee Stadium, New York . This time Don King had Manila in mind as the next heavyweight stop for his globe-trotting circus. Philippines President Ferdinand Marcos, like Zaire's President Mobuto before him, saw sponsorship of the fight as a distraction from the poverty and social unrest in his country. It was Ali who became most distracted during the build-up. When invited to a photo-opportunity with Marcos and his infamously big-spending wife Imelda, he took his mistress Veronica Porsche along and introduced her as his wife. Mrs Belinda Ali watched that happen on US television and immediately flew to Manila to confront her husband, loudly, in his hotel suite. Ali returned to his customary psychological baiting of his opponents. He had insulted Frazier before their first fight and did so again chanting: 'It will be Killa and a Thrilla and a Chilla when I get The Gorilla in Manila.' Thus the title for the fight, The Thrilla in Manila, was coined. Ali pictured alongside his infamously big-spending wife Mrs Belinda Ali in September 1975 . Frazier, the quiet man, was plotting a strategy of breaking down Ali with shots to the stomach, ribs, kidneys and liver, quoting the old ring maxim: 'If you kill the body, the head will die.' Ali would target the Frazier head and won the early rounds while his legs were at their freshest. But it was impossible for him to keep dancing in the pressure-cooker heat, with the ring temperature reaching 120 degrees Fahrenheit. As Muhammad started slowing, Joe began Smokin'. They would engage in one of the most brutal spectacles in the annals of the hardest game. Ali was forced to lower his guard as they landed more than 100 blows to the head between them, each of such force that any one of them would have stopped lesser fighters. Ali supplemented those power shots with his quick jabs and combinations and thereby inflicted more of the facial swelling. Boxing greats Frazier and Ali pictured in the ring on October 1, 1975, for the Thrilla in Manila . Ali and Frazier\u00a0engaged in one of the most brutal spectacles in the annals of the hardest game . Frazier's eyes began closing in the ninth. By the time he came out for the 13th he could barely see and Ali sent his gum-shield flying with the second of two massive right hooks. Exhausted though he was, Ali went for the Killa in the 14th. Although the monstrous barrage which sent Frazier reeling and staggering could not put him down, it was enough to bring a sensational end to an epic battle. Ali ordered his corner-man Herbert Muhammad to cut off his gloves, saying he could not go on. But before he could do so Frazier's trainer Eddie Futch called a halt. A relieved Ali famously said: 'This is the closest to death I have ever been.' Frazier begged to be allowed to see out the 15th and final round but Futch told him: 'It's over. No-one will ever forget what you did here today.' Frazier never forgave him. Not fully. Nor Ali for the trilogy of insults. Ali defied the rigours of Parkinson's to attend Frazier's funeral. Ali lifts his arms in the air after defeating Frazier in the 14th round, but later attended his great opponent's funeral when he died at the age of 67 .\n"]}

A Florida man wanted as a suspect in the murder of his own mother has been on the run from police since Saturday. Police say Michael Scott Shemansky came to their attention after he failed to appear for a supervised visit with his son on the same day mother\u00a0Sandra Shemansky, 57, was found dead at the home they shared in Winter Garden. The body was discovered at the West Colonial Drive home when an out-of-state family member called in a well-being check. WKMG\u00a0reports that an initial investigation determined there was foul play. 'My biggest concern is that he might come back,' said neighbor Natalie Randall, a resident of the Winter Garden RV Resort. An attorney for his estranged wife confirmed Shemansky's failure to appear for the scheduled visit. He is already on parole for battery on law enforcement, has a history of bipolar mental illness, and was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric ward for an attempted suicide. His mother was there to help him as he went through a divorce. His wife filed a domestic violence injunction against him two years ago, according to her attorney, Diana\u00a0Knowles Dunlop. Neighbors said his mother may have been the one preventing him from making the meeting with his son. Neighbors at the\u00a0Winter Garden RV Resort believe divorce proceedings may have pushed Shemansky over the edge . 'His mom wouldn't allow him to go,' Nathan Tanner told reporters. 'She said because she didn't want him to have no more trouble through the courts.' Tanner added the stress of the divorce proceedings may have pushed him over the edge. 'And he got some paperwork Friday that was, I guess, bad news and I guess that triggered him,' Tanner told WFTV. Authorities have the murder weapon, still not publicly identified, but will not yet confirm how Sandra Shemansky was killed, according to information given to local press by\u00a0Police Lt. Scott Allen. He allegedly was seen going into the trailer park's office and asking for a glass of water shortly after the murder.

The country's chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies is said to be concerned at the number of children suffering from the condition, which is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D. The disease, a scourge of Victorian Britain, was virtually eradicated after the Second World War but is returning as more and more youngsters are used to staying indoors playing video games than going outside. Scroll down for video . Dame Sally Davies, the country's chief medical officer, who has ordered a cost review into giving all under-fours free vitamin D supplements . Now, it has been reported that Professor Davies has ordered the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (Nice) to review the cost of providing vitamin supplements to all children under the age of four, in a bid to reverse the trend. The move is being supported by one of Britain's leading experts on vitamin D deficiency at University College Hospital London Alastair Sutcliffe, who has spoken about an 'epidemic' of cases due to a lack of sun exposure and overuse of sunscreen. He told the Sunday Times: 'Nothing is free but the cost of the ill-effects of deficiency, such as rickets and anaemia from families not providing children with these supplements is greater for the NHS. 'Sunblock is so powerful it does work but you end up with no exposure to the sun. 'The outcome is that you are blocking out sunshine and you have a secondary effect of reduced exposure to sunshine which the human race needs.' Rickets is caused by a deficiency in vitamin D and causes bone deformities such as bowed legs, pictured, and a curvature of the spine . Rickets, which is also known as soft bones, can cause deformities such as bowed legs and a curvature of the spine. During the war children were given food supplements such as cod liver oil, but this practice stopped in the 1950s. An estimated 40 per cent of children are estimated to have vitamin D levels below the recommended amount. Figures from the NHS show there were 833 hospital admissions for children suffering from the condition  in the financial year 2012-13. Professor Davies has previously spoken out about the advantages of giving free vitamins to young children. A scheme has already been set up in deprived areas of Birmingham handing out supplements, which has halved the number of cases of rickets and other deficiency problems. She said: 'We are offering these vitamins to vulnerable children and the take-up is low, but many children not in these communities need them too.' The NHS already recommends all youngsters aged six months to five years take the vitamins, but parents must pay for them unless they are part of the NHS\u2019s means-tested Healthy Start scheme. Professor Davies said the UK\u2019s record on children\u2019s health used to be \u2018one of the best but we are now the worst\u2019. Possible causes include lifestyle behaviours in pregnancy such as smoking, and poor care in infancy. Rickets, or soft and deformed bones, was first noted by physicians in ancient Rome but was not linked with lack of vitamin D until the start of the 20th century. It was common in Victorian times because of lack of access to sunlight \u2013 which the body needs to make vitamin D \u2013 and poor diets. It mostly disappeared in the West during the 1940s thanks to the fortification of foods such as margarine, and children were also routinely given cod liver oil. Rickets is still a major problem in third-world countries. However, UK cases have been rising in the past 15 years, from 183 in 1996 to 762 in 2011. Experts believe this is partly because children are eating less fish and eggs than in the past. They also blame extensive use of sunscreen, and children spending more time indoors.\n"]}

But John Doyle, 79, was left with a punctured lung and a broken rib after he was beaten up by an angry driver during a terrifying road rage attack. The grandfather was ushering two 12-year-old girls across the road when businessman Genti Rustemi, 45, drove over the crossing point without slowing. Genti Rustemi, 45, (left) left John Doyle, 79, (right) with a broken rib and a punctured lung after attacking the lollipop man as he helped children cross the road to get to school . Mr Doyle was helping youngsters cross the road to Wellington School in Timperley, Greater Manchester (pictured), where his wife is a dinnerlady . To show his disapproval, Mr Doyle tapped his lollipop stick on the roof of the BMW as it hurtled past and then, when the driver stopped, told him to be more careful. But after Rustemi had dropped off his daughter at a different school, he returned to the crossing minutes later in a fit of temper and attacked Mr Doyle, who was still helping pupils cross the road. As children and parents looked on in horror, the incensed businessman threw a punch towards Mr Doyle\u2019s face. It failed to connect but managed to knock off his glasses. He then punched Mr Doyle in the chest causing him to fall over backwards into the road where he sat gasping for breath. The former pub landlord was taken to hospital where he was found to have suffered a fractured rib and a punctured lung. Kosovo-born Rustemi, from Stockport, escaped a jail sentence this week after admitting assault causing actual bodily harm and dangerous driving. Instead, he was handed a six-month suspended jail term, ordered to pay Mr Doyle \u00a32,000 in compensation, told to carry out 200 hours of unpaid work and banned from the roads for 12 months. Mr Doyle (pictured at the scene of the attack) was helping two 12 year old girls across the road outside their school, when Rustemi drove over the crossing without slowing . Mr Doyle took the post as a 'patrol crossing officer' three years ago to to stave off boredom during retirement . Mr Doyle, who has been married for 55 years to Jean, 80, a dinner lady, took the job as a \u2018patrol crossing officer\u2019 three years ago to stave off boredom during retirement. Minshull Street Crown Court in Manchester heard that the incident happened at 8.30am on January 20 while he was working outside Wellington School, a secondary school, in Timperley, Greater Manchester. Yesterday Mr Doyle, who had to take six weeks off work following the attack, said: \u2018It was an extraordinary thing. I\u2019ve spent most of my working life in the licence trade so I\u2019ve had to escort my fair share of people from my premises but this was something else. 'What he did was like going through a red light. Both myself and the children could have been run over. I\u2019ve been verbally abused in the past but I never expected to get hit. \u2018But I\u2019ll keep doing lollipop patrols until I stop enjoying it, and that\u2019s even after getting a punctured lung. I love the job and love meeting people. I\u2019ve got no plans to stop yet.\u2019 Mr Doyle, who was sent this get well soon card by pupils, said he plans to continue his job as a lollipop man despite being injured by Rustemi . Speaking of the incident, he said: 'I had dropped my lollipop down to draw the driver's attention to the fact I was in the middle of the road with two schoolchildren. 'But he was only about 18 inches away from me as he went by. He asked me what the bloody hell I thought I was doing. I said, \"didn't you see me standing on the road?\" He said \"no\" so I said, \"you should bloody well open your eyes then.\" Rustemi tried to argue that Mr Doyle had been the 'aggressor' during the incident, but police took statements from a number of schoolchildren witnesses who said the opposite . 'He drove off and I thought that was it then three or four minutes later he came charging across the road towards me and hit me in the side. Much to my mortification I collapsed. 'I have never experienced anything quite like that. It was just not being able to stand up at again. I was lying on the floor and couldn't stand up. I had to crawl across the pavement to a wall and hauled myself up against it and by this time I had people around me. I didn't think there was proper injury at that point, I was just deeply ashamed that I had fallen and couldn't stand up again. 'It wasn't until later in hospital having an X-ray they discovered that I had broken my rib. I can't imagine anybody would drive away, park the car and come charging back because of a sudden burst of temper. This must have been something that was festering for one reason or another.' Sentencing him the judge Mr Recorder David Heaton QC said: 'You behaved in a way in front of your daughter and in front of other schoolchildren which is repugnant to right-minded people. You drove along the road and it appears you failed to see Mr Doyle, the school crossing patrol man, who at that time was escorting two 12-year-old girls across the road. 'So frustrated was he by your driving that he, perhaps unwisely, allowed his crossing banner to drop on to your vehicle and no doubt that surprised your daughter and caused you to exchange words with him. If matters had rested there I imagine you would not be here. Foolishly, you went away but returned two minutes later, more angry, it appears, than you were previously, and threw a punch at Mr Doyle. 'He was carrying out a public service escorting schoolchildren safely from one side of the road to the other and is a much older man. I am prepared to accept you did not realise at the time but nonetheless an inexcusable feature was his age. 'The service he performed is one which parents of children up and down the country value every morning of the school term. You assaulted a public servant, you did it in front of children in the morning and to a man who was significantly older than you. I note you have not been well and that might be some sort of explanation for this extraordinary behaviour.'\n"]}

That inauguration came and went and Schieffer stayed. He was enjoying the job too much. The death of NBC's Tim Russert, whose 'Meet the Press' led in the ratings for many years, opened Sunday morning to a tighter competition. 'Face the Nation' often led, and CBS responded by expanding the show to an hour. 'I know what you're thinking,' CBS News President David Rhodes said in a memo to his staff Tuesday. 'Bob's thought about retiring before, is he really retiring now? And of course with his long connection to CBS News we'd be happy to learn that he's not leaving now, or that he can be seen by our viewers in the future.' But Rhodes said Schieffer wanted to announce the end of his career where it all began. Rhodes called him 'an inspiration and a mentor to so many colleagues - and, frankly, to me.' CBS would not talk Tuesday about potential successors at 'Face the Nation.' Schieffer hasn't had a single substitute when he took time off; Charlie Rose, Norah O'Donnell, Major Garrett, John Dickerson and Nancy Cordes have all filled in at different times. His chief competitors are Chuck Todd at 'Meet the Press' and George Stephanopoulos at ABC's 'This Week.' Rhodes told Politico '[Schieffer] felt very strongly about doing this at TCU. He's been really deveoted to us, he's had such a long career here - but he's also made a huge investment in TCU. 'His wife is still on the board, his name is on both the journalism and the communications school. He and I have been talking about this for a long time.' CBS News quoted Schieffer as saying Wednesday 'We like any large organization we have had our ups and downs; we're on a high right now. 'Face the Nation,' I think, is better than it has ever been.'

{"question_id": 538, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)The reserve deputy who shot a suspect with his firearm rather than his stun gun, and another deputy who can be heard cursing at the suspect after he was shot, were not in their normal states of mind because of the elevated stress of apprehending the suspect, according to a Tulsa, Oklahoma, investigator. Tulsa Police Sgt. Jim Clark, who has been brought in to review the case, said Tulsa County Reserve Deputy Robert Bates, 73, \"inadvertently\" shot Eric Courtney Harris after Harris -- a possibly PCP-addled felon who had days prior sold methamphetamine to an undercover officer -- ran from authorities after trying to sell an illegal handgun during an undercover sting. As deputies tried to handcuff Harris, Bates arrived with a pepper spray gun in hand. He warned his fellow deputies he was going to use a Taser on the suspect, but instead, he fired a single gunshot -- and immediately apologized, Clark said, citing a recently released video. Clark attributed Bates' actions to a phenomenon known as \"slip and capture.\" An example is when someone who drives a car with a manual transmission gets behind the wheel of a car with an automatic transmission. The driver will press her or his left foot down when stopping abruptly, even though there's no clutch pedal, he said. Quoting Bill Lewinski, executive director of the Force Science Institute, Clark further explained: \"These are mistakes that are made when you think you are doing one thing but you actually are doing another, and the result often is directly opposite of what you intended. In effect, your intended behavior slips off the path that you want it to go because it is captured by a stronger response and sent to a different direction.\" Bates announced that he was going to deploy his Taser, and he pulled the trigger only once, as he was trained to do, Clark said. Police are trained to \"double-tap\" when firing their handguns, he said. The gun jumped out of Bates' hand because he wasn't expecting recoil, Clark said, and Bates expressed surprise and remorse that he had shot Harris. Quoting Lewinski again, Clark said, \"This is the slip and capture. Under time pressure to address a perceived threat, his intention to draw his Taser slipped off his agenda, so to speak, when it was captured and completed by a more well-rehearsed motor program. ... He was not conscious of this unfortunate switch until after the shot was fired. In his urgency, his concentration was focused exclusively on Harris' back, where he intended to place the Taser darts. Because of what's called 'inattentional blindness,' meaning that he wasn't consciously paying attention to and registering it, he wouldn't have been aware that the feel of the gun was different from that of the Taser. And in this case the weight of the gun and Taser are nearly identical.\" Clark was emphatic that Bates had done nothing criminally wrong and went so far as to say the reserve deputy was a victim. \"Reserve Deputy Bates did not commit a crime. Reserve Deputy Bates was a victim, a true victim of slip and capture,\" he said. \"There's no other determination I could come to.\" When they set up the undercover sting, police wanted evidence on camera. But when they recorded the operation targeting Harris earlier this month, cameras continued to roll as the suspect ran, and as he was fatally shot. The Tulsa County Sheriff's Office released the video on Friday. The shooting was an apparent accident, it has said. In the last minutes of the video, Harris lies on the pavement with police on top of him. An officer calls for a Taser, but in place of an electric clicking sound, a gunshot rings out. A voice can be heard saying, \"Oh! I shot him! I'm sorry!\"  Another officer screams out, \"He shot him! He shot him!\" Harris, who is bleeding, calls out, too. He's losing his breath, he says. An officer yells back at him. \"You f**king ran! Shut the f**k up!\" he yells. \"F**k your breath,\" he said. Clark defended the officer's language, saying the deputy experienced auditory exclusion, never heard the gunshot and thought the suspect was out of breath from running. The language has no bearing on whether the shooting was justified, Clark said. \"One deputy thought he was going to have to shoot this person at the arrest site. It's very upsetting when you think you are going to have to take someone's life and this deputy, one of the involved deputies, was upset,\" he said. \"Secondly, this is total stress. They are going after a dangerous suspect that they have no idea whether or not this person is armed.\" Clark added, \"They did not know that he was shot at this time. They had audio exclusion. They was at a point where they couldn't hear. They didn't even hear the gunshot go off. The officers did not know that Mr. Harris had been shot.\" An officer can be seen in the video taking his foot off an object lying on the pavement not far from Harris. Shortly after the suspect is shot, the officers begin tugging Harris' hands behind his back as the video ends. Harris later died at a local hospital. Police said at the time of the shooting that Harris admitted to medics at the scene that he may have been under the influence of phencyclidine, a street drug commonly known as PCP. The video is edited to block out the officers' faces. Harris is clearly visible. Minutes earlier, Harris had climbed into a truck cab, where an undercover officer had set up a camera on the dash to record the suspect. \"What's up?\" they greet each other cordially. Without missing a beat, Harris rummages deep in a backpack and hastily hands over a semiautomatic pistol. Every few seconds, he looks around outside nervously. \"Sweet, that's a nice gun, man,\" the undercover officer says off camera. It's a \"German Luger,\" Harris tells him. He cranes his head around quickly and watches as a car pulls up next to the truck. Officers in uniform jump out, and Harris bolts out the passenger door and sprints off. \"He's running; he's running, he's running!\" the officer in the truck says. As Harris fled, police worried he might still be armed because he ran with his right forearm pressed against his hip, \"consistent with trying to maintain control of a gun,\" Clark said, adding that no gun was found when Harris was searched after the chase. Another video from an officer's body camera picks up the chase. The officer wearing it jumps out of a vehicle and pursues Harris on foot, catching up to him easily. He tackles the fleeing suspect. The officer commands him, \"I need you to roll on your stomach. Now!\" Other officers appear. Someone calls, \"Taser! Taser!\" The gun discharges. Much later in the recording made by the first camera inside the truck, two men are conversing. \"He thought it was his Taser,\" one of them says, as the other curses in frustration. In the background, a woman is crying \"No, no, no!\" Harris had come to the sting deal with a female companion. Police have said that Harris had reached for his waistband, and officers feared he might endanger them. When Harris was on the ground, he \"refused to pull his left arm from underneath his body where his hand was near his waistband,\" they said after the shooting. The officer's body camera video did not reveal that area of Harris' body. Bates, a former Tulsa police officer, was placed on administrative leave after the shooting, the sheriff's office has said. Asked whether Bates' age may have been a factor in the shooting, Clark said, \"It's happened to 21-year-old law enforcement officers. It's happened to 30-year-old law enforcement officers. Age is not really a factor in consideration for the dynamics behind slip and capture events. Despite the details released over the weekend, Harris' brother says he still want answers. \"I want to know if he was shot in the back accidentally or on purpose. These are all the things that not only I want, but the public wants,\" Andre Harris told CNN affiliate KTUL. Bates' attorney, Scott Wood, told CNN on Friday he would contact the network later. He had not issued a statement or called back as of Sunday. CNN's Jason Morris, Carma Hassan and Andreas Preuss contributed to this report.\n"]}
{"question_id": 539, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: By the time Cesc Fabregas was replaced in the final minute, the mask had gone and the jeers had melted into applause. The appreciative majority overwhelmed the vocal minority to offer a tribute to the Phantom of the Emirates, one of the finest creative midfielders to have worn an Arsenal shirt in the modern era. It\u2019s true they had booed his every touch and perhaps the loudest cheer of the game followed his yellow card for a dive but for Arsenal it is time to stop being haunted by those they have lost or failed to sign and support those they have. Cesc Fabregas was booed by large portions of the Arsenal supporters upon his return to the Emirates . Fabregas was cheered - albeit sarcastically - by the same set of fans when he was booked for diving . However when the Chelsea midfielder was substituted in the dying moments he was given an applause . Hull (away) - May 4 . Swansea (home) - May 11 . Man United (away) - May 17 . Sunderland (home) May 20 . West Brom (home) - May 24 . There have been genuine signs of promise in N5 and reasons for optimism in 2015, even if Arsene Wenger was unable to add what would have been a significant other by ending his winless run against Jose Mourinho. It is 13 games and counting, and while the Arsenal boss insists it matters not a jot, it is much to Mourinho\u2019s amusement. \u2018It\u2019s about our club and our team, not about me,\u2019 said Wenger. \u2018We wanted to win the game for the club. What is important is what happens on the football pitch. Arsenal are third in the Premier League, level on points with Manchester City but with a game in hand . \u2018We want to finish the season well. Every game is difficult but we need to keep the focus until the end of the season. We want to secure the top four, then the top three and the top two, before the FA Cup final.\u2019 To finish as runners-up, for the first time in a decade, and successfully defend the FA Cup, can be framed as progress. More significant is the development of Hector Bellerin, Francis Coquelin and Nacho Monreal. Together with a philosophical tweak, it has made Arsenal a more solid defensive unit, capable of taking points from Manchester City and Chelsea and winning at Manchester United in the FA Cup. Coquelin and Monreal were both ready to make smart fouls at the expense of yellow cards to stop the visitors as they sought to counter quickly. This is not a typical Arsenal trait. Bellerin has been outstanding and few have contained Eden Hazard this season as effectively as the teenager did on Sunday, but Arsenal need more defensive protection and plan to prioritise a defensive midfielder and a new goalkeeper in the summer. \u2018We have closed the gap since the start of the season,\u2019 said Wenger. \u2018But what happened is that they had the experience at the back and could close the game down. \u2018The build-up was quick and sharp but the final ball wasn\u2019t there.\u2019 With five to play, Arsenal trail the champions-elect by 10 points and must concentrate on catching Chelsea in the knowledge their rivals from the capital\u2019s west will strengthen again in the summer. Amid the progress, there remain reasons for concern. Despite the flair overload of Mesut Ozil, Alexis Sanchez and Santi Cazorla, they could not break down a Mourinho team determined to protect their clean sheet. Spanish defender Hector Bellerin (left) has come on leaps and bounds for the Gunners this season . Francis Coquelin of Arsenal evades Fabregas of Chelsea during the 0-0 draw at Emirates Stadium on Sunday . Ozil had glimpses of goal, but Branislav Ivanovic did to Sanchez what Bellerin did to Hazard. Chelsea finished the game with a midfield trio of Nemanja Matic, Kurt Zouma and Ramires, which together with their usually resolute back four amounted to a seven-man defensive shield. In the Sky Sports studio, Arsenal legend Thierry Henry questioned the quality of 18-goal striker Olivier Giroud. \u2018Wenger has to strengthen,\u2019 said Henry. \u2018In order to win the league you need great players. I don\u2019t think you can win the league with Giroud. Nacho Monreal (left) is among the Gunners players who have impressed recently and did so against Chelsea . \u2018Chelsea struggled last year but they went out to buy (Thibaut) Courtois, Cesc, Matic and (Diego) Costa. You see today the difference between a team that did and a team that didn\u2019t strengthen. Arsenal still need four top players.\u2019 Those four would be straight down the spine of the team. Imagine Arsenal if you threaded Courtois, John Terry, Matic and Costa through the centre of their fast and fluent side. Arsenal do not long for a Fabregas. They have players who can offer his vision and passing range. Perhaps the supporters who applauded him from the pitch have come to accept this. Thierry Henry said Arsenal will not win the Premier League if they do not buy another striker . But Chelsea do have individuals who would offer extra physical presence and match-winning know-how which would provide a platform for those like Ozil, Sanchez and Cazorla to deliver. Henry must realise this is not the Wenger way but time for nurturing is running out. The Arsenal manager has two more years on what could be his final contract. If he is to close the gap, catch Chelsea next season and end this hoodoo against Mourinho, then it must be done in the summer transfer market.\n"]}
{"question_id": 540, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Disgraced former CIA Director David Petraeus will not go to jail for\u00a0giving his mistress classified material while she was working on a book about him, a judge ruled today. The former U.S. Army General, whose career was destroyed when the affair with Paula Broadwell emerged in November 2012, avoided jail time at the hearing in Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday\u00a0and was instead sentenced to two years probation. He was also fined $100,000 - more than double the $40,000 his attorneys had requested. While Petraeus had agreed two months ago to plead guilty to a misdemeanor count of unauthorized removal and retention of classified material, he formally entered his plea during Thursday's hearing. Petraeus was wearing his wedding ring but there was no sign of his wife, Holly. He told the court he wanted to apologize to those closest to him 'for the pain my actions caused'. Apologies: Former CIA director David Petraeus apologized for his 'mistakes' as he spoke outside the North Carolina courthouse where he was sentenced to two years probation on Thursday afternoon . Sentenced: As well as the probation, he was fined $100,000 for leaking classified information to his mistress . Following the hearing, he briefly addressed the media outside the courthouse. 'As I did in the past, I apologize for those closest to me and many others,' he said, before thanking his supporters including his family, colleagues and fellow veterans. 'I now look forward to moving on with the next phase of my life and with continuing to serve our great nation as a private citizen,' he added. Critics have noted that in other cases concerning government leaks, defendants have received far harsher punishments than Petraeus. CIA analyst John Kiriakou who is serving 30 months behind bars for revealing the secret CIA torture program. Ben Wizner, an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who represents Edward Snowden, told Reuters that he was not against lighter sentences - as long as such treatment is handed out equally. 'The problem is not that David Petraeus is getting lenient treatment,' Wizner said. 'The problem is that lenient treatment is only available to people in high places.' Petraeus was also given special conditions for his probation. He is allowed to travel internationally with his probation officer's approval, for example, and is allowed to possess firearms. He is allowed to pay the $100,000 fine $25,000 per month until it is paid in full. Going solo: Petraeus, who was seen wearing his wedding ring to  court, was not accompanied by his wife Holly to the sentencing hearing. It emerged in 2012 that he had been having an affair with his biographer . Petraeus has 14 days to file an appeal if he wants to dispute the sentencing. In the previous agreement, prosecutors said that while Broadwell was writing her book in 2011, Petraeus gave her eight binders of classified material he had improperly kept from his time as the top military commander in Afghanistan. Days later, he took the binders back to his house. Among the secret information contained in the 'black books' were the names of covert operatives, the coalition war strategy and notes about Petraeus' discussions with President Barack Obama and the National Security Council, prosecutors said. Those binders were later seized by the FBI in an April 2013 search of Petraeus' Arlington, Virginia, home, where he had kept them in the unlocked drawer of a desk in a ground-floor study. Prosecutors said that after resigning from the CIA in November 2012, Petraeus had signed a form falsely attesting he had no classified material. He also lied to FBI agents by denying he supplied the information to Broadwell, according to court documents. Affair: Petraeus gave his mistress Paula Broadwell, pictured together in 2011, classified material that he had improperly kept from his time in the military. She was writing his biography at the time . Petraeus, a four-star general who served as commander of the U.S. Forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, resigned from the CIA in 2012 when the affair emerged but always denied criminal wrongdoing. Broadwell, now 42, met Petraeus, 62, while she was a graduate student at Harvard University, where she was working on a dissertation about him. She wrote his biography, 'All In: The Education of General David Petraeus', which afforded them considerable time together. They carried on an affair between late 2011 and the summer of 2012. But the relationship was later uncovered whiled the FBI investigated claims that one of Petraeus' friends, Florida socialite Jill Kelley, was receiving threatening emails. The messages were found to have been sent by Broadwell, a married mother-of-two. As agents investigated Broadwell's email account, they uncovered the affair and learned the CIA director had shared classified information with her. Petraeus, who remains married to wife Holly, acknowledged the affair as he stepped down, while in May 2013, Broadwell, who is also still married, finally issued an apology for the relationship. 'I have remorse for the harm that this has caused, the sadness it has caused my family and other families,' she told her local station, WSOC. Hurt: Paula Broadwell remains married to husband Scott, pictured together left in 2012, while Petraeus is married to wife Holly, right, despite the affair that forced him to step down as CIA chief in 2012 . 'I'm very blessed. Blessed with an awesome family, a wonderful community that's been a great part of my rehabilitation, if you will. Even when you've made mistakes in life you can still contribute and pick up the stuff and move on.' Petraeus\u00a0held the CIA post less than a year, not long enough to leave a significant mark on the spy agency. The core of his identity has been a military man. He was brought in by President George W. Bush to command multinational forces in Iraq in 2007, a period when the war began to turn in favor of the U.S. Petraeus' command coincided with the 'surge' of American forces in Iraq and a plan to pay Sunni militias to fight al-Qaeda in Iraq. With American help, the Sunni tribes were able to push out insurgents and enable U.S. troops to withdraw in 2011. Those same Sunni areas are now controlled by the Islamic State group, which evolved from the remnants of al-Qaida after Iraqi's Shiite-led government proved weak.\n"]}

O'Neill leaped into the public spotlight last autumn, coming forward to identify himself as the solider previously known only as The Shooter on Veterans' Day last winter. He spoke at length to Fox News about his exploits in a two-part documentary, and has made numerous speaking engagements since. However, his public discussions of a top-secret mission have angered many in the SEALs, including top commanders who said he was breaking the organization's code of honor by seeking fame.

Ten-year-old Martha had been with her owner on the beach in Leasowe in Merseyside and was paddling in the water when she was caught out by a strong current. And with the strength of the outgoing tide, the dog was rapidly swept out to sea with her owner launching their own rescue attempt. New Brighton RNLI crew spot golden retriever Martha in the water after she was swept out to sea by the tide . The crew members lean over the side of the lifeboat as they attempt to pluck Martha from the freezing water . But as they were unable to save their pet, New Brighton's RNLI crew were called and managed to find Martha who was cold and shivering. They then pulled the dog on to the lifeboat after managing to grab her by the collar. The lifeboat's senior helmsman Dave Lowe said: 'Although sea conditions were calm it was still very difficult to spot the dog. Martha was successfully pulled on to the lifeboat after being found cold and shivering  half a mile out to sea . The pet is brought to shore by the RNLI, who have warned about the importance of owners not attempting to rescue their pets, who get into difficulty at sea . 'When we eventually reached her we just managed to get hold of her collar then got her into the lifeboat. 'Although she had been swimming well she was cold and shivering and we wrapped her up in survival bag and calmed her down then took her to the lifeboat station where we were met by her very relieved owner.'

Ian Thornton, deputy launch authority at New Brighton who oversaw the RNLI operation from shore added: 'This is the second dog rescue in recent weeks with the strong potential of the owners going in to the sea to attempt a rescue, fortunately this time it did not end in tragedy. 'It also follows on from a series of call outs to assist dog walkers who have been cut off by the tide in recent months. 'We cannot stress once again the importance of knowing the local tide times. In this area the tides come in fast via gullies so people end up cut off from shore several hours before high tide. ' When high tide is passed then the tide retreats equally quickly with many strong and dangerous currents ready to sweep humans and animals away.'\n"]}

The League One leaders managed to come away from second-placed Preston North End unscathed, drawing 1-1 thanks to Aaron Wilbraham\u2019s equaliser after Jermaine Beckford had opened the scoring just before the hour. Regardless, Steve Cotterill\u2019s side had been destined not to seal promotion at Deepdale because results elsewhere didn\u2019t go their way. Bristol City manager Steve Cotterill was happy to avoid defeat against Preston on Saturday . Three points at Bradford on Tuesday will do the trick. It would take something to go seriously awry for the Robins not to be returning to the second tier after a two-year absence, and they did their job well enough to prevent any late scares in the north west. \u2018That\u2019ll be good,\u2019 Cotterill said. \u2018We\u2019ll digest that and try and prepare properly for the game. \u2018It was important not to get beat here. If you look at it, if we had and then got nothing at Bradford (on Tuesday) then we\u2019re stuck on 88 points. Preston would\u2019ve gone to 83 points today and then have Gillingham at home. \u2018You always look at the worst case scenario.\u2019 Bristol City\u2019s elevation to the second tier appears a formality, and Preston remain in pole position to join them.

Footage this week emerged showing the Liverpool forward inhaling nitrous oxide, a legal high commonly known as laughing gas because it creates feelings of euphoria . But Sherwood said: \u2018Let's hope he's not laughing after Sunday.\u2019 Aston Villa boss Tim Sherwood is hoping they can cause a FA Cup semi-final shock vs Liverpool on Sunday . Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season . The Aston Villa manager knows his ambitions to beat Liverpool and reach the FA Cup final may rest on taming Sterling, a player he tried to sign for Tottenham Hotpur\u2019s academy as a schoolboy. The 20-year-old is enduring a tough time off the pitch, in a contract stand-off with Liverpool and coming under question for his recreational activities. Sterling has been pictured smoking shisha pipes as well as taking so-called \u2018hippy crack\u2019 through a balloon. Sherwood said that was wrong but added: \u2018I have a wee bit of sympathy. I am not condoning it, but he is a young man, isn\u2019t he? He obviously has fortunes but is growing up like everyone else. It is tough in the public eye.\u2019 Sherwood can remember being wowed by a 14-year-old Sterling on the books at Queens Park Rangers, but was unable to convince Spurs to commit the money required to sign him. Instead, Sterling headed to Anfield for \u00a3600,000 in 2010. \u2018A lot of academies pick players on size because the bigger kids normally push the little kids over and their teams can win the games,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018He wouldn\u2019t be much different from what he is now but you wouldn\u2019t want to fight him would you?\u2019 Sherwood has been a fan of Liverpool starlet Sterling (left) ever since he was 14 and on the books at QPR . Another Liverpool player Sherwood discussed on Friday was Steven Gerrard, whose birthday falls on the FA Cup final on May 30. Those associated with the Merseyside club feel an ideal silverware send-off is brewing before Gerrard heads to LA Galaxy. \u2018Believe it or not it\u2019s not about spoiling the party for Steven Gerrard,\u2019 insisted Sherwood. \u2018It\u2019s about what we can do. To be honest we\u2019re hoping he\u2019s on his holiday in May.\u2019 Sherwood played against a teenage Gerrard in his latter days and hailed the 34-year-old\u2019s clear talent from the off. He added: \u2018I\u2019m sure Steven could still do a job for a Premier League side but I\u2019m not sure he can go and play for anyone other than Liverpool. He can earn \u00a31 a week or \u00a3200,000, he\u2019ll still play the same way. That\u2019s a dying breed \u2013 there aren\u2019t many of them about.\u2019 Sherwood has led a Villa resurgence since taking over in February, steering the club away from relegation danger and into this Wembley showpiece. They are on a run of four wins in seven. Liverpool have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for the FA Cup semi after serving a three-match ban .

{"question_id": 546, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Over the years I\u2019ve been lucky enough to play with a lot of accomplished women golfers, including two former world No 1's in Lorena Ochoa and Laura Davies. But none of these encounters prepared me for playing 18 holes with Charley Hull, the best teenage golfer in Britain. Suffice to say: I knew she was good but I didn\u2019t appreciate she was so damn good. The venue was Turnberry and a media day for the Ricoh Women\u2019s British Open in July. The sun was shining, Ailsa Craig was shimmering in the distance and Hull put on a shot-making clinic. Charley Hull can make it to the very top of the women's game if she carries on her progression . Teenager Hull possesses the same \u2018wow\u2019 factor as world No 1 Rory McIlroy (below) One of the nice things for me about playing golf with the women pros is we usually hit the ball about the same length. Not on this day. Hull hit drives that pitched past mine. She positively exudes the \u2018wow\u2019 factor Rory McIlroy had at the same age. Like Rory, she\u2019s also easy company. Normally the way these things work is for the journalist to kick start conversations but Hull asked more questions than I did. She wanted to know everything about the course, from the historic role of the celebrated lighthouse to the war memorial that offers sober reflection to golfers on the back nine. The 19-year-old was keen to know about the revamp planned by the Trump family, who recently purchased Turnberry, under the guidance of course architect Martin Ebert. Again, like Rory, there\u2019s the requisite amount of steel. \u2018I\u2019d hit a five iron off this tee to stay short of the bunkers,\u2019 advised her caddy Gary Wildman, on the opening hole. \u2018No, I want to hit a driver,\u2019 replied Hull. She hit a driver. Indeed, she hit a driver off every tee, which is the way she likes to do things in practice. \u2018I just find taking on the holes makes me concentrate,\u2019 she explained. Again, like Rory, the driver also happens to be the best club in her bag. The 19-year-old has the same mentality and 'wow factor' as world No 1 Rory McIlroy . It puts her in the vanguard of the next revolution set to sweep the women\u2019s game. After the emergence of the Koreans and the revival of the Americans, get set for the power hitters to leave their mark in the same way their male counterparts hold sway in the men\u2019s version. Hull is part of a group that includes Thai rookie Ariya Jutanugarn and American Lexi Thompson. Hull has added 25 yards to her drive since hooking up with swing coach Matt Belsham earlier this year. Again, like McIlroy \u2014 there could be a theme here \u2014 her swing is so good she uses blade irons (she might be the only woman to do so), which are the preserve of the technically sound. American Lexi Thompson is another highly-touted golfer in women's golf and will challenge Hull . What\u2019s next for the girl from Kettering who plays at Woburn and who finished No 1 in Europe last year, the youngest to do so? She has now earned her privileges to play in America and clearly that is the next proving ground. Her plan is to be the best player in the world at 21 \u2014 the year McIlroy reached the summit \u2014 which might be a tall order given the present incumbent happens to be 13 months younger and won yet again in America on Sunday. Hull speaks in respectful tones about Lydia Ko. They played together in New Zealand recently, where the home favourite shot a course-record 61 to Hull\u2019s 64. \u2018It was just an amazing day, and I hope we have many more,\u2019 said Hull. Hull has ambitions to be the best in the world and she has a good chance of doing just that . The great advantage she will have over Ko going forward is the fact she hits the ball significantly further. But will she hole enough putts to make it count? On this day, she holed nothing of any length and still breezed round the Ailsa Course in 68 strokes. Hull recalled the last time she played Turnberry, in the Health Perception Championship. She was nine at the time, and stood 4ft 7in tall. \u2018This was where I got knocked over by the wind,\u2019 she said, standing on the 11th tee. How typical that she got back up to win the event. A decade on, she\u2019ll take some knocking over this July\u2026 and beyond.\n"]}

Allardyce's side had been on track for their first back-to-back home wins in almost four months but having already had two goals ruled out for offside, Arnautovic eventually punished the fading hosts to earn a draw. Aaron Cresswell had given the home side an early lead at Upton Park but after a strong start it was Stoke who ended up dominating and they left with a deserved point.

It is the fourth time this year that a late goal has cost the ninth-placed Hammers after draws at Manchester United, Tottenham Hotspur and the defeat at Leicester City last week. Without the late goals they could be above Swansea City and sitting on a club-record 50 points. 'We can't find the right key elements to see that game out. We leave ourselves on a nervous edge,' Allardyce said. 'We are very nervous at that stage over what's happened before and we should be on 50 points now. We've thrown away seven points in two minutes or less in four games. 'If we had concentrated better in those (last) minutes, we would be sitting on our greatest total and finish ever in the (Premier) League. Instead we are scratching our heads on when are we going to finish a game out again. I thought we were going to do it today, but it finished miserably in the end over just a few seconds.' West Ham's performances have dipped since a strong start to the season but there was no sign of any supposed complacency early on against Stoke, and the reawakening coincided with the return of Enner Valencia. It was Stoke's inability to deal with him led to the opening goal after seven minutes. Glenn Whelan tripped Valencia five yards outside the penalty area to give West Ham an opportunity to shoot from the dead ball. Mark Noble looked the most likely candidate and when he stepped over the ball it seemed to leave goalkeeper Asmir Begovic confused. Instead, unlikely scorer Cresswell was the chosen one and he sent the free-kick over the wall and curling into the Bosnian stopper's top left-hand corner to give West Ham the lead with his second goal of the season.

West Ham were well on top, and Diafra Sakho and Cheikhou Kouyate could have added to the lead inside the opening 20 minutes. But as the half wore on it was Stoke who looked the more likely to score. Valencia's influence waned and instead it was Arnautovic who took control, dominating Cresswell down West Ham's left-hand side. Charlie Adam curled an ambitious free-kick over the bar from 40 yards out in search of his second wonder goal in a week before Jonathan Walters silenced an impatient Upton Park with a low strike that looked to have gone in but had instead hit Adrian's side netting. Victor Moses also had an opportunity, bringing down Arnautovic's cross inside the penalty area, spinning and firing in a shot that was deflected just wide. Allardyce would have been pleased just to see his side make it through to half-time unscathed and Stoke went in at the break with a sense of injustice after hearing referee Roger East blow his whistle as they prepared for the latest in a series of dangerous corners. A low-key opening to the second half allowed the home side to settle a bit and they looked the better side until a mistake by Winston Reid gave Adam a chance on the hour mark but a bobble came to the rescue and the Scot shot wide.

But the Austrian wasn't to be denied and he eventually scored with seconds left to spark wild celebrations in front of the away end. Stephen Ireland flicked the ball on and Arnautovic applied the finish, slipping the ball into the corner to leave a familiar scene for the home support.

His comments to The New York Times, published on Sunday, come amid criticism from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of the deal that the United States and five other world powers struck with Iran. Tehran agreed to halt the country's nuclear ambitions, and in exchange, Western powers would drop sanctions that have hurt the Iran's economy. Obama said he understands and respects Netanyahu's stance that Israel is particularly vulnerable and doesn't \"have the luxury of testing these propositions\" in the deal. \"But what I would say to them is that not only am I absolutely committed to making sure they maintain their qualitative military edge, and that they can deter any potential future attacks, but what I'm willing to do is to make the kinds of commitments that would give everybody in the neighborhood, including Iran, a clarity that if Israel were to be attacked by any state, that we would stand by them,\" Obama said. That, he said, should be \"sufficient to take advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see whether or not we can at least take the nuclear issue off the table,\" he said. The framework negotiators announced last week would see Iran reduce its centrifuges from 19,000 to 5,060, limit the extent to which uranium necessary for nuclear weapons can be enriched and increase inspections. The talks over a final draft are scheduled to continue until June 30. But Netanyahu and Republican critics in Congress have complained that Iran won't have to shut down its nuclear facilities and that the country's leadership isn't trustworthy enough for the inspections to be as valuable as Obama says they are. Obama said even if Iran can't be trusted, there's still a case to be made for the deal. \"In fact, you could argue that if they are implacably opposed to us, all the more reason for us to want to have a deal in which we know what they're doing and that, for a long period of time, we can prevent them from having a nuclear weapon,\" Obama said.\n"]}

Renault's Cyril Abiteboul (left) has promised Red Bull that the engine problems will be resolved . 'We knew there was a weakness, so there was a plan in place,' said Abiteboul. 'We need to make sure the plan is good enough for the size of the issues we have had, and whether it can be addressed fairly quickly. 'I'm not quite sure, from a logistical perspective, it could be addressed for this weekend's race in Bahrain. 'But certainly our aim has been to have absolutely no reliability issues by Monaco. 'We knew the first engine we built had some reliability weaknesses, and unfortunately we saw that in China. Unhappy Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz threatened to pull out of Formula One . 'The plan is to make sure the future engine we will be building has absolutely no reliability issues.' That is of little comfort to Horner who goes into the fourth race of the season with one of his drivers having used two engines when only four are allowed per season otherwise penalties start to be applied. 'I don't think anybody expected us to be on engine three after race three in any of our scenarios,' said an unhappy Horner. 'We accept sometimes to find performance you've got to take some risks. Calculated risks are what Red Bull has always bought into. Daniil Kvyat's Red Bull and the Toro Rosso of Max Verstappen both suffered a power-unit failure in China . 'But the frustrating thing for both parties is we're in this situation with three of our allotted four engines in use going into race four. 'It isn't where we wanted to be, but we've got to work our way out of it.' Asked as to how he would manage this weekend given the fear of yet another engine failure, Horner replied: 'You've just got to go for it and hope for the best.'\n"]}

Father-of-one Szilveszter, 24, who now lives in Bolton, feared he would never be able to have more children after the DIY procedure left him unable to have sex. He said: 'I had to stop having sex with my wife as it's too painful. I would like to have more children but if I can't have sex I may lose my family. Father-of-one Szilveszter injected\u00a0petroleum jelly into his penis as he wanted to make it bigger. Instead it became so swollen and inflammed, he was unable to have sex and was in constant pain . 'Every day is difficult for me as it's very painful and bleeding. This was the worst mistake in my life as I don't feel like a real man.' Hungarian born Szilveszter shares his story on the latest series of TLC show Extreme Beauty Disasters. He said he had Vaseline injected into his penis following a friend's recommendation. He explains: 'I said to my friend I want to lose weight as I think my penis is small. He said you don't need to lose weight, I can help you. My friend injected in my penis Vaseline. Afterwards I was happy as it looked bigger.' But nine months later, his penis was swollen, painful and bleeding. He went to his GP and saw other doctors but all told him there was nothing they could do. Cosmetic surgeon Dr Vik Vijh, left, said injecting Vaseline, right, into the body is a very bad idea . Szilveszter turned to Extreme Beauty Disasters resident plastic surgeon Dr Vik Vijh who said there was hope he could be cured - but it wouldn't be easy. After examining Szilveszter Dr Vijh said: 'It's not a pretty slight, it's inflammed, it's sore, it's misshapen, his penis is a disaster.' He added: 'I have been doing plastic surgery now for 20 years and I have never seen anything like this. Injecting petroleum jelly into the penis makes no sense on any level.' Dr Vijh gave Szilveszter an MRI scan which revealed the large, hard bumps around his penis had formed thanks to his body reacting to the invasion of Vaseline. Dr Vijh explained: 'Your body has formed scar tissue around the Vaseline because it's a foreign body, your body is trying to ward it off and it gives you these painful lumps, it will soon start to ulcer through the skin. 'The other problem is the foreskin is swelling and splitting - the foreskin is 15 times more swollen than should be.' After examining\u00a0Szilveszter Dr Vijh said he had never seen anything like it and the only treatment would be to 'skin' the penis to get rid of the Vaseline and scar tissue . The cosmetic surgeon said the only option would be for\u00a0Szilveszter to have an operation where his penis would be 'skinned' to remove the Vaseline and scar tissue. 'I have never done this before but fingers crossed we can save his penis,' Dr Vijh said. After hours of surgery, the operation was a success. As a result of Dr Vihj removing all the Vaseline and scar tissue, Szilveszter is now back in full health following his recovery from the operation. He said: 'I am much better. It has healed well, it's painfree and working. I can have sex with my wife again. 'Many people said we can't help you. Dr Vijh did a perfect job, he has changed my life.' The father said he had learnt his lesson and won't meddle with his penis size again. Extreme Beauty Disasters is on TLC Thursdays at 8pm .\n"]}
{"question_id": 556, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Dongguan, China (CNN)For a decade, the New South China Mall -- the biggest shopping mall in the world -- has been an embarrassment for its owners and China. Opened to the public in 2005 in Dongguan in the south of the country, the goal was to attract 100,000 visitors a day with an array of entertainment, shops and eateries. Outside the mall, a giant Egyptian sphinx and a replica of the Arc de Triomphe were erected alongside fountains and canals complete with Venetian gondolas. It even boasted an indoor roller coaster. But despite the grand plans neither stores nor shoppers came. Soon, it was classified by industry analysts as a \"dead mall\" and it became an unflattering symbol of China's runaway speculation on real estate projects. The mall spans five million square feet of shopping area, making it the largest in the world in terms of leasable space -- more than twice the size of Mall of America, the biggest shopping center in the United States. When I visited two years ago, the mall was deserted. Most units were empty. Paint was coming off the walls and store signs and advertisements had faded. The air had a dry smell of dust and garbage was piled everywhere. The occupancy rate was less than 10%. It was a walk through a ghost mall. However, a visit in late March revealed a different picture. The mall was buzzing with activity. Large parts of the previously abandoned buildings are now full of shops, restaurants and entertainment venues. Visitors could be seen browsing for luxury sunglasses and designer jeans, dining at the Korean, Italian or Chinese restaurants or enjoying the new entertainment facilities. Screams and laughter can be heard from merry-go-rounds. \"It's been a big change. It's a clear modernization,\" said David Carr, an English teacher from the United States who is living in Dongguan with his wife Danae, also a teacher. \"We come here at least once a month now.\" Despite the signs of life, much of the mall is still vacant. But most of the unoccupied units, along with halls and walkways are under renovation. Even on a Saturday, it's full of construction workers and the constant sound of jack-hammering and sawing. Ms Shu, head of New South China Mall's marketing unit, told CNN that there are plans for a re-launch ceremony this spring, when all construction work will be completed and most shop and restaurant areas are leased to tenants. \"All construction that is currently going on at the mall is preparation for the opening in May,\" she said, declining to give her full name. \"We expect that from May, we will have almost full occupancy rate and no empty shops.\" She said she couldn't offer any more details as she was not authorized to speak with media. Ms Ye, head of investments, confirmed that \"business is really great,\" but would not comment further. Dutch retail chain Spar, which has expanded its supermarket to two floors, explained on its website that it had re-launched last year during the mall's \"upgrading and retrofitting program.\" There are also plenty of recruitment ads posted at the entrance of the mall. When I spoke to her, Huang Haiyan, a young Chinese woman, was just two days away from opening a little caf\u00e9 called \"Miss & H\" in one of the passage ways being renovated. Sitting on the sidewalk outside the caf\u00e9, she and her partners were busy washing up cups, classes and plates ahead of the big day. \"I'm so excited!\" she said, showing the kind of enthusiasm that had been non-existent when I last visited the mall two years ago. \"You must come, my coffee is the best in China!\" The area around the previously run-down Arc de Triomphe is now a tranquil roofed boulevard with small coffee shops where youngsters play cards and mothers sip lattes. In January, a globe shaped IMAX-style cinema was launched at the outdoor square. One of the more eye-catching new sources of entertainment is a role-playing amusement center for children called Myrules World. Today, it no longer feels like a walk through a ghost mall. It's hard to believe how rapid the change has been. Economist Brian Jackson says the shift in focus towards restaurants and businesses that target China's middle, rather than, upper class, is a smart move on behalf of the developers. \"Many large malls (and residential construction) in China.... are all hoping to target one demographic -- the upper class,\" he said. \"What is needed to succeed is retail space that caters to (the much larger) bulk of middle-class Chinese.\" And, he says, other developments that were once labeled \"ghost cities\" have gone on to thrive. \"One to three years is a blink of an eye in terms of city developments, so many of these cities still have time to fill and become functional,\"Jackson said. Despite its retrofitting program, the problems that have dogged the mall since its start will not disappear instantly. Most of Dongguan's almost 10 million inhabitants are migrant workers struggling to make ends meet. The town is also facing difficulties as manufacturing moves elsewhere in China or to Southeast Asia where wages are lower. China is also haunted by serious problems in its real-estate market, with over investment and large vacancy rates. In March, prices of new homes fell for the twelfth consecutive month. What's more, the mall's latest re-launch is not its first. In 2007, the mall changed name from \"South China Mall\" to \"New South China Mall, Living City\" and a revitalization plan was drawn up by current owners the Founders Group, a conglomerate set up by Peking University, and its subsidiary PKU Founder. But the revamp failed and the mall remained empty. Now, the owners are hoping for third time lucky. PICTURES: Inside a Chinese ghost city .\n"]}

The commuter who captured the distracted driving on a bus with only standing room said that the behavior occurred the entire time she was travelling . 'He jeopardized the lives of everyone on that bus and anyone on the street,' the commuter said. The papers in his hand were likely timetables used to make sure he was stopping at all the correct junctures on Saturday evening,  the\u00a0New York Post\u00a0reported, citing a transit source. The bus was being used to replace part of a subway line closed for maintenance during the weekend. New York's Metro Transportation Authority, which runs the city's buses, said that 'bus operators are expected to have their full attention on safe operations at all times'. The driver has been taken out of passenger service while the agency investigates, and could face possible penalties including termination or retraining depending on his work history, according to a New York Post source. New York City adopted new laws last year as part of an effort to eliminate traffic accidents, such as the February 2014 crash between an city bus and a truck that careened into a building on 7th Avenue . This weekend's video comes as New York City has targeted speeding and reckless motorists in a bid to eliminate traffic deaths . A  law pushed into law by Mayor Bill DeBlasio last August has increased penalties on drivers, including MTA employees, who hit pedestrians after failing to yield.

He said the foreign and planning ministries would undertake a joint legal filing in the coming days to try and block further exploration. 'We want the owners of the companies to be tried according to Argentine laws and international statutes,' Mr Filmus said, adding that the process 'could end with an Argentine judge issuing an arrest warrant against those who operate illegally in Argentine waters'. The discovery at the Zebedee exploratory well comes amid worsening relations with Buenos Aires, exactly 33 years after Argentina invaded the islands. Lord West of Spithead, a former First Sea Lord, said last night the find would lead to further claims by the Argentinians over the long-disputed territory in the South Atlantic. 'The rhetoric and sabre-rattling from Argentina will grow,' he added. 'The Argentinians have always been worried we will find oil and, given their economic state, they will think, 'We should have it'. 'We will have to be careful. The only way to stop them (acting) is to ensure we have sufficient military there. The rhetoric from Argentina will get worse.' Argentina invaded the Falklands in 1982, leading to a conflict that cost 260 British and 650 Argentine lives. The South American state still claims territorial rights to the islands. Britain pledged last week to invest \u00a3180million over the next ten years to defend the islands, with an upgrade of a surface-to-air missile system and the deployment of two Chinook helicopters. The commitment came after it was revealed earlier this year that Russia could be helping to re-arm Argentina. The latest incident sees a heightening of tensions between Argentina and Britain over the Falklands. Pictured is the bombing of the Sir Galahad Troop Carrier, after it was hit by a missile . A map shows the oil has been discovered 130 north of the island by British companies at the Zebedee oil well . Yesterday's discovery, which could yield 100 million barrels of oil, was announced by the British firms that share the exploration area, Premier Oil, Rockhopper Exploration and Falkland Oil & Gas. Malcolm Graham-Wood, an oil industry expert and founder of the consultancy HydroCarbon Capital, said: 'This is good for Britain, good for British oil companies, good for taxes and good for the industry.' Samuel Moody, chief executive of Rockhopper, which is named after the southern rockhopper penguins found on the islands, said: 'This is a fantastic start to the 2015 Falklands drilling campaign and provides early proof of the significant remaining potential of the North Falkland Basin.' Shares in the oil-exploration companies initially soared to double digits after the discovery was announced. The row over the sovereignty of the islands, which Argentina calls Malvinas, could be intensified by the oil find. However, Mr Graham-Wood said: 'Oil is always found in difficult places, geographically and politically \u2013 look at Alaska, for instance \u2013 but that has never worried the oil industry.' Oil expert Charlie Sharp, of the investment bank Canaccord Genuity, said the Zebedee discovery was 'an excellent start to the exploration campaign'. War veterans sing the national anthem and hold the Argentinian flag during a ceremony marking the 33rd anniversary of the start of the Falklands War. Argentina has now written to the UN about British 'aggression' Argentina's President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner (right) pays tribute to the soldiers who died in the conflict during  the commemoration of the 33rd anniversary in Ushuaia last week . Kirchner\u00a0used the anniversary - commemorated in Argentina as the Day of the Veterans and Fallen of the Malvinas Islands War - to criticise Britain's announcement it will beef up its defence of the islands . Kirchner told the crowd: 'We will see the islands form part of our territory again. It's not just wishful thinking' Documents released by American whistleblower Edward Snowden allege Britain was actively spying on Argentina between 2006 and 2011. There has been no official response from Britain or Argentina to the claims, which were published by several Argentine news agencies. The documents include allegations Britain implanted computer viruses and circulated false propaganda to discredit the Argentine government, it has been reported. It follows another made nearby in 2012 through a project called Sea Lion, but the price of oil has halved since June, forcing many explorers to cut back on spending. Experts also predict future finds could be even more significant. Stephane Foucaud, oil analyst at First Energy, said the latest discovery is 'encouraging news', but another well \u2013 called Isobel Deep, 15 miles to the south \u2013 is the 'most important' in the area. Mr Fallon said last week that existing defences in the Falklands would be modernised, with investment in 'ageing infrastructure' and an upgrade of the surface-to-air missile system. It came after news that Russian president Vladimir Putin was reportedly working on a deal to lease 12 Sukhoi Su-24 bombers to Argentina. Intelligence chiefs warned that Argentina could land forces on a remote island, and that commanders needed support helicopters to enable infantry to react to any threat.\n"]}

Dr Sandra Lee is dermatologist at the\u00a0Skin Physicians & Surgeons practice in Upland, California, and a regular guest on The Doctors talk show, but online she is known simply as Dr Pimple Popper, a moniker she used when she started posting clips of her patients' extractions on her\u00a0YouTube channel. The clips have earned her nearly 60,000 subscribers, as well as loyal fan base of zit squeezing enthusiasts on Reddit. 'I find this little subculture fascinating,' Dr Lee told Racked\u00a0of her followers. 'I pop these things, and yeah they kind of make me feel good, they\u2019re satisfying, but it\u2019s not like I seek them out.' Scroll down for video . All in a day's work: Dermatologist Dr Sandra Lee, who known as Dr Pimple Popper online, shares videos of herself extracting her patients zits on her popular YouTube channel . Day job: Dr Lee, from Upland, California, can be seen using a\u00a0comedone extractor to pop one of her patient's blemishes . Dr Lee explained that when a patient comes in she offers to tackle their blemishes in exchange for them allowing her to post the videos of the process online, while keeping the clips as anonymous as she can. And she noted that, despite the somewhat gruesome nature of her YouTube channel, 'nobody ever says no'. Before she shot to internet fame, Dr Lee's channel, used to only feature a selection of TV segments that she had done, only had a few thousand followers. However, when she joined\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0she started posting short clips of her actually treating patients, a decision which quickly garnered her much more interest, prompting her to start putting full-length clips up on YouTube, starting with a video of her extracting a man's blackheads. 'I didn\u2019t realize how big it would be,' she said of the video, which has received more than 360,000 views since it was posted in December. Dr Lee explained that she was such an 'amateur' at the time; she barely knew anything about Reddit and was 'floored' when she learned that her video was being shared on a popular pimple popping subreddit. The experience opened her eyes to an entire community that she had no idea existed. The doctor, who is now well-known on the subreddit, said the people are 'really wonderful'. Big break: Dr Lee became an internet sensations after she posted this video of herself extracting a man's blackheads on YouTube. The clips was later shared on Reddit and helped her to earn a loyal fan base . But Dr Lee questions whether she is a 'true popper' because she doesn't actually enjoy watching people squeeze and poke their whiteheads and cysts on their own. 'I don\u2019t watch any of the other videos,' she said. 'They all kind of gross me out! When they\u2019re amateur, I don\u2019t want to hear screaming, I don\u2019t like that stuff.' But pimple popping has quickly become a key part of Dr Lee's occupation. In fact, it's basically the family business; both her father and her husband are dermatologists as well. According to Dr Lee the most popular types of popping are the extractions of blackheads and whiteheads, and she has now come to learn that there are two different varieties of video \u2013 \u2018a soft pop and a hard pop'. 'Some people just like blackheads, it\u2019s like soft porn, a soft pop,' she noted. 'And then there\u2019s a hard pop, where people like more of a cyst.' In March, Dr Lee posted a 'best of soft pop' video montage has been viewed more than 500,000 since it was posted last month. 'I've been listening to you guys, and I hear that there are two general groups of you PimplePoppaholics: Some like the SoftPop, some prefer the HardPop!' she wrote in the description. 'Of course, some of you like it all, but I thought I would try to make as many of you happy as I can. Here's a Soft Pop Best Of... I'll have a HardPop Best Of later today for you. Enjoy! [sic]' Free time: The dermatologist, pictured in a selfie posted on her Instagram account, is now well-known among the pimple popping community on Reddit . Basic extraction: Dr Lee said videos of blackheads and whiteheads being removed (pictured) are most popular . And many commenters lauded Dr Lee for her rapport with her patients. Dr Lee, who uses her iPhone and iMovie to shoot and edit the videos, told Racked that she likes to show the 'human side' of her patients by having them share their back story. She said that her favorite clips are of a patient she calls 'Pop', who recently lost his wife to a 'chronic, painful\u00a0sickness'. 'What's amazing is that what started as a video of my squeezing the blackheads on his nose has transformed into the wonderful feel-good human interest story,' she told Daily Mail Online. She continued: 'They were inseparable, and he has had trouble adjusting to his new life in an assisted living facility. He has both financial and emotional stress, and he tells a little of his story in his videos.' After hearing Pop's struggles, Dr Lee's YouTube and Reddit followers asked her to start him a GoFundMe page so they could help him financially. The page, which was started on April 15, has already already exceeded its $5,000 goal - raising $5,665 in just eight days. Family business: Dr Lee can be seen with her husband\u00a0Dr Jeffrey Rebish, who is also a dermatologist . Addicting videos: Dr Lee can be seen extracting a blackhead from one of her patients . 'He knows a little about what is going on, but doesn't know yet how much people have donated to help him out in his current situation,' she explained. 'He would be shocked to hear that well wishes are coming from all over the world.' One commenter who made a donation noted: 'This gentleman reminds me of my grandpa. I wish him all the best, he is such a gentle soul. Lots of love from a French girl in the UK x [sic].' Dr Lee said she plans on visiting him in his new home and present him with all the cards, messages and money that people have given him next week. 'I can't wait to see how surprised and touched he will be,' she said. As for her extraction technique, Dr Lee told Racked that it's 'not completely sterile', but she uses clean gloves and a comedone extractor, which she said costs less than $20. Although she warned that people shouldn't pop their pimples because they can risk scarring, she admitted that she is guilty of squeezing her own zits at home. For people who absolutely have to pick, Dr Lee advised them to use a warm compress and prick the blemish with a sterile needle when it comes to a head. But she he added that she can't ensure anyone that they aren't going to scar when they take matters into their own hands. Dr Lee, who is also a skin cancer surgeon and a cosmetic surgeon, explained that she has posted videos of her doing other procedures, but people aren't as interested in them. 'People might construe that I\u2019m addicted to this stuff, but I\u2019m not,' she said of work as Dr Pimple Popper. 'This isn\u2019t everything that I do. In fact, it\u2019s a very small part.'\n"]}

Ian Guffick asked pupils to make changes to the the national curriculum tests for 11-year-olds, which assess English, maths and science at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewskesbury, Gloucestershire. This was despite the exam session finishing, a conduct panel heard. Ian Guffick asked pupils at Mitton Manor Primary School in Tewkesbury, pictured, to make the changes to their SATs exam answers . The 31-year-old also altered a number of the pupil's exam answers himself before the papers were sent off. After the suspected breach of exam rules, school officials were tipped off, resulting in an investigation being launched in June. The probe by the local education authority found that some pupils taking a test had changed answers outside exam conditions and that Guffick had done the same. It then led to the Department for Education annulling all SATs exam results for the entire school last year, the hearing was told. Guffick was later forced to give up his job at the school and had since admitted the allegations and accepted it amounted to unacceptable professional conduct. The Department for Education annulled the whole school's SAT's results after a probe by the local education authority (file picture) However, he insisted in a statement that he did not ask the pupils to change their answers, but to make them more legible. But the panel, run by the National College for Teaching and Leadership, said that no changes of any kind should be made to exam scripts outside test conditions. Panel chair Martin Pilkington said, although the teacher\u2019s conduct had been dishonest, it fell short of fraud or serious dishonesty. But he added: 'Whilst the panel accepts that Mr Guffick may have felt under pressure to achieve good results for himself and the school, that can in no way excuse his behaviour. 'It is clear to the panel that he deeply regrets his conduct and the panel also considered that he was forthcoming in explaining what he had done when it was investigated by the school and local authority.' Paul Heathcote, acting on behalf of Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, banned Guffick from the classroom for at least two years. He said: 'His actions had a serious impact on the school as their SATs results were annulled for 2014. 'Mr Guffick\u2019s actions were deliberate and he was not acting under duress. 'In all the circumstances, I agree with the panel\u2019s recommendation that a prohibition order is an appropriate and proportionate sanction.

Builders in Turkey have accidentally found one of the largest and most complex underground cities in the otherworldly region of Cappadocia. \u00a0The city lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress (pictured). Three entrances to the impressive complex can be seen, leading to vast, winding tunnels . The subterranean city dates back around 5,000 years and was discovered when builders saw signs of a massive network of tunnels while moving mounds of Earth. It lies beneath the Nev\u015fehir fortress and the surrounding area, which was being excavated during a construction project carried out by Turkey's Housing Development Administration (TOK\u0130). The multilevel settlement is likely to include living spaces, kitchens, wineries, chapels, staircases, according to a report in National Geographic.

Scientists have yet to discover all its secret passages . Cappadocia, or 'Kapadokya' in Turkish, translates as 'land of the beautiful horses' and tourists often catch a glimpse of long-maned horses galloping through the formations. Millions of years ago, volcanic activity covered the region under several layers of ash. Erosion then created a landscape of rock formations and spires known as 'fairy chimneys.' The volcanic rock, or 'tuff,' was soft and highly malleable, and proved ideal building material. The idea for underground cities came during the Byzantine-era when residents used them as hideouts when threatened by invasion by the Persians, Arabs and Seljuq Turks.

In Los Angeles there was a standing ovation when the original star, Julie Andrews, came on stage. However, one country was left baffled: Austria, where the movie was set and filmed. \u2018We didn\u2019t really know what was going on,\u2019 said one Austrian I know. Each year, 300,000 people come to Salzburg to soak up the magic and visit the locations of the film \u2013 it\u2019s the reason three-quarters of all tourists head to the city. The beautiful flower beds of at Mirabell Gardens in Salzburg that Sound of Music fans will recognise . Julie Andrews from the beloved film The Sound of Music, fans of which continue to flock to Salzburg . The first tours started shortly after the film opened, but now buses emblazoned with The Sound of Music circle the city, day in, day out. And the Austrians still don\u2019t get it. You\u2019ll be looking a long time in the Salzburg tourist shops before you find a Julie Andrews postcard for sale, let alone lederhosen fashioned from curtain fabric. There are some real advantages in this if you\u2019re a fan of The Sound of Music. And I am. It means there\u2019s nothing to stop me from splashing about in fountains while humming that I have confidence or juggling fruit in the markets (perhaps not a good idea). The Old Town, where much of the movie was shot, is too narrow for tour buses, and that fact \u2013 combined with the lack of tourist tat \u2013 means there\u2019s nothing to break the spell as you slide into The Sound of Music mindset. Also happily for fans of the film, Salzburg is a pretty conservative sort of place, and doesn\u2019t rush about embracing change. Half a century after shooting the movie, Julie Andrews could return to the city and wander round without too many shocks to the system (providing she overlooked the McDonald\u2019s on Getreidegasse, sitting uncomfortably amid shops selling Austrian national dress). For me, Salzburg is the most hummable city ever \u2013 although the tunes you find yourself humming are probably not those that would be chosen by the city fathers. Lady Gaga paid tribute to the film, in the presence of its original star, for its 50 anniversary at the Oscars . Built into the mountains, in medieval times the church harnessed much of the local wealth that came from salt mining \u2013 in fact, it still owns a lot of the surrounding land, and built the magnificent monasteries and convents that dominate the city. The real Maria von Trapp \u2013 played by Andrews in the film \u2013 actually did become a novice at Nonnberg, which was founded in the 8th Century. Head past here around 7pm and you\u2019re still likely to hear the real-life nuns singing Gregorian chants. Bells peel at every opportunity and the mountains \u2013 well, it\u2019s safe to say they haven\u2019t changed much. On my first trip, more than 20 years ago, I stayed at an independent hostel, the Yoho (www.yoho.at) in Paracelsusstrasse, which I\u2019m pleased to say is still going strong and still showing The Sound Of Music for free each night. Then it was a solitary outpost of Rodgers and Hammerstein-based enthusiasm, but now there are encouraging signs that the rest of Austria may just be starting to catch on. Sound of Music tourism began almost immediately after the film's release and is still going strong . My hotel for this trip, the rather more luxurious Castellani Parkhotel, shows the film on a continual loop on one of its TV channels. I could wake up to Climb Ev\u2019ry Mountain and nod off to Sixteen Going On Seventeen. And I did. It was an ideal base for a Sound of Music weekend. The hotel even has its own wedding chapel \u2013 a gorgeous baroque concoction created during its days as an aristocratic mansion. It has to be said that breakfast doesn\u2019t really feature in the film, which is the perfect excuse to start the day with apple strudel. And the best place to do so? Cafe Tomaselli, Salzburg\u2019s oldest, dating from the 18th Century, right in the centre of the city in Alter Markt. The coffee is strong, served in multiple ways, while its strudel has spiced apple and crisp pastry, and is drenched in enough sugar to start an avalanche. Then it\u2019s time to tick off a few of the key sights. First up, the Residenzplatz, just outside the cafe. In the movie it\u2019s draped with Nazi flags. Cafe Tomaselli , Salzburg\u2019s oldest, dates back to the 18th Century and is in the centre of the city in Alter Markt . Rumour has it that as the Second World War had ended just 20 years earlier, the city authorities weren\u2019t keen on the flags, but the producers won them round by saying that the alternative was to use original footage of the German annexation of Austria in the film. Then there\u2019s St Peter\u2019s Cemetery \u2013 a series of catacombs that the movie\u2019s set designers used as inspiration for the flight scenes \u2013 and the Felsenreitschule, the open-air theatre that was used for the concert scenes. Now it shows operas and concerts. As for the Salzach, the river that the city straddles, you cross it via the Mozart bridge, used by Maria and the children as they sang Do-Re-Mi. The Mirabell Gardens on the other side of the river allow an even fuller expression of appreciation for the film. Pat the head of the stone dwarf; jump up and down the steps; run about a lot! Many people do it and \u2013 even more hearteningly \u2013 post the results on YouTube. And all the time, Austrians are just enjoying walking in the gardens, completely oblivious, next to a palace built by an archbishop for his 15 children (particularly noteworthy in a Catholic country). Residenzplatz, just outside Cafe Tomaselli, was draped in Nazi flags in the 50-year-old film . But to really immerse yourself in the full experience, and to see the more outlying locations, you have to take a tour. I\u2019ve taken a few in my time \u2013 I tend to feel them calling me each time I head to Salzburg, just as Maria felt the mountains calling her. Over the years I\u2019ve been accompanied on them by groups ranging from unthrilled Austrians to up-for-it Australians in dirndls who had us singing the different parts of The Lonely Goatherd as we headed into the mountains. This time, however, I was accompanied by Gerry, an Austrian who\u2019d actually seen the film, as well as Brits (loads), Americans, and a family from Malaysia. We headed to Hellbrunn, where the gazebo from Sixteen Going On Seventeen is now housed (and now locked after too many fans tried to leap from bench to bench and injured themselves). We also passed the house that served as the main location for the von Trapp family home. It\u2019s now part of the Mozarteum Music Academy, and the easiest way to stay there is to become a top-flight musician. Sarah Turner found herself singing along to The Lonely Goatherd with up-for-it Australians in dirndls . We then started climbing our way into the mountains that feature in the opening shots \u2013 now augmented with nice chalets, as this area is a popular escape for posh Austrians and Germans \u2013 and gazed down at the town of Fuschl and its lake, one of Austria\u2019s most famous views. British Airways\u00a0offers return flights from Gatwick to Salzburg from \u00a3102. Rooms at the Castellani Parkhotel Salzburg\u00a0start at \u00a395. Tours with Panorama start at \u00a329 per person. Finally, we arrived at Mondsee. This lakeside town provided the church used for the wedding. About 70 per cent of the people on the trip (there is an over-representation of women) took the chance to walk down the aisle. Needless to say, I was among them. I emerged, blinking, into the sunlight to enjoy cake shops and, amazingly, a shop selling film memorabilia. I felt thrilled. It seemed the whole world was now united in its love for this movie \u2013 even Austrians themselves. What\u2019s more, the state theatre in Salzburg \u2013 the Landestheater \u2013 now even has a production of The Sound Of Music. It\u2019s only taken 50 years. There\u2019s just one thing to remember. Edelweiss is not the Austrian national anthem, whatever Ronald Reagan thought. He once arranged to have it played when the Austrian ambassador arrived at the White House.\n"]}

Half of voters agree with Ukip that immigrants should not immediately receive free HIV treatment, a poll suggests. Nigel Farage caused controversy at the televised leaders\u2019 debate last week by attacking the high cost of giving anti-retroviral drugs to sufferers not born in Britain. Ed Miliband said his comments were \u2018disgusting\u2019, Nick Clegg said they were \u2018politics of the lowest form\u2019 and chancellor George Osborne, when asked, said he was \u2018not going to dignify that with a response.\u2019 The Ukip leader insisted afterwards that he had the \u2018overwhelming support\u2019 of the British public for saying that foreign nationals with HIV \u2013 whom he said accounted for 60 per cent of the 7,000 cases a year \u2013 \u2018can come into Britain from anywhere in the world and get diagnosed with HIV and get the retroviral drugs that cost up to \u00a325,000 per patient\u2019. He added: \u2018I know there are some horrible things happening in many parts of the world, but what we need to do is put the National Health Service there for British people and families who in many cases have paid into the system for decades.\u2019 A YouGov poll of 1,906 adults found that 50 per cent would support \u2018people coming to live in the UK being banned from receiving treatment on the NHS for a period of five years\u2019.\u00a0Another 34 per cent opposed such a ban. A second question saw voters asked which statement best reflected their view. In this, 52 per cent thought Mr Farage was \u2018right to raise this issue - immigrants with serious conditions like HIV are costing the health service a large amount of money\u2019. This compared with 37 per cent who picked: \u2018Nigel Farage was just scaremongering - compared to the total cost of the NHS this is a drop in the ocean\u2019, and 11 per cent did not know. Interestingly, the respondents did not appear to particularly favour Ukip, saying on average that Mr Farage was only the fourth best-performing leader last Thursday, with Nicola Sturgeon in the lead, followed by David Cameron and Ed Miliband. It later emerged that Mr Farage\u2019s figures were a bit out \u2013 there are 6,000 diagnoses of HIV every year according to Public Health England. Diane James, an MEP and the party\u2019s justice and home affairs spokesman, insisted yesterday that Ukip would go on if Farage lost . Just over half (54 per cent) are foreign born, but most of them are thought to have been infected whilst living in the UK. The cost of anti-retroviral drugs per year gas been put at up to \u00a316,000 depending on the stage of infection. The Ukip leader, speaking on the campaign trail yesterday defended his remarks saying he wanted people to \u2018think and understand why their grandmother who is 85 finds it very difficult to get drugs for breast cancer but anybody can get on a plane from anywhere in the world, be HIV tested in London and receive antiretroviral drugs. Something, it seems to me, isn\u2019t right here.\u2019 Any foreign national - even a failed asylum seeker \u2013 who is diagnosed, has been entitled to free treatment since 2012 due to what experts say are the risks of allowing the virus to spread. A Ukip spokesman said: \u2018This poll finding shows yet again the disconnect that exists between the Westminster bubble and much of the population. 'Nigel Farage is the one leader who has the political courage to raise difficult issues and clearly millions of voters agree with that stance.\u2019 It later emerged that Mr Farage\u2019s figures were a bit out \u2013 there are 6,000 diagnoses of HIV every year according to Public Health England . Mr Farage took a blow yesterday as another poll showed he would fail to secure a Parliamentary seat. He has vowed to stand down as leader if he fails to become the MP for Thanet South, which he is fighting hard to win at the General Election. A private ComRes poll paid for by a Ukip donor put the Conservatives on course to retain the seat by a small margin.

Hernandez hasn't set foot in the stadium since June 2013, when he was arrested under suspicion of murdering Odin Lloyd, who was dating the sister of Hernandez's fiance\u00e9 at the time. On Wednesday, a 12-person jury found Hernandez guilty, sentencing him to life in prison without the possibility of parole due to some especially heinous aspects of Lloyd's killing.

Nothing to smile about now: Hernandez slumped down in his chair on Wednesday as a guilty verdict was read (left). Pictured on the right during happier times, playing for the Patriots . Hernandez was shocked by the decision, mouthing 'You're wrong', before slumping to his seat - perhaps seeing the riches to rags reality of his new life. Hernandez has vowed to appeal the decision. Directly after court, Hernandez was taken to the 700-inmate facility that will serve as a stark contrast to his former home - a $1.3million mansion. Hernandez arrived at Cedar Junction around 1pm for booking and was given the prison number W106228. The booking process took about two hours, and was probably not the most comfortable of experiences. According to a report by WBUR, new inmates at the facility are taken downstairs into the basement where the intake center is located. It is there that they change into their new uniform of gray scrubs and laceless canvas shoes, turning over their personal clothes to be either incinerated or mailed home.

Sheriff Hogson spoke with WHDH after the ruling on Wednesday and said that as the focus of a high-profile case, Hernandez will be targeted in the prison. 'It depends how he's classified or where he'll be, but it's always a possibility, always a concern,' Hodgson said.

The food at Cedar Junction was described by a Boston Globe reporter as 'marginally edible'. Hernandez pictured above eating chicken after a Patriots game . Some other aspects of prison life may not be up to Hernandez's standards either - such as the 50 cents an hour inmates are paid to manufacture license plates. In 2012, the Patriots extended Hernandez's contract for five years in a $40million deal that was unprecedented for a tight end. Also in 2012, he signed a deal to be a spokesman for shoe brand Puma.

And the art book, which was published in August last year, has achieved unheard levels of success, selling 500,000 copies worldwide and been translated into 19 different languages. The success of Animal Kingdom's has come as a huge surprise, not least to Millie herself. 'My illustrations are a real labour of love, they take a long time and I think people really can and do appreciate that,' said the former art teacher. 'Because of the intricate style of my drawings people find them quite interesting and perhaps a little more captivating than your traditional colouring book.

In 2013, she was approached by Batsford Ltd, her now-publisher, to see if she would be interested in doing the book. She took eight months to complete the illustrations in their entirety and thinks their popularity is down to nostalgia. She explained: 'I would say there is definitely a universal appeal to colouring in. 'It's something that probably all of us enjoyed as children and is a wonderfully simple creative outlet and a great way for us to de-stress in today's busy and fast paced world.

And reviewers have taken to the UK Amazon site to rave about their own experiences of the therapeutic benefits. One user commented: 'Received this book yesterday and haven't stopped since. 'I've always loved colouring but got recommended this to help overcome tension headaches caused from work. The pics are amazing an the paper quality is good. I have already completed four pics in one day!' 'Colouring can offer a much needed distraction from the 'grown up' world': The 36-year-old illustrator (pictured) took eight months to complete the book and has explained that she finds drawing therapeutic . The book, Animal Kingdom, retails at \u00a33.99 and is currently at the top of Amazon's Top 100 Books list . The Welsh illustrator has said that, although it is mostly adults buying the book, the influence of Animal Kingdom is widespread. She has received emails from people of all backgrounds saying how much they enjoyed the simple act of colouring in her line drawings. 'From parents who have bought it for themselves to colour while their young children are doing their own colouring, to students who use it as stress relief in between study and revision,' said Millie. Many fans are  busy professionals who need a break from looking at a screen all day long but adults and children alike are buying the book as a stylish gift for friends and family. Millie says that Animal Kingdom is becoming the present of choice for people recuperating from illness, while there are, 'Ladies in their 80s who love it so much they have started their own colouring club!' Millie agrees that the rise in popularity of adult colouring books, could be down to their therapeutic quality. She explained: 'I think the level of detail in my illustrations requires people to really focus on what they are doing when colouring them. 'In that sense I think people have found them quite therapeutic and an effective way to 'switch off' as they become really absorbed in what they're doing.' The artist has also insisted that the popularity of the book could be down to the more artistic quality of the images. This image of striking stag was created by the Welsh designer out of detailed fauna line drawings . Plenty more fish in the sea! Millie's page of exotic fish has been shaded on in different colour variations . She said: 'I also think that because the illustrations do take some time to complete there is a real sense of achievement and satisfaction at the end of it. 'Someone said to me that with Animal Kingdom they feel like they are colouring little pieces of artwork rather than pages in a colouring book. 'I think people enjoy feeling that at the end of it they will have a book of their own artworks which will hopefully be something they will keep and cherish.'\n"]}

Insisting the officials should not escape scot free either, however, Sutton says Muir should be kept away from high-profile games if he's not up to the job. 'There's not a conspiracy theory or anything like that,' he insisted. 'It was just an absolute shocker. I just can't work out what he was thinking. 'It was just idiotic how he didn't see it. It wasn't a conspiracy, I just can't remember a decision that bad from someone standing so close. 'There is no way he could have thought that ball hit the player on the head, he must be an idiot not to see it. It's just ridiculous.' A goal ahead at the time, Celtic reacted to 'supporter pressure' by writing to the SFA seeking clarification on the failure of referee Steven McLean to award a penalty and send Meekings off. Sutton infamously triggered a huge row in 2003 when he accused Dunfermline of 'lying down' to Rangers to pip Celtic to the title on the final day. Insisting Sunday was a question of incompetence rather than integrity, however, he added: 'It's not a conspiracy, it's just a rubbish and inept decision. 'It shouldn't happen and it doesn't reflect well on the Scottish game if decisions like that are made. 'I don't know if maybe he (Muir) panicked, but he has a job to do and if he is not up to the job \u2014 which he clearly wasn't \u2014 then he shouldn't do it again.

Former teachers of Al-Taqwa College, in Melbourne's outer western suburbs,  claim in a letter sent to the state and federal education ministers that principal Omar Hallak was discriminating against female students. The Age reported that the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority is currently investigating the allegations. Omar Hallak, principal of Islamic School Al-Taqwa College in Melbourne, reportedly bans his female students from running . This comes a month after revelations that Mr Hallak was telling students at his school that Islamic State was not 'created' by Muslims, but was instead a plot against them by the West. The letter sent to ministers by a former teacher this week about the girls not being able to fully participate in sport claimed Mr Hallak believes there is 'scientific evidence' to back his claims. 'The principal holds beliefs that if females run excessively, they may 'lose their virginity',' the letter said. 'The principal believes that there is scientific evidence to indicate that if girls injure themselves, such as break their leg while playing soccer, it could render them infertile.' The principal of\u00a0Al-Taqwa College banned female primary school students from participating in the 2013 and 2014 cross country district events, the teacher also claimed. A group of students wrote this letter to Mr Hallak when they discovered they had been banned from competing, and asked him to be 'fair' They said the principal had been unaware that the female students were training for the event, and got involved when he was notified. When they found out they had been prevented from competing, a group of female students penned a letter to their principal asking him to let them compete. 'This letter is about the cross country event that has been cancelled', the letter from 'cross country girls' read. 'Apparantly (sic) it is because girls can't run and that is really offensive to all the girls that were going to participate in the event. 'As a school principal you should treat all the subjects equally just to be fair to all the students that want to participate in a sport event', the letter continued. Last month it was reported that Mr Hallak was teaching students at his school (pictured) that Islamic State was not the doing of Muslims, but rather a plot against them . The note from the group of students also raises that point that 'it doesn't say girls can't run in the hadith (sayings of the prophet Mohammed)' and they should be able to participate as long as they are wearing 'appropriate clothes'. Education minister James Merlino has told 3AW the reports are concerning and the Victorian Registration and Qualifications Authority is investigating. \"If true these are very concerning reports and I have asked the VRQA to investigate and report back to me,\" Mr Merlino has told 3AW on Thursday. When contacted by Daily Mail Australia Al-Taqwa College refused to comment. Last month it was reported that Mr Hallak was teaching students at his school that Islamic State was not the doing of Muslims, but rather a plot against them. He reportedly shows his almost 2,000 students \u2018evidence\u2019 that Islamic State terrorists are \u2018not linked to Islam\u2019. \u2018We don\u2019t believe Muslims are creating IS,\u2019 Mr Hallak told The Age. He believes that the murder and brutality carried out by Islamic State terrorists is actually a plot by Western countries to control oil in the Middle East.\n"]}

A 33-year-old woman who took abortion drugs she bought on the internet to cause a miscarriage and disposed of her fetus in a dumpster has been jailed for 20 years. Purvi Patel, 33, of Granger, Indiana has been jailed after she was convicted on charges of feticide and neglect of a dependent. St Joseph Superior Court heard that Ms Patel attended St Joseph's Hospital in Mishawaka, Indiana on July 13, 2013 soon after giving birth. After arriving at the hospital, she denied that she had even been pregnant, even though medical staff found an umbilical cord attached to her. According to court documents: 'Concerned for the child's welfare, doctors continued to question Purvi Patel of the whereabouts of the child. Eventually, she told the medical staff that she had delivered a baby in her home in Granger, Indiana. 'She further told the medical staff that she did not see the child breathing or moving and believed it to be dead. 'Purvi Patel told the medical staff that she put the dead body in a bag and placed it in a dumpster behind the Super Target. She further told medical personnel that she was roughly two months along and had a miscarriage.' The court heard that Dr Kelly McGuire drove to the Super Target store and began searching the dumpsters, having informed St. Joseph County Police. Officers recovered the body in a dumpster behind Moe's Southwest Grill. According to Forensic Pathologist Dr Joseph Prahlow, the body was 12.2 inches long and weighed 1.46 pounds. His report claimed 'the child had been born alive and had taken a breath'. Court records showed that police examined Ms Patel's mobile phone and was able to extract some evidence. According to Detective Galen Pelletier of County Metro Homicide Unit: 'In her text messages, officers found that on June 19, 2013, Purvi Patel admitted to this friend that she was over 60 days pregnant. She also admitted that she had obtained two drugs from Hong Kong, in an attempt to abort the child. 'Purvi Patel told his friend that she began taking the drugs on July 10, 2013.' St Joseph Superior Court heard that Ms Patel, pictured, purchased abortion drugs from Hong Kong online . Ms Patel, pictured, told medics that she gave birth to a stillborn and disposed of the body in a dumpster . Ms Patel's lawyer Jeff Sanford said his client was planning to appeal the case within 30 days . Medics claimed the first drug would induce labor while the second was designed to end the life of the fetus, however, only if it was less than nine weeks old. Justice Elizabeth Hurley gave Ms Patel a 30-year jail term for neglect, suspending the final ten. She also handed down a six-year term on the feticide charge which will run concurrently. Handing down the sentence, Judge Hurley said: 'You Ms. Patel, are an educated woman of considerable means. If you wished to terminate your pregnancy safely and legally, you could have done so. You planned a course of action and took matters into your own hands.' According to the South Bend Tribune, prosecutors had urged Judge Hurley to hand down a 40-year jail term. Judge Hurley said she considered Ms Patel's lack of prior criminal history and remorse, but condemned her for treating the baby 'literally as a piece of trash'. Chief Deputy Prosecutor Mark Roule said Ms Patel could have sought help for the infant. 'His only chance at survival was his mother. In this case, the mother did nothing, left him on the floor to die and threw him in the trash.' Her lawyer Jeff Sanford said Ms Patel was planning to appeal the case.\n"]}

The TV personality was due to record the show, which he has hosted in the past, on April 23 to be broadcast the following day. The recording would have marked his first appearance for the BBC since being dismissed for hitting Top Gear producer Oisin Tymon in a 'fracas' at a hotel over dinner. Scroll down for video . Jeremy Clarkson will not be hosting an episode of Have I Got News For You later this month, according to the show's producers, though they expect him to return to the show later in the year . Jimmy Mulville, managing director of Hat Trick Productions, said: 'On reflection, Jeremy Clarkson has decided not to host Have I Got News For You. 'We fully expect him to resume his hosting duties later in the year.' Clarkson had been a regular feature on BBC television since taking over Top Gear in 1988 from previous producer Noel Edmonds. He is credited with taking the show from being a niche motoring programme to the most watched series on BBC 2. The hosting slot would have marked Clarkson's first appearance on the BBC since he was dismissed from Top Gear for hitting producer Oisin Tymon . His brash presenting style and refusal to bow to PC culture earned him legions of admirers and critics, and controversy dogged his career. He was put on a 'final warning' after allegedly saying a racial slur on air while reciting a nursery rhyme, and drew more unwanted attention after the Top Gear team were kicked out of Argentina last year while filming a Christmas special. Clarkson's car had a numberplate which was thought to be a deliberate reference the Falklands war, though the BBC denied this. He was suspended by the broadcaster on March 10 when reported himself to the corporation following a row in which producer Oisin Tymon was punched, splitting his lip. Following a week-long investigation, director-general Tony Hall decided against renewing his contract saying at the time 'a line has been crossed'. Despite Clarkson's unruly behaviour, he received an outpouring of public support, including from his friend and Prime Minister, David Cameron, while a million people signed a petition asking for him to be reinstated. Despite Top Gear being taken off the air, Clarkson has not been banned from appearing on the BBC altogether, and so speculation fell on his Have I Got News For You appearance. The car enthusiast also has a controversial history on that programme, once throwing a pen at team captain and Private Eye editor Ian Hislop, cutting his cheek. Clarkson has vowed to keep working after being dismissed from the BBC, and will appear on stage for a series of live motoring shows with former colleagues Richard Hammond and James May. It emerged last week that he will appear on stage with his former Top Gear colleagues, Richard Hammond and James May, later this year to fulfil a series of shows planned before he left the BBC. Clarkson turned himself in to BBC bosses following the dust-up, and after an investigation director-general Tony Hall decided against renewing his contract . However, Clarkson is not banned from appearing on the BBC altogether, meaning he could have fulfilled his commitment to host the satirical news show, but has since withdrawn . The gigs will be stripped of all BBC branding and content, and billed as Clarkson, Hammond and May Live. That means the shows, which will take in venues in Australia, Norway, South Africa and the UK, will not be able to use clips from the show or feature The Stig. The move has sparked rumours that the three men intend to team up to continue their careers together after Clarkson's exit from the corporation, but sources close to the tour say it is just a matter of fulfilling commitments to the fans. The future of the show's other two presenters - Hammond and May - is unclear, with both men's Top Gear contracts also having run out. Since Clarkson's future was decided, May has been seen meeting with BBC head of content Alan Yentob, though the details of what were discussed have not been revealed.\n"]}

Deputy Interior Minister Mahmud Aleuy said about 1,500 people were evacuated, and security measures will continue as \"contingency plans are operating,\" CNN Chile reported Thursday. For the past several days, the geology agency has maintained there was a possibility of a third eruption as part of steadily declining seismic activity in the area. A 20-kilometer (12-mile) exclusion zone has been established around the crater, and Chilean authorities have been keeping residents away from that zone. Last week, military and police forces helped evacuate more than 4,400 residents, the Interior Ministry said then. The seismic event is sure to add to the volume of ash already spewed since the first eruption. Ash spread to Argentina in the second eruption, which occurred a day after the first. Evacuations in the region involved not only people but also animals. The volcanic debris has landed and piled up in some places to a depth of almost 2 feet, the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety said. New advisories say airborne ash could reach an altitude of 12,000 feet. There was no immediate information on the strength of the third eruption, but government officials have said the second, spectacular nighttime eruption was stronger than the first one. Last week in Ensenada, houses, trees and even sheep were blanketed gray with ash. People were removing salmon -- a staple of the local economy -- because of fears of contamination from ash and lava. Trucks were used to evacuate farm animals and pets. Authorities last week issued a red alert for the popular tourist towns of Puerto Montt and Puerto Varas in southern Chile. Last week, people were being evacuated to Puerto Montt on 22 buses and military trucks, the Interior Ministry said. Officials said that volcanic flows from Calbuco caused rising water levels in the R\u00edo Blanco. The first eruption set off a bit of a panic in the region. \"At the beginning, it was small, and later, the cloud grew. And later, there was a huge cloud over you and true terror starts,\" a Puerto Montt resident said. Another person said: \"It was impressive to see an enormous mushroom cloud, with the immense force of the volcano, and to see the ashes. At that point, there was a lot of panic, lots of chaos, traffic jams, people going to supermarkets, everyone looking for water, trying to take out money from the ATMs.\" Magma expanse under Yellowstone supervolcano more vast than thought . The eruption is a first for many in the region. The last major eruption was in 1962. There was a minor eruption in 1972. Calbuco also belched out a bit of gas and smoke in 1996.

Michael Brelo goes on trial on Monday charged with\u00a0two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Timothy Russell, 43, and Malissa Williams, 30. He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. A rookie cop told the same investigators Michael Brelo spoke with that the 31-year-old Cleveland officer talked about it in the days after the November 2012 shooting. Brelo's footprints were also found on the hood of the beat-up Chevy Malibu where  Russell, 43, and Williams, 30, died. Scroll down for video . Cleveland officer Michael Brelo is facing charges after two unarmed suspects were killed in this  Chevy Malibu . Brelo faces two voluntary manslaughter charges after firing the final 15 rounds of the deadky 137-shot barrage . Malissa Williams (left) and Timothy Russell (right) were both unarmed when they were killed in November 2012 . The car was strafed by police gunfire and its two unarmed occupants were killed after a high-speed chase over streets and freeways in and around Cleveland. When Brelo was questioned by investigators two weeks after the shooting, he told them he didn't recall what happened. He said: 'It's possible because I was so terrified that I was going to get run over.' 'But I don't recall that, sir.' Rookie officer Brian Sabolik \u00a0who was assigned to the same district as Brelo, told investigators he stopped firing after 'someone' jumped on the hood of the Malibu. Officer Sabolik said he later learned it was Brelo. Asked how he found out, Sabolik said: 'Because [Brelo] was talking about it.' While Brelo claimed not to remember jumping on the hood, prosecutors have evidence to show that he did. Investigators from the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation found footprints on the hood of the Malibu that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar. Brelo is currently suspended. Photos released by the Office of the Ohio Attorney General show a Cleveland cruiser sitting next to the Chevy . Brelo goes on trial Monday on two counts of voluntary manslaughter for the deaths of Russell and Williams. He is the lone officer among the 13 who fired their weapons that night who is charged criminally because prosecutors say he stood on the hood and opened fire four seconds after the other officers had stopped shooting. A judge - not a jury - will decide whether Brelo is guilty or innocent. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years if convicted. Brelo's defense team has argued that all 49 rounds Brelo fired that night, including the last 15, were lawful. The threat from the pair didn't end until Brelo reached into the Malibu and removed the keys to prevent the suspects from using the car as a weapon, according to his defense. Russell and Williams were each shot more than 20 times. The chase started with a failed traffic stop on the edge of downtown by a plainclothes detective who never reported to dispatchers that he'd lost sight of the vehicle. Russell then sped past Cleveland police headquarters, where his car backfired. Officers and witnesses standing outside were certain they'd heard gunshots and a police radio call for shots fired triggered an adrenaline-fueled rush by officers to join the chase. Brelo and his partner were two of the first officers to join the pursuit that ultimately included more than 60 police cars, 104 officers and reached at least 100mph. In this forensics picture, bullet trajectories from the deadly shooting are marked off on the Chevy Malibu . After driving into a school parking lot more than 20 minutes after the chase began, Russell turned the car around and tried to flee again - sideswiping a cruiser before coming to a stop. Another officer, who said he feared for his life, opened fire, prompting others including Brelo to do the same. Brelo and his partner fired 15 rounds through their own windshield and told investigators they saw dark objects in Russell's and Williams' hands. Brelo said he left his cruiser because he said he was afraid the Malibu would hit him, even though he then crossed in front of the car to climb on top of another cruiser and open fire again. He told investigators:\u00a0'I had leapt trying to get out of the way of this car so it doesn't run me over and kill me.' Investigators found footprints on the hood of the Malibu (left) that matched a set found on the trunk and roof of a police car (right) that Brelo had climbed on top of to fire from behind the light bar . Investigators eventually concluded that neither Russell nor Williams had a gun. An exhaustive search was conducted along the route of the pursuit, including the use of a dive team to look in bodies of water, but no gun was ever found. Regardless of the trial's outcome, the after-effects of the chase and shooting will likely endure for years to come. The incident helped spur a US Justice Department probe that concluded Cleveland police officers have shown a pattern and practice of using excessive force. The city and federal authorities are negotiating a consent decree to reform the police department that will cost the city millions of dollars to implement and enforce. Cleveland has already paid $3million to the families of Russell and Williams to settle a lawsuit.\n"]}

Tyler was, of course, one half of the commentary team that was once seen as being the best of the bunch. That other half back then being his old partner Andy Gray. Nowadays, the man in the gantry alongside him is Gary Neville. And it was his zinger after United's fourth goal \u2013\u00a0'Smalling has scored. It's a mauling for City' \u2013\u00a0that got the veteran lip mic man reaching for the platitudes. And perhaps cementing the new best partnership in the process? I'm not sure if Neville actually carries his recently won Royal Television Society Pundit of the Year award around with him? He could probably just about squeeze the perspex trophy into his inside jacket pocket if he really fancied it, but I doubt he would because I think one thing you could never accuse Neville of being is one of the extroverts among the current batch of experts. Gary Neville  in the Sky Sports studio after co-commentating with Martin Tyler for the Manchester derby . Chris Smalling is pictured scoring for Manchester United as City goalkeeper Joe Hart sees it go in . United defender Smalling was an unlikely goalscorer against City and Neville had a zinger to match it . Co-commentator Neville analysed the goal by saying: 'Smalling has scored. It's a mauling for City' Nevertheless, on his return to his old stamping ground with that new title attached, it was good to see him to turn it on even just a bit. And put in a performance that fitted both his newly anointed status and the magnitude of the occasion. Neville was all over this thrilling derby right from the get go. 'We've got a proper game of football here,' he extolled early on, almost licking his lips at the prospect. He was also quick to point out what he saw as the 'graveyard' of City's right-hand side as United punished them time and time again along the hosts' attacking left. The razor-edged corner of tongue was saved not exclusively, but certainly frequently for Yaya Toure's performance. Time and time again Gary found himself talking about the various patches of grass in which he felt Yaya should be but very rarely was. And when co-commentator Tyler did observe that he could see Toure finally picking up his man, Neville snorted his retort. 'That's nice of him.' He was in equally abrupt mood after the game when he joined Niall Quinn and Graeme Souness for what was a really sharp, incisive and no-holds-barred post-match discussion. Time and time again Neville found himself analysing Yaya Toure's poor performance for City . Toure could do little for City as they suffered a 4-2 defeat by their great rivals United at Old Trafford . Neville (right)and\u00a0Sportsmail's Jamie Carragher form a dynamic Monday Night Football duo . Here Toure carried on getting it from Gary - who referred to the 'dereliction of duty' in his performance before adding that Yaya's recent form was: 'Not a conundrum anymore. He cannot do his job. Simple as that.' What's more, he was equally gobsmacked by Yaya's team-mates' lack of urgency when Aguero scored a late second. 'I can't quite work out whether to get a little bit wound up by this? I'm looking at their reaction. Is that right?' he asked. However, let's not assume this criticism is all because Gary is simply red. On discussing City's immediate Financial Fair Play-affected future, he made it quite clear where he stands. 'I'm a Manchester United fan,' he pointed out, pointlessly. 'But the last thing I want to see is Manchester City dip back down again to the second or third division because they can't challenge because there's some restrictive rule in place. 'We don't want a Real Madrid-Barcelona. We want competition.' Neville was damning in his analysis of City and freely admits he is a United fan after his years of service . Neville was gobsmacked by the City players' lack of urgency when Sergio Aguero (above) scored a second . This turned out to be not only the right moment, but also the right kind of game to make that point. Early in the coverage, host Ed Chamberlain told us 'the eyes of the football world' were watching. Over shots of a touchline teeming with camera crews, he went on to inform us there were '22 broadcasters here' and that the game was 'being beamed to over 100.' Sky Sports then went on to present those broadcasters with exemplary game coverage coupled with some lovely vignettes of the occasion. As well as a close up of the deep set, brooding eyes of Manuel Pellegrini that may haunt me for a fortnight. All in all, it was great coverage of a great game in a genuinely great league. As confirmed by a ton of countries, and Manchester's own Gary Neville.\n"]}

If you live in the UK, there's a small chance that note has found its way into the hands of 23-year-old Daisy Bentley. For the past six years, the London-based artist has scoured the streets of cities and towns looking for those odd bits of paper that flutter to the ground when their owners aren't looking. Her quest has uncovered a fascinating, if idiosyncratic, collection of shopping lists, reminders, requests, love notes and motivational musings, all poignant pieces of others' lives. And now a gallery in London has put a selection on display for the public. \"I wasn't intending to start a collection,\" she told CNN. \"I always naturally collected things -- as many artists do -- and it got to the point that I was picking up every one I saw. Now I can barely walk down a street without picking up a scrap of paper.\" Bentley began collecting them six years ago after a note caught her eye one rainy night on a walk in her home town of Norwich, England. It's something she confesses has been a lifelong love -- keepsakes ranging from her mother's cutlery to her own dead goldfish have ended up carefully preserved in her collection for posterity. The notes project, she says, is a culmination of keeping her eyes on the sidewalk and spotting the little things that most people wouldn't notice as they walked down the street. \"I get very odd looks from strangers,\" she admits, \"but since I've made friends and families aware of the project, they get very excited when I find one while out with them.\" And while some dismiss such behavior as hoarding, Bentley feels it is part of human nature to hold on to items, no matter how small or insignificant they may seem. \"Humans want to collect and show to others,\" she says. \"They want to share and learn from the things they have found.\" She says her collecting has led to interesting anthropological insights into the human condition. One of her favorite observations is the evolution of handwriting over the past few decades, from the beautiful copperplate penmanship of the '70s to modern teen girl love notes with hearts dotting i's and multiple exclamation marks. More recently, the note collection has led to an exhibition at Stour Space gallery in London's Hackney Wick, where Bentley works as a shop and studio manager. It showcases a small part of her 1,500-strong collection. The decision to display the notes came in part from a desire to put them back into the public space. \"I always wanted to showcase them, to see what people's reactions were and if anyone would come forward,\" she said. So far two note owners -- one a colleague from the gallery and one an employee from a pub whose beer coasters she had found on her quest -- have revealed themselves as owners of notes. Bentley gave them framed prints as a thank you. And while some may find the notion of handwritten notes quaint, as social media and smartphones begin to replace handwriting, Bentley says she finds the note collection an interesting way for an artist to explore people's lives. \"Technology is useful, but sometimes the simplest ways are still the best,\" she said. \"I still usually draw a map rather than relying on technology to get to a place -- and many people are just the same.\"\n"]}

None of the girls rescued from raided Boko Haram camps in Nigeria has been identified thus far as among the missing Chibok girls, a high-ranking Nigerian army official said. The official did not rule out that captives from other Boko Haram camps that were raided might be girls abducted in April 2014 from a school in Chibok. The official said he would have the final word by day's end on Wednesday. [Previous story, posted at 4:52 p.m. ET] . Nigerian troops rescued 200 girls and 93 women Tuesday in the Sambisa Forest, the Nigerian Armed Forces announced on its official Twitter account. The armed forces could not immediately confirm if any of the rescued girls were among the 200 schoolgirls the militant group Boko Haram kidnapped in April 2014 from the village of Chibok. Military spokesman Maj. Gen. Chris Olukolade said the rescued girls and women are still being screened and none has spoken to their families yet. The 2014 mass abduction from Chibok led to an international social media movement, #BringBackOurGirls, to rescue them. Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group, has been kidnapping females for years and has hundreds in their custody. Nigerian troops also captured and destroyed three terrorist camps in the Sambisa Forest, the armed forces said. Chibok and the Sambisa Forest are both in the northeastern part of the country. Olukolade said troops are still combing the forest. In recent weeks, Nigerian troops and vigilantes moved into the Sambisa Forest, a known hideout for Boko Haram. Last Wednesday the troops had to retreat because of explosive devices Boko Haram planted in the forest, according to military sources and a vigilante who was with the troops. On Monday, troops re-entered the forest and on Tuesday afternoon they raided two Boko Haram camps and rescued scores of girls and women. Information about the fate of the kidnapped schoolgirls has been spotty and inconsistent, with some school officials giving conflicting figures for the number of girls who were abducted or escaped their captors. \"We have no idea where the Chibok girls are or were,\" CNN correspondent Christian Purefoy said Tuesday. The name Boko Haram translates to \"Western education is sin\" in the local Hausa language. The group has said its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. CNN's Jennifer Z.

Speaking ahead of the weekend meeting with Swansea, Meyler said: 'We are not going down. We just have to get into the mentality that it is not good enough to accept the 3-2 defeat by Chelsea, even if they are likely Premier League champions.

Ms Jobs, 51, called former First Lady Hillary a 'revolutionary' woman, and added that it's not just because she's a woman - but 'the type of woman she is'. Speaking to Time 100, Ms Jobs said: 'Hillary Clinton is not familiar. She is revolutionary. Not radical, but revolutionary: The distinction is crucial. She is one of America\u2019s greatest modern creations. Laurene Jobs, pictured, widow of Apple's Steve, has strongly backed Hillary Clinton for president . Laurene Jobs said that Hillary Clinton, right, has 'judgment and wisdom' based on her public service . 'Her decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities. Indeed, those same decades have conferred upon her what newness usually lacks: judgment, and even wisdom. 'It matters, of course, that Hillary is a woman. But what matters more is what kind of woman she is.' Mrs Clinton announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination on Sunday - and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet 'ordinary' voters in Iowa. But she was blasted for her 'staged' visit on Tuesday morning to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa. Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs Clinton, claimed the whole event was orchestrated 'from beginning to end'. STAGED: Clinton sat to talk with three young Iowans at a coffee shop on Tuesday \u2013 all of whom were driven to the event by her Iowa campaign's political director . NOT SO ORDINARY: Austin Bird is a Democratic Party insider who chauffeured Vice President Joe Biden around Davenport, Iowa in October during a pre-election campaign trip . Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour. The three got the lion's share of Mrs. Clinton's time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a 'roundtable'\u2013 the first of many in her brief Iowa campaign swing. Bird himself is a frequent participant in Iowa Democratic Party events. He interned with President Obama's 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport. 'What happened is, we were just asked to be there by Troy,' Bird said Wednesday in a phone interview. 'We were asked to come to a meeting with Troy, the three of us, at the Village Inn.' The other two, he confirmed, were University of Iowa College Democrats president Carter Bell and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland employee Sara Sedlacek. 'It was supposed to be a strategy meeting,' Bird recalled, 'to get our thoughts about issues. But then all of a sudden he says, \"Hey, we have Secretary Clinton coming in, would you like to go meet her?\"' 'And then we got in a car \u2013 Troy's car \u2013 and we went up to the coffee house, and we sat at a table and then Hillary just came up and talked with us.' Bird said 'we all were called.' 'I mean, Troy asked us all to do \u2013 to go to a meeting with him. And we didn't really know what it was about. I mean, he did. He knew.' It's unclear how many Iowans featured in photographs with Clinton that rocketed around the country on Tuesday were planted. 'The mayor of LeClaire was there, and his wife was there,' Bird said, recalling the scene at the coffee shop. Price was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until a month ago. Clinton's team tapped him last week to be its political director in Iowa. He did not respond to a request for comment. Bird is a government and community relations coordinator at Genesis Health System in Davenport, Iowa, according to his LinkedIn profile. A coworker at Genesis said Wednesday that Bird is 'basically a lobbyist in training. That's what he wants to do.' Bird disagreed, saying his role was 'more public relations.' He's also an outspoken progressive whose Facebook wall shows he ordered a 'Hillary For President' bumper sticker\u00a022 months ago. 'Is it 2016 yet?' he wrote in May 2013. Clinton's nascent campaign has carefully coordinated her image as a spontaneous, handshaking populist in her first days as a candidate, posing with Pennsylvanians at a gas station and venturing into an Ohio Chipotle restaurant for lunch. When no one recognized the former first lady \u2013 she was wearing sunglasses \u2013 the campaign leaked information to The New York Times so its reporters could get security-camera footage to prove she had tried to mingle with voters. Scripting supposedly off-the-cuff appearances is common in presidential politics but could hurt Clinton especially hard since her gonzo road-trip journey to America's broad midwest is designed to counter her image as cold, calculating and politically venomous. And planting party insiders in place of typical Iowans won't go over well in the Hawkeye State, where pressing the flesh and collecting caucus votes is a quadrennial full-contact sport. ASTROTURF: Setting up faux events for news cameras is nothing new in politics, but Iowans take presidential contests seriously and could punish Clinton for the deception . THE FIXER: Bird said Troy Prince (left, pictured with VP Joe Biden), who was executive director of the Iowa Democratic Party until he left last month to help Clinton's statewide political effort, recruited him and others to attend the 'spontaneous' coffee meeting . Clinton's campaign has already taken heat for depicting at least three people in her campaign launch video as 'everyday' Americans who were actually partisans with political connections. One was even a former campaign manager for Wendy Davis, the Texas Democrat who mounted a failed bid for Texas governor last year. In LeClaire on Tuesday,\u00a0Bloomberg and other outlets referred to Bird as a 'student' at St. Ambrose University, not as a hospital government-affairs staffer with Democratic party street-cred. He does study at St. Ambrose \u2013 part-time. But Bird's ties to the party are deep enough that his Facebook wall includes a photo of him standing in front of Joe Biden's limousine in Davenport. 'I was driving the Vice President when he was in town in October,' Bird noted in a Facebook comment. Biden was not there on official government business, but for a campaign stop in support of Democrat Bruce Braley. 'The Vice President will attend a grassroots event for Braley for Iowa with Representative David Loebsack,' according to White House press guidance for his October 27, 2014 schedule.\n"]}

Accusing the CPS of \u2018heinous errors\u2019, Mr Lamb said the authorities should examine precedents of people with dementia being brought to trial. \u2018My concern is that because the DPP and indeed the Crown Prosecution Service at a local level have made errors in this case, heinous errors by failing to bring a prosecution earlier when there was evidence there to do so,\u2019 he said. \u2018This matter should not be concluded by the DPP and should be brought before a court. \u2018There is a precedent of people with dementia being brought to trial. With allegations as serious as this it seems to me that this is the right approach.\u2019 Mr Hunt said Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Theresa May had been \u2018right\u2019 to express concern at the decision. \u2018I think she\u2019s right to do so and I think Boris is right to do so as well because I think we all think that there is something very, very strange here where someone was signing official letters only a matter of weeks ago and is somehow escaping prosecution for something so incredibly serious,\u2019 he said. Meanwhile Lord Carlile, a Lib Dem peer and leading legal expert, said that although there was strong evidence that Lord Janner was suffering from dementia, the decision not to proceed with legal action should be reconsidered. Earlier this week, leading politicians from seven parties came together to attack the latest decision not to prosecute Lord Janner and demand the decision be reversed amid public concerns of a \u2018whitewash\u2019. The cross-party group, led by Labour\u2019s Simon Danczuk, wrote to The Times saying: \u2018As long as justice is not seen to be done and the greater public interest is not served, the public will see attempts to investigate establishment figures involved in historic child abuse as a whitewash.\u2019 Mrs Saunders announced last week that there was enough evidence to charge Janner with 22 crimes against nine victims but said it was not in the public interest to do so. Mrs Saunders\u2019 decision not to prosecute came after a two-year multi-million pound inquiry by Leicestershire Police examining allegations spanning four decades. It led to a furious public row with victims saying they will never see justice and police threatening a High Court legal challenge. Mrs Saunders defended her decision saying it is her duty to make the right judgment even when it is unpopular. But the Daily Mail can reveal Clare Montgomery QC offered advice which could have supported a move to prosecute. Mayor of London Boris Johson, pictured, has expressed concern over the failure to charge Lord Janner . She told Mrs Saunders it was unlikely prosecutors would be \u2018susceptible\u2019 to a judicial review if she took Janner to court. Senior lawyers feared Janner\u2019s legal team, closely advised by his QC son Daniel, would try and block the case with a High Court challenge focusing on his ill health. But Mrs Montgomery is understood to have said that as long as prosecutors had the support of his alleged victims it was unlikely any such review would be successful. Eleanor Laws QC, who was leading counsel to the investigation, recommended that he be charged. Mrs Laws pointed to overwhelming evidence and horrific corroborating accounts provided by victims during the exhaustive police inquiry. Mrs Saunders concluded that there was enough evidence to prosecute but Janner\u2019s ill health prevented any criminal proceedings. She appointed two of the country\u2019s foremost dementia experts who concluded his dementia is at an advanced stage and would never improve. They were Professor Michael Kopelman, of King\u2019s College London, and Dr Katherine Humphreys, of the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust. At least 10 men with dementia have been convicted of child sex offences since 2010, including six in the past year. Mrs Saunders has told friends that she has no intention of quitting over the Janner row. One said: \u2018She says she will not be hounded out of office. She is absolutely determined to stay in post.\u2019 In the coming months, she is due to rule on whether Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News UK should face corporate charges over the phone hacking scandal which engulfed the News of the World. Scotland Yard detectives investigating alleged corporate crime are seeking to bring a case that would force senior executives to be held to account. A Crown Prosecution Service spokeswoman confirmed Mrs Laws advised Mrs Saunders to prosecute and said Mrs Montgomery was consulted on an \u2018ancillary matter\u2019. She said: \u2018It is the Director of Public Prosecution\u2019s job to make these extremely difficult decisions, and that is what she has done in this case. \u2018As the ultimate decision maker, she receives advice from a number of internal and external lawyers but the decision is based, ultimately, on her own assessment of the relevant law and circumstances of the case, no one else\u2019s.\u2019\n"]}

Light sentence: Mark West, 32, will serve four months prison and eight years probation for having sex with a student in 2012 . Mark Steven West, 32, who is married with a child, was sentenced Tuesday to four months in jail followed by eight years probation after pleading guilty to the improper relationship while working at Spring High School in Spring, Texas. He had previously said the girl instigated the moment, seducing him by saying she was 'feeling horny'. The girl admitted as such to police also, telling them  she encouraged West to have sex. But despite the light punishment, the judge was scathing in handing down her punishment, saying that just three weeks after the incident the girl  graduated, which would have made their encounter legal. 'You did it because you enjoyed the attention of young girls,' State District Judge Catherine Evans said, according to The Chron. 'We're talking about a razor thin margin of three weeks between what separates a felony crime from a poor decision to have an inappropriate extramarital affair.' State law prohibits educators having sex with students. West apologized to the court, saying he made 'bad decisions made on impulses' and was being 'selfish'. School officials were first tipped off to the allegations after hearing rumors and seeing inappropriate interactions between West and certain students at the school on separate occasions, according to court documents. He tickled one girl, lifted up another, and was accused of making inappropriate comments to two others. West was interviewed by a senior staff member at Spring High School in Texas in December 2012 after administrators heard that he made a sexual remark about one female student and possibly had sex with another. He was also investigated in the 2011-2012 school year for inappropriately touching a female student on her lower back. No charges were filed due to lack of evidence but he was ordered not to have any contact with female students. One staff member said she was extremely uncomfortable by the number of lengthy 'closed door meetings' West was having with female students. The staff member said she observed students leaving his office, smiling and laughing, with their clothes and hair disheveled. Scene: West has resigned from his post as assistant principal at Spring High School, Texas, after the incident became public. He eventually pleaded guilty and no longer works as a teacher . She also saw West 'body slam' a female student, in a playful manner, on a couch in the lobby office. Students told investigators about rumors that West had sex with a student at the 2012 Project Prom event. The woman, who is now at college, told investigators she seduced West. She told investigators that she came on to West first and that he initially refused her advances, according to court documents. She said she started to flirt and talk with West, allegedly telling him that she 'was horny and wanted to have sex with him'. The woman said she continued her advances until he agreed to meet her in his upstairs office. Once alone, the two of them began to kiss and then had sex, investigators said. West denied having sex with the student, but authorities felt they had enough evidence to file charges. He was placed on administrative leave and then resigned. While he maintained his innocent for some time, West finally admitted what he had done and pleaded guilty. Spring High School Principal Donna Ullrich issued a statement to parents, writing at the time of West's arrest: 'I want to assure you that the safety of our students is of the highest importance at Spring High School. 'The criminal history and references of job applicants are routinely checked before they are hired. 'The administration at Spring High School takes every allegation seriously and will conduct a thorough investigation and expose inappropriate behavior when necessary.' West's wife testified at his hearing that he is still not working as a teacher. The prosecution had pushed for a much higher sentence, reiterating that he was not just a teacher, but a principal.

Researchers have isolated bacterial DNA of several strains of the disease from the bodies of mummies found in the crypt of a church in the city of V\u00e1c in Hungary. They found 14 different strains of TB bacteria that had infected eight of the bodies in the tomb and traced them all back to a single source. Mummified remains of 28-year-old Ter\u00e9zia Hausmann (above) found in the 18th century crypt of the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary, were among those found to have been infected with tuberculosis by the researchers . They say the strains of TB they found all evolved from a single germ that had began infecting people during the late Roman period. Professor Mark Pallen, a geneticist at Warwick University who led the work, said: 'By showing that historical strains can be accurately mapped to contemporary lineages, we have confirmed the genotypic continuity of an infection that has ravaged the heart of Europe since prehistoric times.' Historians have long taught that Native American populations were almost wiped out by diseases such as tuberculosis, brought to the New World by European explorers. But a new theory suggests the arrival of seals and sea lions could in fact be to blame. Scientists believe the marine animals brought the disease to South America where it spread - long before Christopher Columbus arrived in 1492. While estimates vary, it is thought that 95 per cent of the 20 million people living in the Americas before the Europeans arrived were killed by \u2018new\u2019 diseases carried by explorers. Anthropological geneticists Anne Stone of Arizona State University and Johannes Krause of the University of Tubingen in Germany have studied pre-Columbian Mycobacterial tuberculosis genomes. The team examined TB DNA from 1,000-year-old skeletons found in Peru as well as other samples and compared them to modern genomes. They found a clear relationship to TB lineages in animals - especially seals and sea lions. The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communications, used samples taken from the mummified remains of 26 people who had been buried in a cyrpt of V\u00e1c's Dominican church during the 18th century. Workers attempting to restore the church stumbled on the remains of nearly 200 people in the crypt in 1994. The bodies had become naturally mummified in the exceptionally dry air. The bodies, many of whom had been wealthy Catholics, had been placed in the crypt fully clothed and in coffins between 1731 and 1838. Walled up and forgotten for about 150 years, the coffins were discovered when a construction worker tapped on a wall during renovation work. Part of the wall gave way to reveal coffins decotrated with skulls and stacked from floor to ceiling. The researchers found that eight of the 26 bodies they examined showed signs that they had died of tuberculosis, five of whom had suffered from multiple strains. It is the first evidence that mixed infections of multiple strains of TB were common in the 18th Century. The researchers found that all of the strains belonged to a lineage of Tuberculosis bacteria known as Lineage 4, which still causes more than a million TB cases a year in Europe and America. By analysing the DNA from these bacteria, the researchers were able to trace back the evolutionary history of the different strains they found by looking for genetic changes that had occurred. Tuberculosis is caused by the bacteria\u00a0Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The researchers found several different . The mummies were discovered during restoration work at the Dominican church in V\u00e1c, Hungary (above) They found that they all seemed to stem from a single strain of tuberculosis that was in existence between 396CE-470CE. The Roman dating supports recent scientific estimates that tuberculosis first emerged about 6,000 years ago, although some have suggested the disease is tens of thousands of years old. Writing in the journal, the researchers said: 'Phylogenetic dating places the most recent common ancestor of this lineage in the late Roman period. 'Our dating is consistent with evidence that a strain containing the pks15/1 deletion was present in Britain by the second\u2013fourth centuries CE.' The findings also suggest that at the time when the mummies died, TB was already raging in Europe and killing large numbers of people even before urbanisation and crowded housing created devastating epidemics. The dry climate in the crypt preserved the bodies and clothing of the people placed there in the 18th century . The church where the mummies were found is in\u00a0V\u00e1c in the Pest region of northern Hungary (shown above) Professor Pallen, who conducted the work along with researchers at the University Birmingham, University College London, the Hebrew University in Jerusalem and the Hungarian Natural History Museum in Budapest, said: 'Microbiological analysis of samples from contemporary TB patients usually report a single strain of tuberculosis per patient. 'By contrast, five of the eight bodies in our study yielded more than one type of tuberculosis - remarkably, from one individual, we obtained evidence of three distinct strains.' Dr Gemma Kay, the first author of the study, added that their analysis had revealed some of the tragic toll the disease was having at the time. She said: 'Poignantly, we found evidence of an intimate link between strains from in a middle-aged mother and her grown-up daughter, suggesting both family members died from this devastating infection.'\n"]}

On its website, the NCAA prominently states, \"It's our commitment -- and our responsibility -- to give young people opportunities to learn, play and succeed.\" And later, it says that \"in the collegiate model of sports, the young men and women competing on the field or court are students first, athletes second.\" But the NCAA is taking a very different position in response to a lawsuit filed by former University of North Carolina athletes. The lawsuit claimed the students didn't get an education because they were caught up in the largest known academic fraud scandal in NCAA history. In its response, the NCAA says it has no legal responsibility \"to ensure the academic integrity of the courses offered to student-athletes at its member institutions.\" Even with pages of online information about academic standards, and even though the NCAA has established a system of academic eligibility and accountability that it boasts of regularly, NCAA attorneys wrote in this court filing that \"the NCAA did not assume a duty to ensure the quality of the education of student-athletes,\" and \"the NCAA does not have 'direct, day-to-day, operational control' \" over member institutions like UNC. \"It's nonsense. It's double talk,\" said Gerald Gurney, a former athletic-academic director who is now president of The Drake Group for academic integrity in collegiate sport. \"If you look at their basic core principles, it's all about academics, the experience, the integration of academics, and the education of the student is paramount,\" Gurney said. \"They seem to talk out of both sides of their mouths.\" The NCAA referred calls for comment to an online statement, which read in part: . The NCAA believes that the lawsuit misunderstands the NCAA's role with respect to its member schools and ignores the myriad steps the NCAA has taken to assist student-athletes in being equipped to excel both in the classroom and on the playing field. \"This case is troubling for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that the law does not and has never required the NCAA to ensure that every student-athlete is actually taking full advantage of the academic and athletic opportunities provided to them,\" said Donald Remy, NCAA chief legal officer. In its response to the lawsuit, it also likened its role to that of the American Bar Association or American Medical Association, and said that those entities are not sued every time a lawyer or doctor acts inappropriately. The scandal at UNC involved thousands of athletes who, over 18 years, were funneled into classes that never met, where advisers fudged grades and accepted plagiarism so that athletes who were falling behind in class could remain eligible to play sports. Mary Willingham, the UNC whistleblower turned NCAA critic, has for years said that athletes across the country are accepted to colleges even though they're academically underprepared and then pushed into classes where little work is required. The system of eligibility that the NCAA brags about, she says, is a sham. \"Why do we go through the trouble of compliance if we can't legitimize that the courses are real and the education is real anyway? It makes no sense,\" said Willingham, who recently wrote a book about the UNC scandal called \"Cheated.\" \"If they can't legitimize that the academics are real and take no responsibility for that, then why certify students semester after semester to play? It's lost its meaning for me.\" The NCAA's claim that it's hands-off when it comes to athletics seems to be a direct contradiction of what the organization has been repeating for years, not just in the rhetoric on its website, but in speeches by its president, Mark Emmert, and in court defending itself from numerous lawsuits over paying athletes. For example, before it lost a case filed by former UCLA player Ed O'Bannon, suing for the right of athletes to make money off their images and likenesses, the NCAA stood on the pillar of amateurism, insisting that college athletes are paid with an education. That's the defense the NCAA is now using in another class action filed by big-time sports attorney Jeffrey Kessler, seeking to make college sports a free market where athletes are paid salaries based on their value. In response, the NCAA said that what sets college sports apart from pros is education: Consistent with \"its commitment to amateurism, member institutions conduct their athletics programs for students who choose to participate in intercollegiate athletics as a part of their educational experience and in accordance with NCAA bylaws.\" Attorney Michael Hausfeld, who represented both O'Bannon and now the UNC athletes, said this: . \"This startling inconsistency is unfortunately all too symptomatic of the NCAA's shifting rhetoric and faltering commitment to its college athletes. NCAA President Mark Emmert has repeatedly proposed that 'What we live for is the education of our athletes,' but the NCAA's record tells a far different story.\" But Rick Burton, professor of sport management at Syracuse University, said it's not realistic to think that the NCAA would regulate every professor and every course an athlete might take at each university across the country. \"I understand, I think, where the NCAA is coming from. We would not let the NCAA come in and tell us how to run our chemistry department at Syracuse University,\" he said. \"It sounds like someone is trying to say the NCAA should have been supervising that department at the University of North Carolina, and there's no logic to that,\" he said. \"The people who are saying the NCAA should be held accountable for academics at every school are just looking for an opportunity to throw rocks at the NCAA.\" UNC, which was also sued, has admitted to the fraud, but also asked for a judge to throw out the case, saying the athletes waited too long -- seven years -- to sue and the \"educational malpractice\" theory doesn't apply. UNC claims it is protected by state law. This is reminiscent of another NCAA reversal. The NCAA, which was founded a century ago to protect athletes from \"dangerous and exploitive athletic practices,\" now says it does not enforce health and safety rules. In fact, in response to a lawsuit filed by the family of a player who died in 2011, the NCAA wrote: \"The NCAA denies that it has a legal duty to protect student-athletes.\" A CNN investigation found that the NCAA has failed to open investigations in several cases where safety rules allegedly were broken. It has also fallen behind in imposing rules for concussions -- far behind even the NFL. Ramogi Huma, president of the National College Players Association, and a leading thorn in the NCAA's side for decades, said this latest backpedaling from the NCAA leaves him wondering why the organization exists at all. \"There's nothing left the NCAA can claim it does that is beneficial to college athletes or society. One has to wonder what does the NCAA do if it doesn't protect players? If it doesn't play a role in the education of college athletics? It begs the question of why does the NCAA exist -- and why does it have a tax exemption.\"\n"]}

The Premier League champions were last year deemed to have breached FFP regulations, before being fined \u00a350million and ordered to operate with a \u00a349m transfer kitty this season. City are debt-free, mainly thanks to the vast wealth of owner Sheikh Mansour\u2019s heavy personal investment, whereas Manchester United were able to splash out \u00a3150m on new talent in the summer, despite being in the region of \u00a3400m in the red. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has slammed FFP for protecting the established order of clubs . Ahead of the Manchester derby on Sunday, Kompany has hit back at the FFP rulings, claiming they prevent other teams challenging the established sides at the upper echelons of the game. 'Just who is FFP protecting?' Kompany told the Sunday Mirror. 'For me, it is protecting those few clubs who were already geared up to be successful. \u2018Just because a club is part of the established order doesn't mean they should be guaranteed success forever,\u2019 he added.

Give them better tactics and equipment. Kenya's politicians and public have struggled with these ideas over and over. But the blood of 147 people slaughtered and 79 more injured, when Al-Shabaab opened fire at a college campus in Garissa on Thursday, has them debating them with renewed vigor. Many Kenyans had believed that security improved enough since Al-Shabaab held Nairobi's Westgate Mall under siege for four days in September 2013, resulting in the deaths of 67 people. Had it not, the massacre at Garissa University College would have been far worse, some say. Two police officers were on duty. But the number of people killed in the attack is plaguing Kenyans with self-doubt. With the highest death toll since the 1998 al Qaeda bombing on the U.S. Embassy in Nairobi, many are saying security is still not tight enough. And days after the attack authorities revealed that rapid response forces arrived hours late, allowing the killings to drag on. So what should Kenya do? The answer is elusive. The battle with Al-Shabaab is not a new one, and every attempt at countering them has only helped stall the inevitable -- another attack, more deaths. Here are some of the problems plaguing Kenya's security efforts. The notion of building a wall is somewhat grandiose, since the border runs some 700 kilometers or 435 miles. Even with a wall, militants could arrive by sea to coastal towns in Kenya that have been Islamist strongholds. The border crosses through remote areas, and many Somalis have fled their country south to Kenya. Garissa, for example is populated by mainly ethnic Somalis. The border region has become so violent that many non-Muslims have fled it, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. The students at the university, many of them Christians, hailed mostly from other parts of Kenya. But Kenyans also cross north into Somalia, some to fight for Al-Shabaab, then they return home to help whip up fervor with its Kenyan affiliate al Hijra, CFR has said. The security situation may have deteriorated in recent years after Kenya's incursion into Somalia to battle Al-Shabaab there, CNN's David McKenzie said. Kenya wiped out some of the group's key bases there in Operation Linda Nchi, which began in 2011. But it made the group more diffuse -- and more likely to pop up and hit soft targets in Kenya, said terrorism expert Sajjan Gohel. It's also simply very difficult to protect every single target from attacks -- especially in Kenya. \"It will be impossible to provide adequate security throughout the country,\" Gohel said. Kenya will need a lot more help from its neighbors and the international community, including the United States, to contain Al-Shabaab. \"Al-Shabaab is not just a local terrorist group, it's a transnational outfit,\" he said. \"It operates throughout a number of countries and recruits even people from the West.\" McKenzie says Al-Shabaab is trying to maintain its relevance as other terror groups like Boko Haram, ISIS and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula vie for power and influence. It's also possible that Al-Shabaab may have abandoned aspirations of seizing a large chunk of territory after taking losses in Somalia, and decided instead to focus purely on terrorism. These attacks by small armed groups against civilians are cost-effective, Gohel said. \"If the group's infrastructure and resources remain intact in Kenya, we will see more attacks taking place. This is not a one-off incident.\" Allegiances among groups can also play a role. In 2012, Al-Shabaab declared complete allegiance to al Qaeda. Previously, there had been a rift among the Somali terrorists over whether or not to pursue global jihad or just to concentrate on Somalia. Courts have snagged parts of Kenya's security plans over fears of government overreach. Kenya's government had recently passed a controversial law giving itself broad powers in the war on terror. But the High Court saw it as an affront to civil rights, and it struck down many of its details early this year, according to CFR. This included blocking the enrollment of 10,000 new police recruits. On Thursday, Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta gave a directive to have them processed. He has already been accused of taking advantage of the public's fear of Al-Shabaab to widen police powers. Kenyatta's government, which is Christian dominated, has wielded an abusive hand against ethnic Somalis and other Muslims in Kenya, CFR and Human Rights Watch both have said. In April, security forces carried out raids in Nairobi and in regions with large Muslim populations, targeting ethnic Somalis. \"Security officers from multiple agencies raided homes, buildings, and shops, carting away money, cell phones, and other goods,\" HRW said. \"They harassed and detained thousands -- including journalists, refugees, Kenyan citizens and international aid workers -- without charge, and in appalling conditions for periods well beyond the 24-hour legal limit.\" The draconian approach has helped create fertile ground for extremists looking to radicalize individuals. The United Kingdom included Garissa in a recent warning of an imminent attack. And last month, the U.S. Embassy warned of possible attacks \"throughout Kenya in the near-term\" after the reported death of a key al-Shabaab leader, Adan Garaar, who was accused in the Westgate attack. Some Kenyans are now asking why security forces did not react to those warnings in advance by putting security in place. CNN's Soni Methu reported from Nairobi, and Ben Brumfield wrote this story in Atlanta; CNN's Nick Thompson contributed to this report.\n"]}

Reports of child sex abuse cases have risen by more than 60 per cent in the wake of investigations such as Operation Yewtree and the Rotherham scandal. Figures revealed thousands more people had contacted police with allegations of abuse since 2011, with nearly 9,000 reports filed in 2014. Despite a surge in reports, the number of arrests fell by nine per cent, prompting critics to accuse the Government of failing victims of abuse. Among the forces to see the largest rise in reported cases was South Yorkshire where there was a 577 per cent increase over the last five years. It comes after an estimated 1,400 children were abused in the area over several years, with officials in Rotherham ousted as a result of the scandal having been deemed not fit for purpose. While only 74 cases of child sex abuse were reported to the force in 2011, 501 were investigated in 2014, the figures, obtained via Freedom of Information request by The Guardian, revealed. But while a surge in the number of reports suggested victims felt more comfortable coming forward, a decrease in the number of arrests made prompted critics to accuse police of not doing enough. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper described the ratio of reported crimes to arrests as a 'national scandal'. 'This isn't a problem from the past. It is a growing problem the Government should be confronting right now. 'Victims of child sex abuse are being let down when alongside a 60 per cent increase in reports there has been a nine per cent drop in arrests for child sex abuse, as well as falling prosecutions and convictions for child abuse offences as the police are unable to keep up.' Shaun Wright, the former Police and Crime Commissioner of South Yorkshire Police, resigned over the force's handling of the Rotherham child abuse scandal . Thames Valley Police made 191 arrests in relation to child sex abuse - up from just 13 in 2011. Campaigners said the rise was indicative of increased awareness of child sexual abuse among the public. 'In recent years there has been a huge increase in awareness of child sexual abuse and it\u2019s good that more people are coming forward,'\u00a0Alan Wardle, NSPCC head of policy and public affairs, said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the figures were a 'national scandal' 'Since the Operation Yewtree police investigation was launched in 2012, the NSPCC helpline has seen a huge rise in the number of victims willing to speak out, get support and help bring abusers to justice. 'In the year after Yewtree was launched there was an 81% increase in calls about sexual abuse to the NSPCC helpline and this surge continues. 'When children take the extremely difficult step of reporting abuse we need to ensure they are properly supported and get the help they need when they are brave enough to give evidence in court.' Operation Yewtree was sparked by revelations made in 2012 that the late comedian Jimmy Savile had sexually abused children and young women in the 1970s and 80s. The Scotland Yard investigation is understood to pursue three lines of inquiry. The first relates to Savile's crimes while the second to allegations made against him and other public figures. The third was set up to investigate reports made as a result of the high-profile Savile allegations.\n"]}

Burnley are next in action on Sunday when they host Tottenham. Duff, 37, said: 'He has been first class. I've learned a lot from him, little things he does, and I think he will go on to be a top manager. 'Hopefully he will stay here a bit longer and (Burnley will) achieve some more with him. I cannot see why somebody will not give him an opportunity from what he has done here.' Asked if he would be surprised if former Watford boss Dyche ever managed England, Duff said: 'No, in a word, having worked with him and the way he gets the best out of players. 'Most of our players have played the majority of their careers in the Championship or lower than that and we are competing against multi, multi-million pound squads and we are alive and kicking. 'So, he has managed to get the best out of us. If he can do that at a higher level, why not?' Duff has hopes of following Dyche into management himself after retirement. The former Northern Ireland international still intends to prolong a career that has seen him play in the country's top-eight tiers with Cheltenham and Burnley, but he has firm plans for life beyond it. He said: 'I've done my Pro Licence and I want to stay in football after I've finished playing. 'I have no plans to stop playing at the minute. I still love getting up for training in the morning. It's not a bad job running around chasing after a football. 'But you look at the game differently when you get to my age.

But despite the fact that Blair has a record of three general election victories, only one Shadow Cabinet minister, Chuka Umunna, could be bothered to attend. During a dinner held in an Indian banquet hall in Morden, Blair (pictured last week in Newton Aycliffe, County Durham) name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements . The dashing Shadow Business Secretary is being mentored by Lord Mandelson, the former Blairite Cabinet minister, who wants to see him as the next Labour leader. The programme for the dinner, held in an Indian banquet hall in less-than-glamorous Morden High Street, South London, was littered with errors and even misspelt Umunna\u2019s name. A clearly uncomfortable Blair name-checked Ed Miliband only once, devoting his speech instead to his own achievements. Bizarrely, Blair shared a stage with musician Steve Brookstein, who won the first X Factor ten years ago but whose career sank even faster than Blair\u2019s popularity. Brookstein\u2019s last record (he had a box full of them to give away) is an apt metaphor for Blair in the eyes of the current Labour Party. It\u2019s called The Forgotten Man. One of many critics of Blair\u2019s appearance on the election trail was George Galloway, who is fighting to retain Bradford West for the Respect party. He said: \u2018Blair dripping with blood, pockets stuffed with gold beyond dreams of avarice, comes out fighting for New Labour.\u2019 Galloway is one to talk. Last year he earned \u00a3303,000 in addition to his MP\u2019s salary, mostly from \u00a31,600-an-hour appearances on Iran\u2019s Press TV and Russia Today.

The other parties want to spend more and don\u2019t want to talk about taxation. \u2018The deficit? Apparently if it\u2019s left alone it\u2019s just going to melt away.

It was as if these two warriors might collapse on camera if either of them moved, so they clung on and spoke happily if wearily after supplying the goals which fuelled this fight-back at Leicester.

But he and Terry are not shaped that way and the pride burned through their yellow shirts as they led their team-mates to salute three thousand noisy Chelsea supporters in the corner of the King Power Stadium. They had trailed to a goal from Marc Albrighton after a slightly lethargic first-half display but came out inspired and soon levelled through Drogba, before Terry put the Londoners ahead, 12 minutes from time, and Ramires curled the third into the top corner. The strike by Ramires triggered an ironic chorus of 'Boring Boring Chelsea' from the visiting fans and they sang long into the night, aware that their team can be crowned champions on Sunday at Stamford Bridge if they beat Crystal Palace. Mourinho tried to play down the party vibe but they will come in expectation because this has the feel of a procession after breaking through an awkward sequence of games with only one fit centre-forward, who happened to be 37.

Drogba\u2019s legs don\u2019t cover quite the same ground at quite the same rate as they once did. He rarely gets clear of the back-line, it has been a long time since he screamed one into the top corner and his touch can be heavy. Until Wednesday night it had been a long time since he found the net. You have to go all the way back to Newcastle away in December, when he came on in a bid to rescue Chelsea from their first defeat of the campaign, and almost managed it. Drogba has an impossible-to-pin-down ability to influence the game and his desire glows as fiercely as ever. He energised Chelsea with the equaliser - just as he once did in Munich in the Champions League final. He missed chances and he might have scored more, but he never stopped showing for the ball or leading by example to those team-mates who have yet to cross this finish-line in a title race, as injured striker Diego Costa and Loic Remy looked on from the stands. Mourinho wanted all of his squad to travel and prepare together at St George\u2019s Park as a show of solidarity as they closed in on the goal. This was where the head-tennis video was filmed which went viral on Wednesday. Six Chelsea players headed the ball back and forth across the dinner table until it reached John Obi Mikel, on the end, who nodded it into a bin.

Chelsea's players looked dejected after falling behind to Albrighton's goal just before the end of the second half . On Wednesday, it was over to the legends who have made the journey before to respond to the challenge set down by Nigel Pearson\u2019s vibrant team, who offered more evidence, even in defeat, that they are capable of surviving the drop. Terry scored his seventh of the season, forcing the ball in from close range after Kasper Schmeichel had saved from Gary Cahill at a corner. And Petr Cech came in for Thibaut Courtois and played superbly, making a crucial save to thwart Paul Konchesky when the game was goalless. Courtois hurt his hip during Sunday\u2019s draw at Arsenal and was on the bench. Cech came in for only his fifth Premier League game of the season, but buoyed by the knowledge he had not conceded in this competition for more than a year. Leicester started at a healthy tempo, seeking to use the electric pace of Jamie Vardy, only to see their rhythm disrupted to injuries which forced Andy King and Robert Huth off before the interval. Chelsea dominated from midway through the first half but that did not prevent Leicester from taking the lead on the break when Matty James released Vardy down the left. Vardy beat Terry to the ball and cut his cross low and deep. It might have been aimed at Leonardo Ulloa, but it bypassed the Argentine striker and Cesar Azpilicueta slipped as he tried to adjust his feet.

Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho (right) and Leicester City boss Nigel Pearson have a talk in the tunnel before kick off . The upshot was a simple finish for Albrighton, arriving late with the ball set nicely and Cech\u2019s goal hopelessly exposed. He had not scored for more than four years but he made no mistake, sliding it low into the net. The King Power erupted as home fans detected an improbably fifth win on the bounce and another year in this lofty company. But Drogba soon punctured those hopes when he reacted swiftly to beat substitute Ritchie de Laet to a low cross from Branislav Ivanovic and hooked it past Schmeichel. It was a different game from this point. Chelsea had re-emerged in a different mood. There was extra urgency about their game and they would go on to win by more than one goal for the first time since a 5-0 win against Swansea in mid-January. Drogba fired one chance over and another wide but Terry produced the second, just as it seemed Mourinho would have to settle for a point. It could have been many more but Ramires made it three. And it wasn\u2019t boring at all.\n"]}

Spieth, already dreaming about winning the Masters, was already an extremely talented golfer in 2009 and he casually informs the family that he's the No. 1 junior golfer in the country. The 21-year-old impressed many following Sunday's big victory with his manners and affable manor as well as his golfing skills. As he stepped off the final green he embraced, in turn, his father Shawn, his mother Chris, his college sweetheart Annie, his brother Steven, who plays college basketball, his grandfather and various friends. He then went back on to the 18th green and formally acknowledged the patrons crammed into every available space. 'He's just a class guy in every way and it's difficult not to root for him,' said golf legend Phil Mickelson. Spieth hugs members of his family after securing his first ever major title at Augusta National . Spieth walks back onto the 18th green to formally acknowledge the large crowd watching on . Spieth (right) pictured with his college sweetheart girlfriend Annie . Another legend impressed by Spieth was Jack Nicklaus, who posted this tribute: 'Congratulations to an exceptionally talented young man. That was an incredible performance. 'Jordan is so beyond his years. I like everything about him. He's polite, he's humble, he handles himself so well, on and off the golf course. And he's obviously a wonderful player and now a Masters champion.' The one family member who wasn't present to enjoy the celebrations was Jordan's 14-year-old sister Ellie, who suffers from a neurological disorder that places her on the autism spectrum. The siblings regularly Facetime each other and every time they talk Ellie asks he brother if he has won yet. 'I'll finally be able to tell her yes,' he said, smiling. 'I know she was watching on television and I think she's going to be a bit jealous of us all hugging round the 18th green,' he said. 'She's going to want a present.' Spieth spends time with his family as he poses for a photo with sister Ellie (centre) and brother Steven (right) Spieth pictured in his younger days playing basketball left-handed . Golf should not have been Spieth's game at all. Nobody in the family plays \u2014 they are all big basketball fans. But Spieth was given a set of plastic clubs at the age of four and took it from there. When he set out he was ranked 809th in the world. Now he is No 2 behind Rory McIlroy. In 18 months, he has banked more than $13 million on the PGA Tour alone. In his past four events he has won two and finished second twice and when he says: 'I don't see this as a great run of form, I see this as normal,' it does not come across as at all boastful. Jesuit High School was recently in the news for all the wrong reasons when the Daily Mail Online exposed former pupil, Parker Rice, as one of the Oklahoma University students filmed conducting his Sigma Alpha Epsilon brothers along in a racist chant on a bus last month.\n"]}

The scathing critics told the six-months pregnant meteorologist Kristi Gordon that her 'front end looks like the Hindenburg\u00a0and your rear end looks like a brick s***house.' Fans jumped to support her when Gordon read out excerpts from the letters and emails on TV, but it seems that abuse of pregnant TV presenters daring to get on with their jobs during their pregnancy is nothing new. Australian presenter and model Nicky Buckley famously soldiered on with her presenting job on The Sale of the Century after falling pregnant in 1997, continuing to wear the glamorous, figure-hugging gowns her job required of her. 'Never in my wildest dreams did I expect the barrage of abuse that was bestowed upon my unborn baby and me by a multitude of critics who were determined to dampen the joyous marvel of pregnancy,' Buckley, now 49, writes in her newly-released memoir. Scroll down for video . Pregnant and proud: Buckley copped heavy criticism for showing bump on TV but stood her ground . Speaking to Daily Mail Australia about the book, 'Nicky Buckley: A Memoir', she shared just how bad the criticism became. 'I was told I jammed fax machines at Channel 9 and newspapers - with faxes coming in from people commenting negatively.' 'At the time there wasn't any maternity wear except kaftans which covered you from head to toe, hiding your boobs and bump,' she said. Bitterness over bump: Buckley wore sexy dresses that revealed her bump, \u00a0shocking TV audiences, and hit back in magazine interviews saying she refused to bend to critics . TV Scandal: Nicky Buckley enraged public by staying on air throughout her nine month pregnancy . Family first: Buckley bucked preconceived notions of women in TV and continued to work to support family . As her role was to wear glamorous evening dresses and there wasn't adequate maternity wear available, she  just went up a size from her usual attire and got on with things. 'I wasn't out to raise the flag or cause a stir, I simply wanted to work \u2013 as was my right. Yet in doing so people had other opinions and thought I shouldn't be seen publicly with a bump.' 'I had a mortgage, people tend to forget  and put you in a bubble. But I still had a mortgage and do you think I should just stop and be taken off the air?' Game model: Game show host and model copped flack for her bump and continued to work to pay the bills . Glamorous to gritty: Despite her glamour role, Buckley says the pregnancy showed the ugly side to TV . 'I needed to pay the bills and I was happy with what's going on,' she said. 'Looking back I'm proud of how strong I was. I can't push the point hard enough, I was steadfast and strong, I was going to work and do my job.' 'I couldn't wait to share the news with my girlfriends but after the usual squeals of congratulations  they said \"what are you going to do about work?' she reflects in the book. A friend even made the shocking suggestion to Buckley that they could build her a podium to stand behind once she started to show. Host to husband: Buckley married her co-host Murray Bingham and subsequently had three children with him . While taken aback, she said she believes people saw her role as glamorous one and being pregnant clearly didn't fit with that image. 'Despite my blossoming belly and impending birth, unintentionally I had sparked a very public debate that divided a nation - was pregnancy  something to be ashamed of? Were pregnant women even attractive?  said Buckley. Not to mention the dress she wore on the runway at a Myer Fashion Festival that saw eyebrows raised. 'That caused a real stir. It was a dress with a cut out heart over the belly, people saw it outrageous but the designer and I thought it was beautiful and embraced the bump and fashion all at the same time.'

{"question_id": 629, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Jackson Gordon is no ordinary 21-year-old. By day he is an industrial design student at Philadelphia University, but Gordon has another side to him -- a side altogether darker, tougher and more enigmatic. Hanging in his workshop Gordon has a full suit of armor plating, cape and cowl -- matte black and built to stop a knife. Gordon has an alter ego: the Dark Knight himself, Batman. You might expect his origin story to be cloaked in mystery, but speaking to CNN Gordon is quick to explain how the transformation took place. Gordon says his calling came five years ago when he began experimenting with cosplay. \"Previously I'd been involved with costume making... I'd made a version of the Batsuit from Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight Trilogy' and I really liked that suit,\" Gordon says. But, as elaborate as his design was, it lacked the functionality or the authenticity of the genuine article. \"I was frustrated every time I wore it,\" Gordon explains. \"It really limited my mobility and I didn't like that -- it didn't go with the character.\" In September 2014 he bit the bullet, deciding \"to do another one that wouldn't inhibit my mobility and would actually provide protection and function more like Batman's actual suit.\" The Batsuit had to be strong -- tough enough to withstand the stab or slash of a knife, the impact of a punch or a baseball bat, but light and articulate enough to make it practical. Striking such a balance required expensive materials, and they didn't come cheap. Gordon therefore fired up a Kickstarter campaign. He \"didn't really think anyone would fund it or even be interested in it\" -- he raised $1,255 in 6 days. \"It was a little surprising,\" Gordon demurs. Writing out his shopping list, it was important that \"everywhere, even places without armor plating, had some sort of protection.\" Kevlar was sourced as the base fabric, making it \"cut and slash resistant to bladed weapons, but breathable and wearable all day.\" Eschewing conventional materials, Gordon opted for a form of memory foam, built around key areas to \"squish and compress,\" dissipating the impact of blows. After much experimenting with \"polycarbonates and extruded PVC materials,\" \u00bc\" Kydex (or ABS) plastic formed the tough armor plates, located on the torso, forearms and shins. Stab resistant, Gordon says \"it can take anything but a gunshot.\" The cowl was more problematic, being \"nearly impossible\" to craft out of the same materials within the limits of his workshop. Gordon therefore took a mold of his head using Sintra plastic, \"working on top of that with different sculpting clays and soft plastics to get it into a recognizable Batman shape.\" Using a two part box mold Gordon was able to create a \"silicone jacket\" of this, into which liquid polyurethane was poured, forming the final, \"durable and functional\" cowl. Gordon (who doesn't appear to be related to Gotham City's police commissioner, James Gordon) is also an expert in Shaolin Kung Fu: he is both brains and brawn, a cross between Bruce Wayne and Batsuit designer Lucius Fox from Nolan's Batman trilogy. Legendary, the production company behind the films, has taken note of his design and given it their seal of approval. The Batsuit has made appearances at conventions and proved a showstopper among his fellow students and the faculty. \"People love the theatricality of it,\" its designer says. That the product so closely mimics DC's fantastical comic book creation has had resonance. He has already begun manufacturing the cowls for the public, with \"fully adjustable\" jackets going up for sale on his site Armatus Design \"in the next couple of weeks.\" The jackets have received particular attention. Gordon has received \"easily over 50 requests from people,\" and not just from the cosplay community.  \"They range from recreational use to martial artists... but also motorcycle and All Terrain Vehicle riders who want protective gear and prefer the look and functionality of [Gordon's] suit.\" Perhaps because of their versatility and the small matter of copyright issues, those that go on sale will not feature the iconic bat symbol. Gordon says his fledgling business will remain small whilst he's at University -- he has to finish he studies after all, and won't be using the project towards his degree credits. For now the Batsuit and Armatus Design will remain a one man operation: such is the life of a superhero.\n"]}

{"question_id": 635, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Lauren Crawley was given a new platinum implant . Facial palsy, or weakness of the facial muscles, can stop the patient's eyelids closing properly. Lauren Crawley, 54, a housewife from Kings Langley, Hertfordshire, was given a new platinum implant that makes it easier to blink again, as she tells THEA JOURDAN. THE PATIENT . A few years ago I started losing my sense of balance and developed tinnitus - my GP referred me for scans which showed I had a large but benign brain tumour behind my left ear. Surgery was the only option. Thankfully the operation, in July 2012, was a success. But my facial nerve, which was wrapped around the tumour, was damaged. I'd been warned that facial palsy could be a side-effect, but it was still a shock seeing my face in the mirror - the left side was droopy. Apparently, it's the same thing that can happen after a stroke. I felt very self-conscious, but the problems weren't just aesthetic. I'd lost the hearing in my left ear as well as my sense of taste, and my mouth became dry. Eating and speaking were difficult - and, worst of all, my left eye was permanently open and I couldn't even blink with it. To close it, I had to push the upper lid down with my hand. The eye itself was dry and painful. To sleep, I had to seal it closed with tape. I'd been told that about half those with the condition do improve, so I was hopeful. I tried lots of things to improve the muscle tone, including facial massages, taught by a physiotherapist. I also had electric impulse therapy to shock the muscles back to life. But nothing worked. It was very stressful - I stopped socialising as much, in case people stared. After a year, it was clear the nerve would never work again so I was referred to Raman Malhotra, a plastic surgeon at the facial palsy clinic at the Queen Victoria Hospital. He explained he could put a special platinum chain into my eyelid which would weigh it down and help it close by itself - I'd be able to open the eye easily because the muscle controlling this wasn't affected. Apparently, surgeons used to use gold, but platinum is better because it doesn't irritate the eye's inside lining. It is also more dense than gold, so you need only a thin chain, which meant people would barely see the implant through my eyelid. I had the operation under sedation and local anaesthetic in February last year. Surgery for a benign brain tumour behind her left ear damaged a facial nerve wrapped around it . My eye was wide open as they injected anaesthetic into my eyelid and the skin around my eye, then made lots of tiny stitches into my eyelid to hold the chain in place. It was strange watching it all but didn't hurt. I went home that day, and the difference was immediately obvious. The eye gently shut, and stayed shut, of its own accord. I could go to sleep without needing tape. I can't feel the implant, no one can see it, and I can blink normally. The procedure has made me look more normal - people don't stare as much. It's really boosted my confidence. THE SURGEON . Raman Malhotra is a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Around 100,000 people in Britain have facial palsy. It can be caused by a stroke, if the stroke affects the area of the brain that sends signals to the facial nerve. It can also be a result of traumatic injury, damage after surgery, or simply because of a virus damaging the facial nerve - this happens in Bell's palsy, which affects more than 28,000 people a year. Facial palsy affects not just appearance, but lots of functions, too. The facial nerve - which rises from the bottom of the brain on both sides, then sends branches across the face - controls the tongue's taste buds, for instance, and the salivary glands, so patients may suffer from dry mouth. Most also have difficulty blinking, because the nerve controls the muscle that makes the eye blink shut. However, it does not control the levator muscle, which holds it open. While many patients will recover, with symptoms easing within eight weeks, Lauren's facial nerve was too damaged to regain function. When she first saw me, her left eye was wide and staring because the lower lid was also pulled down and sideways. This can cause all sorts of problems, from dryness to injury. Five years ago, I would have recommended a gold implant - in the shape of a very thin bar - fitted under the eyelid to allow her to close the lid. The extra weight makes the eyelid heavier, so it closes automatically when the levator muscle relaxes. This procedure is used widely across the NHS. But I now believe platinum is much better. It's 10 per cent more dense than gold, so you can make the implant thinner without losing weight. Platinum is also inert - gold will cause reactions, such as irritation and inflammation, in about 5 per cent of people. The left side of her face was droopy - until now . I helped design a special system of individual links of platinum which we can join together with nylon to create a chain of the desired length and weight. For Lauren, I used three links weighing 0.4g each. This is much easier than stitching in a single bar of metal and then finding that it is too heavy or light. This way, we can easily add or remove a link. In 2013, we carried out a study at Queen Victoria Hospital, using platinum chain implants on 18 patients. Only two needed adjustments and 80 per cent said that they hardly noticed the implant, compared with just 20 per cent of patients who had a gold implant (the study will be published in the British Journal of Ophthalmology). First, we anaesthetised the skin around Lauren's eye. Then, on a workbench, I linked the correct number of platinum links to form the weight I required (I'd previously done a trial run, sticking temporary weights to the outside of her eyelids to check the weight). I made an incision across the outside of her eyelid, where it makes a natural crease, making sure not to cut through to the eyeball. I placed the links inside this incision, above the eyeball, stitching the chain in place from the outside in, before closing the incision. These nylon stitches stay in place for several years before being reabsorbed by the body. By then, the links will be embedded in surrounding tissue. When the chain was in place, and the eye was open, it sat above the eyeball so it did not come into direct contact with that delicate part of the eye. Even when the eye is shut, the implant doesn't touch the cornea. When Lauren wanted to blink, her brain switched off the levator muscle, which keeps the eyelid wide open. The corresponding muscle, the orbicularis occuli muscle, which should pull the eyelid down, does not work in Lauren's case because it is controlled by the facial nerve. The percentage\u00a0of stroke patients\u00a0who are affected\u00a0by facial\u00a0weakness . However, the new chain meant that the eyelid was sufficiently heavy to fall, thanks to gravity. Although it wasn't a perfect solution - at first, Lauren's eye closed more slowly than a fully functioning eyelid - at least she could blink again. Over time, the blinking gets better as muscle tone improves. Risks include infection and bleeding, but these are rare. I hope the implant will last Lauren a lifetime and that platinum implants will become the treatment of choice. ANY DRAWBACKS? 'Gold upper eyelid implants have been used for decades for facial palsy,' says Saj Ataullah, a consultant oculoplastic surgeon at Manchester Royal Eye Hospital. 'Platinum is more expensive, but seems to be better since it is inert and does not cause reactions. And as the implants are less bulky, it's also superior cosmetically. 'This chain segment innovation seems to work well. Any procedure can result in post-operative problems, but these appear to be rare. 'Longer-term follow-up is needed before we can conclude that chain-link implants are truly superior to other platinum weights, such as bars. But they are promising so far.' The operation costs around \u00a33,000 privately. The NHS does not automatically fund it .\n"]}

The project is being called \"Selena the One.\" Twenty years after she was killed by her fan club president, Selena remains incredibly popular, with her Facebook page recording 2 million likes and fans continuing to post videos and tributes. Selena will be the first figure to use the Acrovirt technology, Quintanilla said. \"I'm excited at the fact that she will be the first ever, and the fact that she's a Latina makes it even more awesome,\" she said. \"It's not about replacing Selena in any shape, way or form; it's just something to help her legacy continue growing.\" The family intends to expand her legacy in another way: with some new music. Selena the One \"will release new songs and videos, will collaborate with current hit artists, and aims to go on tour in 2018,\" said a statement on Selena's Facebook page. Selena isn't the first performer to try the virtual route. A Michael Jackson hologram appeared at the Billboard Music Awards in 2014, and a hologram of Tupac Shakur performed at Coachella in 2012. But the new technology is a step forward, Quintanilla said. \"People don't realize how fast technology is moving,\" she told Billboard. \"This is something that we're building for another two to three years, so when 2018 comes around they'll be like, 'Oh, OK, we get it.' \" Fans can join an Indiegogo campaign, www.selenatheone.com, to support the launch.

We Britons certainly do love to keep things local, as over three quarters of us (80 per cent) go crackers for cheddar, crowning it our favourite cheese variety. Least favourite cheeses, according to a new survey, are Greek feta, French Camembert and American cream cheese. And while the French are renowned for their love of the stinky stuff, we are not far behind, with the average Briton eating their way through four servings a week. The research, which was conducted by pickle brand Branston also revealed that a surprising one in four cheese fanatics (26 per cent) admit to eating melted cheese with everything. A third of Brits (30 per cent) say they can't enjoy cheese without a dollop of their favourite pickle while almost three quarters admitted to reaching out for a cheese sandwich when feeling peckish. In fact, three in ten office workers tuck into cheese sandwiches for lunch each work day without fail. If we're not putting slices in our sandwiches, one in ten of us are eating whole blocks of cheese in one sitting. Our second favourite is mozzarella with almost two in five (38 per cent) enjoying the ever versatile soft Italian cheese. Close behind in third place is traditional red Leicester (32 per cent).

{"question_id": 642, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)It's no surprise which image is making the headlines from this week's gathering of leaders from nearly three dozen nations in Panama: A historic handshake between President Barack Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro. But this first meeting of Obama and Castro since they announced plans to start normalizing diplomatic ties should not be the end of the summit story. Or at least Obama is hoping it won't be. After all, the President has had some unhappy experiences at hemispheric summits, where the headlines have often focused on some less than flattering moments. The reality is that the United States has been losing ground in this increasingly important region, and Obama needs to put on a strong performance in Panama at the Summit of the Americas if the U.S. is to have a chance of improving ties with neighbors who should be best friends, but who have drifted away as America has been focused on challenges at home and instability in the Middle East. Unfortunately, America has lost influence in Latin America to a hyperactive China, a cunning Russia and a troubling Iran, all of which have made inroads in the region at Washington's expense. This gathering therefore offers a chance for the U.S. to reverse the tide and build on the potential offered by a natural alliance strengthened by millions of people with Latin American and Caribbean blood who make their homes in the United States. The foundations for a strong hemispheric bloc are there. But they need attention, and the Panama meeting offers a good opportunity to start building. But first: Do no harm. Large diplomatic gatherings are minutely orchestrated events, and the U.S., with its vast experience in preparing for high-level multilateral meetings, knows the importance of dotting the I's and crossing the T's. But this hasn't stopped recent summits descending into diplomatic and PR disasters for the U.S. Just look at the last summit, held in Cartagena, Colombia, which stayed in the news much longer than anyone expected after Secret Service agents embarrassed the United States by hiring prostitutes and bringing them to their hotel rooms, in violation of basic security protocols. They were reportedly caught after one of the women accused an agent of refusing to pay an agreed fee. As a result of all this, the Americans looked dumb, incompetent -- and cheap. And back in 2009, the President -- new on the job -- was caught flat footed by a fast-talking, fiery anti-American president of Venezuela. The late Hugo Chavez outplayed the leader of the free world, who had just taken office and was trying to show America's new \"outstretched hand\" toward the foe of the George W. Bush era. The summit hit a depressing low for the Obama administration when Chavez walked up to Obama and, as the cameras clicked, handed the American President a copy of the book \"Open Veins of Latin America,\" which blames the region's woes on the U.S. and Europe. Yet the problems in Cartagena weren't just symbolic. Regional leaders lined up against Washington, which had refused to include Cuba in the summit, and vowed they would not hold any more of the gatherings unless Havana was also invited. America was cornered. All this stands in contrast to the optimism of the early Clinton years, when the President issued an invitation to \"democratically elected\" heads of state of Latin America, which was then breaking the chains of military dictatorship. Back then, the U.S. had just led the creation of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and actually seemed to stand for something attractive to the region, namely democracy, free trade and economic growth. That's what it should aim for every time: articulating a clear vision and rallying neighbors behind it. Can Obama manage something similar this time? True, the President has come armed with his new Cuba policy. Unfortunately, in an effort to placate critics who say Obama is not doing more for pro-democracy activists, the White House has miscalculated with Venezuela, handing the repressive regime of Chavez's successor, Nicolas Maduro, a stick with which to beat the U.S. Obama has long and rightly ignored Maduro's claims that the U.S. planned to overthrow him. But a modest plan to impose sanctions has suddenly handed Maduro -- who has presided over an economic catastrophe in his country -- a way to portray himself a victim of the U.S., something he will no doubt play that up in Panama. All this risks again reviving memories of past tensions with Latin Americans who already have complicated feelings toward the U.S. over its Cold War support for unseemly right-wing dictators, a policy it claimed to pursue in the name of preventing Soviet-backed communism from taking hold. But those days are behind us. Today, the people want prosperity, they want democracy, and they want the rule of law -- all of which leave a potential opening for the United States. Too many national leaders are eroding democratic norms: Opposition leaders are in prison in Venezuela; a prosecutor who criticized the President was found dead in Argentina; press freedom is under siege in several countries; and corruption is reaching new highs. All of this suggests that if Obama plays his cards right, he will have the opportunity to explain to the people of Latin America that their goals are also America's goals; that like them, he supports democracy, human rights, the rule of law, full freedom of expression and free elections in every country. The fact that he met with Cuban dissidents was welcome, and sends a message that he is not neglecting other issues such as human rights as he recasts relations with Cuba. For the millions in Latin America that still live in poverty, these freedoms can seem like a distant luxury. But if Obama can show them that the United States is a true partner in efforts to improve their lives, then he will leave a longer-lasting legacy in the region than just a handshake.\n"]}

An experimental cancer drug axed over poor results may have the ability to reverse the effects of Alzheimer's, experts have revealed (file picture) The drug worked by blocking a process that breaks nerve connections in the brain used to store memory. Researchers say the study has led to the launch of human trials to test the efficacy of the drug in Alzheimer's patients. Stephen Strittmatter, the author of the report, published in Annals of Neurology, said: 'With this treatment, cells under bombardment by beta amyloid plaques show restored synaptic connections and reduced inflammation, and the animal\u2019s memory, which was lost during the course of the disease, comes back. The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health which launched a programme to test failed drugs on different diseases. Mr Strittmatter and his co-author Christopher van Dyck have already started a 'multi-site clinical trial' to determine whether the drug can also benefit Alzheimer's patients. According to the Alzheimer's Society, there are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain - a figure that includes 40,000 younger people.

It reports that the financial cost of dementia to the UK is \u00a326billion a year. The Daily Express reports the charity's head of research Dr James Pickett as giving the latest treatment a cautious welcome. He said: 'Drug development can take decades, so repurposing pre-existing drugs for dementia is a promising avenue to find new treatments as they have been shown to be safe to use in people and can lead to clinical trials sooner. 'As we learn more about the causes of dementia, there is hope that treatments we routinely use for other diseases may also work for people with dementia.'\n"]}

{"question_id": 649, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers vowed not to give up on Champions League qualification after a convincing 2-0 win over Newcastle. The Reds moved within four points of the Barclays Premier League top four after goals from Raheem Sterling and Joe Allen saw off the struggling Magpies at Anfield. With fading champions Manchester City now looking vulnerable in fourth, Liverpool's hopes - which took a hefty blow in back-to-back losses to Manchester United and Arsenal - could have been reignited. Raheem Sterling wheels away in celebration after scoring Liverpool's opener . Rodgers said: 'The players and myself are very motivated to do the best we can. We have shown we can put results together consistently. We have important players coming back which is good news. 'But we are looking for other teams to slip up and we have to continue winning. 'There are teams above us but, as we have seen last year, there can be changes and points dropped and I think there will be changes.' Sterling curls the ball in to the far corner of Tim Krul's net to give Liverpool the lead . Liverpool, inspired by Philippe Coutinho, started superbly with Sterling scoring after nine minutes and several other chances being created. Newcastle rallied before the break and had a strong penalty appeal turned down but Allen made the game safe in the second half. Rodgers said: 'It was a good performance. I thought that our attacking play was very bright, we looked exciting going forward, we worked hard in the midfield. Sterling's shot nestles in to the back of the net as Krul picks himself up from Anfield turf . 'At times our possession could have been better but we had a real attacking intent and created chances and could have scored more goals.' The defeat was Newcastle's fifth in succession and left them with work still to do to ensure they do not get pulled into the relegation battle. Their misery was compounded when Moussa Sissoko was sent off for what was deemed a second yellow card offence, when he caught Lucas Leiva on the ankle. Manager John Carver admitted Sissoko could easily have been shown a straight red, however. Allen secured three points for Liverpool that narrowed the gap on Manchester City . He said: 'The sending off, it could have been a straight red, I will be honest. I have said that to Moussa, I am quite straight and I won't defend anyone if it is indefensible.' Asked if Sissoko could be fined, Carver said: 'I am sure there will be some kind of disciplinary procedure. I said before the game we needed to keep 11 players.' While Carver did not complain about that decision, he was angry that Ayoze Perez did not earn a penalty after apparently being felled by Dejan Lovren. He said: 'The game hinged on a huge decision. I don't want to be seen to be a moaner but it is fact we don't get big decisions for whatever reasons, it could be me. I have spoken to the referee, but it doesn't help me.' Lovren clears the ball with his head as Lucas and Perez also scrap for the ball . Carver did see reason for some optimism, feeling that his side's performance was much improved from their derby loss to Sunderland last time out. He said: 'I thought the first nine minutes we were very tentative, nervous after our performance against Sunderland. It was a bad goal to concede. 'After that we grew into the game. It is easy to crumble at Anfield but we didn't. One or two guys rolled their sleeves up. 'I think we got a response. We didn't get a result but I saw enough. 'There are lot of positives to take from the game. A lot of people expected us to get a hiding and I think we held our own for the majority of the game.'\n"]}

Labour's plans to impose rent controls are \u2018economically illiterate\u2019 and will slash investment in new housing, leading to more tenants being evicted by their landlords, experts warned last night. Ed Miliband yesterday confirmed he would press on with controversial plans to cap rents despite warnings from housing experts, business and even Labour figures that they will backfire. He said rent controls \u2013 demanded by the militant Unite union that bankrolls Labour \u2013 would give millions of \u2018forgotten\u2019 renters a fairer deal by helping those stuck in so-called Generation Rent by soaring house prices. But the Generation Rent campaign group said his plans were \u2018riddled with loopholes\u2019 and may make tenants\u2019 lives worse. Under the proposals, landlords would have to offer three-year tenancies and would be banned from raising rent above inflation during this time. Alex Hilton, director of Generation Rent, said long tenancies were welcome but the proposal would give landlords an incentive to evict their tenants and would not keep rent down, adding: \u2018This is because they have no plans to limit rent rises between tenancies \u2013 or after your first three years are up. \u2018Worse than this, Labour\u2019s planning new ways for landlords to evict you within that period, for example to sell your home or get it back for other reasons. These loopholes are scary when you think they\u2019re attached to a big financial incentive to use them \u2013 because that\u2019s the only way they will be able to put rent up in the first three years.\u2019 In another loophole, hundreds of thousands of properties owned by buy-to-let investors could be excluded altogether. Most buy-to-let mortgages specify maximum tenancies of one year. Labour sources said these landlords would be able to offer short tenancies \u2018where contractually obliged\u2019. Senior Tories called the proposal \u2018drivel\u2019 and said it would suppress house building and push rents up. Chancellor George Osborne described the plan as a \u2018totally economically-illiterate statement that grabs headlines, but is dismissed by every expert who looks at it\u2019. The Confederation of British Industry said the way to tackle the housing crisis was to build more homes, and warned the plans could discourage investment, thereby forcing up rents in the long term.

Senior Tories called the proposal \u2018drivel\u2019 and said it would suppress house building and push rents up. Pictured: Mr Miliband and Boris Johnson on the Andrew Marr show today . Some senior Labour figures also have concerns, with former minister Tessa Jowell warning against a cap last week, saying: \u2018Before taking a step like that you have to be clear it doesn\u2019t have unintended consequences.\u2019 Yesterday, however, she insisted she supported the plan. Housing spokesman Emma Reynolds was forced on the back foot yesterday after footage emerged of her in 2013 saying: \u2018I don\u2019t think rent controls are going to work in practice.\u2019 Yesterday, she said she meant \u2018Seventies-style controls\u2019 and said Labour\u2019s plan was different. Rent controls were widely blamed for a reduction in rented housing in Britain and Europe in the Seventies as investment dried up. The bad old days: A Manchester slum . Rent controls have already proved a disaster in Britain after they were introduced in the First World War. The measure was supposed to be temporary \u2013 but was only dismantled by Margaret Thatcher in the Eighties. During this time the private rented sector collapsed from 90 per cent of the country\u2019s housing stock to less than 10 per cent. By the Seventies, rent controls were widely blamed for the slum conditions in much of Britain\u2019s remaining private rented stock. Landlords, unable to make a sustainable return, neglected homes and dragged their feet over the most basic repairs. Unscrupulous operators such as Peter Rachman, whose name became a byword for exploitation, drove out tenants who had legal rent protection to replace them with others who were not covered by the law. Gordon Brown\u2019s favourite economist Paul Krugman, a Nobel prize-winner, has warned that attempts to control rent always fail, writing: \u2018Almost every freshman-level textbook contains a case study on rent control, using its known adverse side-effects to illustrate the principles of supply and demand.\u2019 The socialist Swedish economist Assar Lindbeck once said: \u2018Next to bombing, rent control seems in many cases to be the most efficient technique for destroying cities.\u2019 Alan Ward, of the Residential Landlords Association, warned that rent controls could result in a return to the ugly conditions of the past, adding they \u2018would lessen investment in new homes when we need more and serve only to paper over cracks in the market\u2019. He said: \u2018For some, it is easier to achieve a cheap political point by calling for rent controls than provide a prescription for growth in the private rented sector. Ultimately, tenants would lose as they find themselves forced into slums rented by Rachman landlords operating outside the legal market.\u2019 David Cox, of the Association of Residential Letting Agents, said rent controls led to a fall in supply and the standard of homes because \u2018landlords do not have the money to invest in ongoing maintenance\u2019. Sam Bowman, of the Adam Smith Institute think-tank, said rent controls were \u2018a stunningly bad idea that could clobber renters\u2019. He said they would give landlords a huge incentive to raise rents at the start of a tenancy, adding: \u2018Labour has unwittingly announced a policy that could devastate cities and exacerbate the housing crisis.\u2019 The Institute of Economic Affairs said the proposal \u2018would result in higher rents, a reduction in the quality of rented property and in the supply of homes to rent without improving affordability\u2019.

{"question_id": 653, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Marco Rubio is all in.  The Republican senator from Florida has announced that he is seeking the Republican presidential nomination, running on an optimistic message that he embodies the promise of the American Dream. With his youthful energy and Hispanic roots, it's tempting to see Rubio as the new blood that the GOP needs in order to compete against Hillary Clinton in 2016.  Yet Rubio has been his own worst enemy on what could have been his two signature issues: immigration reform and Cuba relations.  He holds little appeal to Latino voters.  And unless he can offer new ideas, his climb to the Republican nomination will be steep. Back in 2013, Rubio was a member of the Senate \"Gang of 8\" that crafted a bipartisan proposal for comprehensive reform, including a path to citizenship for the nation's estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants.  He later distanced himself from the bill after it ran into resistance from House Republicans, and now says he favors a piecemeal approach, starting with securing the border. His retreat on immigration means that Rubio has missed an opportunity to set himself apart from most of the presumptive Republican presidential candidates.  That's a shame, for this issue was supposed to be his calling card to Latino voters. Instead, Rubio has embraced a typical conservative approach to immigration.   He believes that President Obama's Deferred Action program, offering deportation relief to young immigrants, should be ended.  He has stated that the President's executive action on immigration, on hold pending a circuit court review, sets a \"horrifying precedent.\" Meanwhile, both the Deferred Action program and President Obama's executive action on immigration are overwhelmingly favored by Hispanics.  No wonder the research firm Latino Decisions reports that, \"We find no evidence that Rubio's candidacy will draw significant Latino support for his candidacy or for his party more generally.\"  So, if Rubio is counting on his ethnicity and personal history as the son of immigrants to win over fellow Hispanics, he is mistaken. At a private breakfast Monday for supporters, Rubio described running against \"one candidate in the race who's from yesterday, and one who wants to take us back to yesterday.\"  But when it comes to Cuba policy, Rubio himself seems firmly stuck in the past.  Over the weekend, he called the recent thaw in relations between the two countries ridiculous. He has warned that Cuba is taking advantage of the United States.  Here, he is an increasingly lonely voice.  Most Americans support better relations with Cuba, as do a majority of Cuban-Americans.  By clinging to the notion that isolating Cuba is better than engaging with the communist country, Rubio has marginalized himself on an issue where he could have provided insight and leadership. Immigration and Cuba policy aside, Rubio's political philosophy will be a tough sell to Hispanics.  He is a fierce opponent of \"Obamacare\" and wants the law repealed.  However, the Affordable Care Act has led to a 12.3% drop in the Hispanic uninsured rate, making Latinos the demographic with the largest gain in insurance, thanks to the law.  (In fact, Rubio signed his own family up for \"Obamacare\" on the Washington exchange, taking advantage of a generous federal subsidy offered to lawmakers.) Rubio favors smaller government, while Latinos are more likely than the general public to say they favor a bigger government that provides more services over a small government that provides less.  And though Rubio doubts that climate change is caused by humans, The New York Times has noted that Latinos view global warming as a problem and favor government action on the issue. Sure, Rubio is young and charismatic.  But his work on the failed immigration bill notwithstanding, Rubio has a significant lack of accomplishments to show for his five years in the senate.  In February, he was reported as topping the list of absentee lawmakers by the website Politico. Another Rubio weakness is his lack of bold policy proposals.  Consider that his fellow contender for the GOP presidential nomination, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, has been willing to present new ideas to the Republican base, such as reforming the criminal justice system and legalizing medical marijuana.  Or that another GOP candidate for president, Sen. Ted Cruz  of Texas is entirely comfortable with his image as a conservative firebrand.  By comparison, Rubio seems cautious and ill-suited to the task of rousing Republican voters. With his early leap into the 2016 race, Marco Rubio is positioning himself as the next generation of GOP leadership.  Unfortunately, a fresh face on stale ideas is not a winning combination -- not for Rubio, and not for Latino voters.\n"]}

A\u00a014-year-old boy from Blackburn, Lancashire was arrested after he allegedly communicated with Australian men over a plan to use knives and swords to hack officers to death in Melbourne on Anzac Day, which takes place this Saturday. When the alleged plot was uncovered by Greater Manchester Police, they tipped off Australian authorities who swooped on the terror suspects, arresting five men over the weekend. Police are now working to shore up security for a string of Anzac Day events taking place in London, including services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey to be attended by the Queen, Prince Philip and Prince William. Scroll down for video . Arrest: Police have arrested a 14-year-old on suspicion of helping to plot a terror attack in Australia (file photo) Greater Manchester Police said today that the 14-year-old was first arrested on April 2 after police intercepted communications between him and an Australian man, allegedly relating to a planned terrorist attack. He was then re-arrested on Saturday on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, and is currently being questioned by police in custody. Five men from Melbourne were arrested over the planned attack after British authorities passed on their findings to police in Australia, and on Saturday 18-year-old Sevdet Besim was charged with terror offences. It was claimed today that the Australian men planned to knock over a policeman with a car then stab him to death, in a chilling echo of the murder of British soldier Lee Rigby two years ago. A security official told ABC that the terrorists then planned steal the dead officer's gun and go on a shooting rampage which would not end until they were shot dead themselves. The alleged plot is similar to the killing of Fusilier Rigby, who was run over by Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale outside his barracks in Woolwich before they attacked him with knives and attempted to behead him. Attack: Sevdet Besim, pictured, has been charged with planning an attack in Melbourne on Anzac Day . Arrest: A suburban house in Melbourne where one of the alleged terrorist plotters was arrested on Saturday . Tony Mole, from the North-West Counter-Terrorism Unit, said today: 'We have uncovered communication between an individual in the North West and a man in Australia to what we believe is a credible terrorist threat. 'As soon as this information came to light we acted quickly with the relevant authorities here and abroad and this has resulted with officers from the NWCTU arresting a teenager. 'The nature of the communication is currently under full assessment and subject to investigation. 'We are continuing to work closely with the police in Australia and Lancashire and I want to reassure the public that we have not uncovered an imminent attack in the UK and there is no immediate threat towards the communities of Lancashire, the North-West and the UK.' Australian Federal Police said: 'Victoria Police and the Australian Federal Police can confirm a link between the arrest of a 14-year-old boy in Blackburn, Lancashire in the United Kingdom on Saturday with Operation Rising, a joint Counter Terrorism Team operation. 'The nature of the communication will form part of the investigation and therefore it would not be appropriate to comment further.' In the wake of the Melbourne arrests, Australian officials have ramped up security for Anzac Day events, while police in Britain  are reviewing the arrangements for Anzac Day celebrations in the UK. This year's commemorations are considered particularly significant, as April 25 marks the 100th anniversary of the start of the ill-fated Gallipoli campaign, which led to the deaths of 11,500 troops from Australia and New Zealand. Horrors: Soldiers pictured during the Gallipoli campaign, which left thousands of Allied troops dead . Commemoration: The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh pictured laying a wreath at the Cenotaph in 1990, the 75th anniversary of the campaign; they are set to do the same during a ceremony on Saturday . London is hosting three commemorative ceremonies on Saturday - a dawn service at Hyde Park Corner, a wreath-laying ceremony at the Cenotaph on Whitehall and a service of thanksgiving at Westminster Abbey. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh are due to attend the services at the Cenotaph and Westminster Abbey, while the Duke of Cambridge will join them at the Cenotaph and Princess Anne will attend the dawn service. Security is already set to be high at all three events, with those attending told to carry photographic ID, but it could be ramped up further after the recent terror arrests. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu of the Metropolitan Police said over the weekend: 'Following counter-terrorism arrests in Australia this weekend and allegations of attack planning against Anzac Day commemorations and police officers in Australia, we are reviewing security plans at related events in the UK. 'We already have protective security plans in place for major Anzac events in the UK but as a sensible precaution all forces have been asked to review security arrangements at related events to ensure they are safe and secure for the public and officers. 'While there is no information to suggest a specific threat to related events in the UK - and the current UK threat level remains unchanged - the public should remain vigilant.' At least 50 events commemorating Anzac Day are set to take place in other parts of the UK this weekend, including services at Manchester Cathedral, Winchester Cathedral and Oxford University. Australian police said on Saturday that Sevdet Besim and another 18-year-old were planning to use 'edged weapons' to attack officers in Melbourne while Anzac Day celebrations are taking place. The teenagers were said to be inspired by Islamic extremist Numan Haider, who was shot dead by police in September last year after he attacked officers with a knife outside a Melbourne police station. Like Britain, Australia has been suffering from an apparent upsurge in would-be jihadists as the rise of ISIS has attracted young Australians to fight in the Middle East and plot terror attacks at home.

The California firm said it will announce a 'home battery' and a 'very large utility scale battery' in a letter sent to investors. While products such as this already exist, founder Elon Musk thinks they 'suck', according to Tesla's investor relations director, Jeff Evanson. Scroll down for video . The California firm said it will announce a 'home battery' and a 'very large utility scale battery' in a letter sent to investors. The company already offers battery packs (pictured) for its\u00a0SolarCity project, but it is unclear whether the latest product will build on this design . There are a number of home battery packs on the market. Most work by powering up overnight when electricity rates are cheaper. Users can then switch them on during the day to use the home during the day. They can be used as back up power in the case of an emergency, or be used to hold power from renewable energy sources. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption. 'One can imagine a day when battery storage technology or micro turbines could allow customers to be electric grid independent,' the report said . Musk announced the event last month in a cryptic tweet that said there will be a launch of a 'major' new line of products that is 'not a car'. The event will be held at Tesla's Hawthorne, California, Design Studio on April 30 at 8pm. PT. '[At the event] we will explain the advantages of our solutions and why past battery options were not compelling,' the company said. Home batteries power up overnight when electricity rates are cheaper. Users can then switch them on during the day to use the home during the day. In February, Musk said their version of a home battery would be ready for a public debut within months and that it should start going into production by the summer. It is likely to build on the power packs used in Tesla's range of electric cars such as the Model S. 'We are going to unveil the Tesla home battery, the consumer battery that would be for use in people's houses or businesses fairly soon,' Mr Musk told analysts earlier this year. 'We have the design done, and it should start going into production in about six months or so.' He didn't reveal what a home battery would be used for, but it could act as a generator during a power cut, for example. While products such as these already exist, founder Elon Musk (left) thinks they 'suck', according to Tesla's investor relations director, Jeff Evanson. On the right is an image of a Tesla residential battery being installed . Tesla's billionaire founder last month fuelled speculation by saying it 'not a car' and added the product will be revealed at the company's California, Design Studio on April 30 at 8 p.m. PT . But at a conference last year, Tesla's Stationary Energy Storage Director Arch Padmanabhan revealed some of Tesla's initial plans. The Mirai features the Toyota Fuel Cell System, which combines fuel cell technology with hybrid technology. The firm said it can serve as a 'high capacity power supply during emergencies'. The Mirai converts the DC power from the CHAdeMO power socket in the boot to AC power, using an attachment. Toyota calls it a vehicle-to-home system. Tesla's home battery could work in a similar way, or be a standalone battery. This included a 400 kWh commercial/utility battery for large buildings and a 10 kilo-Watt hour residential battery. Rival car manufacturer Toyota already uses a hydrogen fuel cell in its Mirai car that can be removed and used to power a home. According to the Japanese car maker, the battery can supply electric power to an average home for a week. Last year, Tesla Motors unveiled plans for a 'Gigafactory' designed to help the firm ramp up production of batteries for its electric cars, and now homes. Tesla said the factory will cut current battery production costs by up to 30 per cent, and will be powered predominantly by renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar. Elsewhere, Mr Musk is already the chairman of SolarCity - a company that offers solar power systems for homes - and Tesla's home battery could be an extension of this. These batteries 3ft tall (0.9 metres), and can be controlled remotely using a smartphone app. Tesla would not comment on whether the new batteries will work in the same way. Home battery packs could disrupt the utility market. In 2013, the Edison Electric Institute, the trade group for investor-owned electric companies, issued a report warning about disruption.

The convicted bomber's aunt, Maret Tsarnaeva, and two other relatives told Time\u00a0in an interview this week in Chechen capital, Grozny, that they believed he was wrongly convicted as part of a conspiracy by the U.S. The bomber's uncle, Said-Hussein Tsarnaev, told the magazine that 'American special services' orchestrated the 2013 terrorist attack which left three dead and hundreds more wounded. Scroll down for video . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's aunt, Maret Tsarnaeva, claimed in an interview this week that her nephew Dzhokhar (right) had been wrongfully convicted in the Boston bombing as part of a U.S. conspiracy . Martin Richard, who was killed in the bombings, is seen (front circle) just meters away from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (back circle) on April 15, 2013.Seconds later, one of two bombs exploded, piercing his body with shrapnel . The family members could offer no evidence to back up their allegations. Tsarnaev was found guilty by a Boston jury on April 8 of all 30 counts - 17 of them carrying the death penalty - in connection to the deadly April 2013 attacks. The relatives have also attempted to get messages to Tsarnaev, urging him to fire his defense lawyers. However it appears that this request was now at odds with Tsarnaev's mother, who ranted in the wake of his guilty conviction on April 8 that her mass-murderer son is 'the best of the best'. The family is at war over whether to keep the defense team, including attorney Judy Clarke, who were attempting to prevent Tsarnaev being sentenced to the death penalty. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva 'would not listen to reason', the relatives told\u00a0Time. The mother has continued to insist that Dzhokhar and his late brother Tamerlan were innocent, a position she has upheld since the brothers were pinpointed as the perpetrators of the atrocity two years ago. Zealot: Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev's mother, Zubeidat (pictured left in April 2013) sent a text message (right) of support in response to her surviving son's guilty verdict saying America was the real terrorist . A sketch shows Dzhokhar Tsarnaev (second left) and his defense team as the guilty verdicts on all charges against him were read on April 8. The jury will now decide if he gets the death penalty . In a text message to her son's supporter, Timur Rudaev, Mrs Tsarneava called the convicted killer 'my precious boy' before going on a rant against the US. 'America is the real terrorist and everyone knows that,' she wrote in the text, which was later shared on the Russian social media site VKontakte and sent to the news site\u00a0Vocativ. 'My boys are the best of the best,' Mrs Tsarnaev added. She effusively thanked everyone who have been helping her family over the past two years and vowed to keep them in her thoughts. 'May God reward them for supporting my precious boy,' the mother wrote. Rudaev, a resident of Grozny, Chechnya, uploaded Mrs Tsrarnaev's text onto a VKontakte group called Help Dzhokhar Tsrarnaev, which he reportedly launched back in 2013. Zubeidat Tsranaev's statement was accompanied by Rudaev\u2019s rambling rant about Dzhokhar\u2019s guilty verdict in Boston. 'Today, foolish Americans completely shattered the life of a great guy!' Rudaev wrote in Russian. 'But no trial, no jury could trample our opinions, only the Almighty has power over us! Only the Almighty knows the outcome of this trial... we hope the merciful Allah will give Dzhokar a second chance!' Rudaev went on saying that he hopes that in the near future, Zubeidat Tsarnaev, will gather everyone at her home to celebrate Dzhokar's release. 'Everyone will be ruffling his hair and telling him, ''Brother, you persevered, you put the Americans in their place!''' Zubeidat Tsarnaev has been unwavering in her support for Tamerlan, 26, who was killed in a gun battle with police after the bombings, and his younger brother, who was arrested after being cornered inside a boat in a Boston suburb. In the days after the attack, Zubeidat accused law enforcement in Boston of framing her sons and described the scene of carnage at the marathon finish line as a 'really big play\u2019 with 'paint instead of blood.' During a press conference held 10 days after the bombings, the mother was on the verge of hysteria proclaiming she did not accept that her children were responsible for the massacre. \u2018America took my kids away from me. I\u2019m sure my kids were not involved in anything,\u2019 she raved. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev appeared unmoved as the guilty verdict was announced in court last Wednesday. The same jury panel that found him guilty after 12 hours of deliberations will now have to decide whether to sentence Tsarnaev to death or give him life in prison without the possibility of parole.

A community is rallying around a defenceless man who was viciously beaten in a sustained and sickening attack by a gang of thugs - because he's autistic. More than 1,500 people have come out in support of Gareth Blanks after the attack that saw him kicked and punched more than 20 times. Mr Blanks, 31, was walking home after buying a chocolate bar when he was approached by a group of three men and one woman at around 8.30pm on April 17. He was taunted by the group before snatching the hat from his head. When he tried to retrieve the garment, \u00a0he was pushed to the ground, and one of the males punched and kicked him 20 times in the head and across his body. Mr Blanks is now recovering at his home in Truro, Cornwall, but his family say it will take him a long time to recover, and he has been left with deep mental scars. An online support group called Support Gareth, which has already attracted over 1,500 likes on Facebook with several leaving messages of support. His mother, Sandra, 54, who works as a dinner lady  said: 'He's still very distraught, he's shook up and it's going to take him some time before he can go out on his own again. 'They clearly targeted because of his condition. He does look vulnerable and walks around in his own little world. They didn't take anything about from his hat so their intention was clearly just to take the mickey out of him. 'When he came in, he was crying and really upset. 'As a mum, it was horrific to see. I am now just spending all my time trying to get my son sorted out. 'All the support he has got has been a tremendous help and we are so grateful. 'But this will take him a long time to get over. The physical scars will heal a lot quicker than the mental ones.'

Investigation office PC Kim James, from Devon and Cornwall Police, said: 'It was a vicious and unprovoked attack by a female and three males in their late teens or early 20s.' Sergeant Marc Sayers, from Truro police, said: 'This is clearly a cowardly attack on a vulnerably young man going about his normal business. It was almost pack activity. 'We take all attacks extremely seriously but this is exceptional, it was completely unwarranted and unprovoked.

{"question_id": 664, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: EU leaders have agreed a package of measures to tackle the escalating migrant crisis in the Mediterranean \u2013 with pledges to send in warships and triple funding for rescue patrols. After years of dithering, an emergency EU summit yesterday agreed to lay the groundwork for military action against traffickers after the deaths of some 1,700 refugees in the last week alone. Within days, British warship\u00a0HMS Bulwark and the German supply ship Berlin are expected to be sent to the region in the biggest sign of the European Union's belated commitment to the cause. Prime Minister David Cameron, who is two weeks from a national election in which immigration is a major issue, stressed that Britain was not planning to bring any more migrants back to the UK. Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, whose country has been faced with almost daily tragedy as rescuers pluck bodies from the sea, called the EU measures 'a giant step forward.' But other EU leaders were less optimistic, with Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, saying the assets being proposed would 'never be enough' to address the problem. 'A giant step forward': Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi speaks after EU leaders agreed a package of measures to tackle the growing migrant crisis including extra military and a tripling of funding for patrols . Jovial: Danish Prime minister Helle Thorning Schmidt and her British counterpart David Cameron embrace before posing for a family photo during a European Union leaders summit in Brussels . The pledge of resources came as victims of the worst-ever migrant disaster in the Mediterranean were buried Thursday in Malta. Two dozen wooden caskets containing the only bodies recovered from a weekend capsizing off Libya that left at least 800 migrants feared dead were laid out for a memorial service. None of the bodies was identified: One casket had 'No 132' scrawled on it, referring to the number of the DNA sample taken from the corpse in case a relative ever comes to claim it. For several years as death tolls mounted, EU leaders have done little more than deplore the loss of lives and mark tragedies with moments of silence and wreaths instead of fundamental action. When Libya disintegrated politically after the overthrow of longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi and unrest spread in neighboring countries, Europe failed to take forceful action. Yesterday, EU leaders pledged to do more, committing at least nine vessels to monitor the waters for traffickers and intervene in case of need. Other member states, from France to Latvia, also lined up more ships, planes and helicopters that could be used to rescue migrants. The member states agreed to triple funding to \u20ac9million (\u00a37m) a month for the EU's border operation that patrols the Mediterranean. Seek and destroy: Britain will send one of its biggest warships, HMS Bulwark (above), to the Mediterranean within days as part of plans to targets boats used by human traffickers . Escalating crisis: A migrant is stretchered off to hospital by the Italian Red Cross at the port of Salerno after being rescued by the tanker Chimera along with 545 other refugees in the Mediterranean . They also assigned EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini to line up the diplomatic options that would allow EU militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers. Officials said the lack of a strong Libyan government would likely make UN backing necessary. 'Leaders have already pledged significantly greater support, including many more vessels, aircraft and experts' than had been anticipated before the summit, EU President Donald Tusk said. Despite the sudden deluge of goodwill, huge questions remained about whether it would be enough to defeat the smugglers and human traffickers. 'Right now, it's a question of fixing yesterday's errors,' French President Francois Hollande said. He said the EU would hold a summit in Malta with African countries by this summer to see how the continents can work together to better deal with a crisis that has grown dramatically in recent years. In contrast to the Italian premier, the head of another Mediterranean nation on the frontline of the tragedies was far less enthusiastic. For tiny Malta, the smallest EU member state with a population of 450,000, the summit produced nothing particularly new, apart from a fresh resolve to break up the smuggling networks. The assets being proposed 'will never be enough,' Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat said. 'It is definitely not enough if the numbers that are being communicated about prospective migratory flows are anything to go by.' On the offensive: EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini (pictured) has been assigned to line up the diplomatic options that would allow EU militaries to strike against the boats used by traffickers . In the past week alone, more than 10,000 people have been plucked from the seas between Italy and Libya as desperate migrants fleeing war and poverty threw their lot in with smugglers who charged up to $2,000 for a spot on overcrowded boats to make the perilous crossing. At least 1,300 people have died in April alone, putting 2015 on track to be the deadliest year ever. Ending that is Europe's main challenge. Even optimists say any measures agreed at Thursday's summit would not fully stem the tide of unstable ships crossing the Mediterranean. But Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte insisted that Europe should not take the brunt of blame. 'We also ask that Africa, the source of the problem, also collectively takes up its responsibility,' Rutte said. 'Last time I checked Libya was in Africa, not Europe.' German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande arrive at an EU emergency summit in Brussels seeking a solution to the migrants crisis . Over the past year, what little political structure Libya had has collapsed. There are two rival governments, neither with any real authority, and each fighting the other on the ground. Local militias hold sway around the country, some of them with hard-line Islamist ideologies, and the Islamic State group has emerged as a strong and brutal force. The makes any military action against traffickers there even more complicated. 'Any kind of military action can only be based on international law,' said German Chancellor Angela Merkel. 'There are two possibilities: either a U.N. Security Council Resolution or a unity government in Libya. We have neither at the moment.' Europe itself was hardly a picture of unity when it came to the difficult issue of resettling migrants. Countries like Germany, Sweden, France and Italy have dealt with a disproportionate number of asylum requests while many eastern and Baltic member states take hardly any. Five of the 28 member states are handling almost 70 per cent of the migrants coming in. Still, despite the differences, Finland's prime minister Alexander Stubb was hopeful that this time Europe could put up a show of solidarity. 'I hope we'll get it right this time,' he said.\n"]}

The company has struggled for months with the impact of a corruption investigation at state-controlled oil company Petrobras, which undercut the builder's access to financing. A general view of Natal's Dunas Arena during the World Cup match between Italy and Uruguay last year . An economic downturn, government austerity and a slumping currency has also taken its toll, leading to Grupo OAS to announce it is selling its stakes in the stadiums and other businesses to focus on the core construction business. OAS spent 591 million reais (around \u00a3126 million) on completely rebuilding the old Fonte Nova arena in Salvador and 423 million reais (\u00a390 million) on the new Dunas area. The Fonte Nova hosted six games in the 2014 tournament and the Dunas Arena four. The announcement was the latest in a string of bad news for Brazilian football post-World Cup. Holland take on Costa Rica in a World Cup quarter-final at Salvador's Fonte Nova arena last July . Earlier this week Esporte Club Bahia, one of the biggest clubs in Salvador, said they were abandoning plans to use the Fonte Nova because they felt the owners did not respect their fans. Several other stadiums have seen bigger crowds for concerts and religious events than for football and the ground in Cuiaba was closed because of structural problems.\n"]}

The legal adviser to Alison Saunders was a barrister in the same chambers as the son of Lord Janner, it emerged last night. The Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that the Director of Public Prosecutions consulted Neil Moore \u2013 a barrister at 23 Essex Street where Daniel Janner worked \u2013 over whether to prosecute Lord Janner, The Times reported. And senior police officers probing allegations of child abuse offences against the Labour peer have reportedly raised concerns about Mr Moore's involvement in the decision to not proceed with his trial. Last night a CPS spokesman said Mrs Saunders made the decision not to prosecute on her own, and that Mr Moore told her he had been in chambers with Lord Janner's son before discussing the case. He said Mr Moore had acted properly at all times. In a further blow to Mrs Saunders, senior Conservative politican David Davis last night labelled her 'the worst DPP in modern times'. He told The Sun that the treatment of journalists charged with paying public officials was 'heavy-handed and lacking in judgment'. Mrs Saunders said it was her job to make 'very difficult decisions', but the Lord Janner row showed no sign of abating last night. The DPP justified her decision not to prosecute by saying experts agreed Lord Janner, 86, was in poor health due to advanced Alzheimer's disease. But she admitted the former Leicester West MP should have been charged three times before \u2013 in 1991, 2002 and 2007. Mrs Saunders said it was her job to make 'very difficult decisions', but the Lord Janner row showed no sign of abating last night .

Yesterday, calls grew for a judicial review of the decision, which Leicestershire Police said it was considering. Simon Danczuk, the Labour MP who exposed Liberal MP Cyril Smith as a paedophile, said criticism of Mrs Saunders suggested something had 'clearly gone very badly wrong', adding: 'It's hard to see how her position remains tenable.' More questions emerged about Lord Janner's health last night as it was revealed he wrote to the House of Lords a fortnight ago to extend his role.\n"]}

Flight VS44 should have left  McCarran airport at 4.30pm local time on Easter Monday. But a series of delays meant the 403 passengers did not get away on their flight to Gatwick until early on Wednesday. The long delays were too much for some passengers who took to the airport floor to rest . A catalogue of events took place that saw passengers bound for London from Las Vegas delayed by over 33 hours . This shot was snapped by passenger Paul Glogiewicz; the passengers were eventually told there was a problem with the plane's rudder . And now, some passengers are considering legal action against Virgin. Jennifer Glogiewicz, who was travelling with husband Paul and celebrating her 40th birthday, told MailOnline Travel that they were shunted back and forth from the airport to the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel, only to find out each time that there were more delays. 'They just kept telling us the air con wasn't working and plane to warm to board. Then  later they said there was also a rudder issue,' said the mother of two from Bromley. 'The part needed was in the UK and that it would be flown in on tomorrow's inbound Vegas flight, then it would fitted and we would be flown home.' After being seated for two hours on the runway at the culmination of the 33-hour delays, the plane finally set off to the UK at 4am local time. 'We were very worried the entire flight hoping it had been fixed properly. 'Luckily it was a pleasant flight. Every announcement on board began with 'again we apologise'. 'We Landed at Gatwick and were given two letters and \u00a320 per person to spend in M&S; a bit late if you ask me. 'The main point of all our complaints was the lack of communication and awful customer skills of the Virgin Vegas ground staff. The lack of proper communication made the whole thing an absolute nightmare.' Unbelievably some passengers remained in good spirits despite being forced to an unscheduled check-in at the Tropicana Las Vegas hotel . Passenger Charlie Nolan captured this photo of the plane after repairs had been halted because of the winds . Another passenger, Charlie Nolan, claimed that a Virgin employee who was updating the passengers over the tannoy lost his cool when the 400 passengers sarcastically clapped and whooped at the news that the engineers had decided to move the plane to a sheltered area to repair. The wind at the airport had meant the repairs could not be carried out quickly . Nolan told MailOnline Travel that 'another Virgin employee at the gate almost broke down in tears over the tannoy and that 'she claimed she had been working for 48 hours and wanted to go home to her children.' Banker Michael Jazanovich, 30, from Crouch End, north London, who was returning from a stag do, told London's Evening Standard: 'It was an absolute nightmare for everyone involved. The delays were unacceptable and excruciating as they were pushed back and back and people had to sleep in the airport. 'We are expecting a lot more (than \u20ac600). We have lost our time and had an awful experience. 'We deserve a lot more and, by taking a group action, we can work together to get this. We could share a lawyer, we are willing to take it as far as we need to.' They were given hotel accommodation on Monday evening but spent Tuesday night in the airport terminal. Mrs Glogiewicz added: 'I do feel Virgin should just refund everyone their flight cost and be done, not make us all claim. 'This ending has tarnished a great time away with my husband and made me wary of future travel.' Passengers were taken to the Tropicana Las Vegas on numerous times during the long flight delay . Stranded passengers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations over the eventual 33-hour delay . Virgin has said that eligible passengers would be getting EU compensation of \u20ac600 (circa \u00a3434) plus out-of-pocket expenses, but some are demanding much more. A Virgin Atlantic spokesman said: 'We always try our best to get things right for our customers and we are very sorry for the inconvenience caused by the delay of flight VS44 from Las Vegas to London Gatwick on April 6. 'On this occasion, the initial delay was caused by a technical fault with the aircraft and the delay was then extended because of strong winds around the McCarran airport area which hampered our engineers carrying out the repairs. Over 400 passengers endured a nightmare delay to their journey back to the UK from the US . The Virgin Atlantic flight eventually took flight some 33 hours behind schedule after technical problems (file photo) Passengers explained how they had been shipped back and forth to the airport with no solution . 'All of our customers were provided with hotel accommodation and meals while they waited, and we will reimburse them for any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses.

David Cameron ate his hotdog with cutlery as he enjoyed lunch with Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota in the sunshine during a visit to Poole in Dorset . It seems likely that Mr Cameron was trying to avoid the fate of Labour leader Ed Miliband, who was much mocked for his attempt to eat a bacon sandwich on the campaign trail last year . Few people can appear attractive while eating in public, but on the campaign trail a combination of hunger and not wishing to cause offence to hosts means it can be tricky to avoid. Mr Cameron's pitstop at a garden in Poole, Dorset yesterday include a spot of a lunch. The Tory leader loaded his plate with potato salad, cucumber, tomato and a hotdog before settling down next to Lilli Docherty and her daughter Dakota. But he surprised onlookers with his eating style, picking up a knife and fork to chop the hotdog. The PM has a chequered history with hotdogs. In 2010 he caused offence on a visit to New York when he asked for a plain sausage, without even onions. And in March 2012 he was said to have tried eating one sideways while at a basketball game with President Obama. He also sparked a mini-storm after opting for ketchup of mustard, the condiment of choice for many Americans.

The move by prosecutor Javier de Luca to drop the case could mean a definitive end to the accusations that have roiled the nation, according to Argentina's state-run Telam news agency. The case became of high interest globally after the original prosecutor who brought the allegations was found dead in January. Alberto Nisman was found dead days after making the accusations. His death sparked outrage and conspiracy theories aplenty. Nisman alleged that Argentina's government agreed not to go after Iranian suspects in the bombing in exchange for a favorable trade deal. The 1994 bombing of a Jewish community center in the Argentine capital is the deadliest terror attack in the country's history. Eighty-five people were killed, and hundreds were injured. A second prosecutor took the reins after Nisman's death and took the case to court in February. A judge dismissed the case, saying that Nisman's allegations did not hold up. Following that, the case went to prosecutor de Luca for a possible appeal. On Monday, de Luca announced that in his investigation he found that \"there was no crime here, either carried out or attempted,\" according to Telam.\n"]}

Hannah Overton, 37, wiped back tears as she, along with her husband Larry and five children, celebrated news that after having her conviction overturned for poisoning her son, Andrew Burd, with an overdose of salt, prosecutors have dropped all charges against her and will no longer be looking into her case. Throughout her incarceration, her family  stood by her and protested her innocence, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka had said shortly after she was released that he would push again for capital murder charges. He could do this as her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, meaning this would not be a case of double jeopardy. Scroll down for video . Hannah Overton (above wiping away tears with her daughter and son) will not be tried on murder charges again in the death of her adopted son . Overton's five children and husband Larry (above) were there to \u00a0celebrate the news . In a news release however, Skura said that he would not be trying the case again due to 'a myriad of factors which came about after a careful review of the previous trial, re-interviewing some of the key witnesses, consulting with some of the medical experts involved in the case, reviewing evidence adduced at recent hearings and staffing the case with the current prosecutors assigned to the case.' A judge then granted Skura's motion to dismiss. 'Wow, we don't even know where to begin,' Overton said after hearing this news. 'We are so excited about all God has done in and through all of this. He has carried us through.' An appellate court's majority opinion to overturn Overton's conviction last year wrote that her trial was 'problematic from the beginning,' according to ABC News. Original prosecutor Sandra Eastwood was terminated for reasons unrelated to the original case years after Overton was convicted, and Overton has accused her of unprofessional conduct several times since. On a fateful day in October 2006, Burd, whose biological teenage mother was a Meth addict, started acting up and then vomited, telling Overton that he didn't feel well. When he said he felt cold, he took a warm bath but as his symptoms worsened, the Overtons took him to the Corpus Christi hospital for treatment. He died a day later from salt poisoning. A week after his death, murder charges were brought against the mother. The lead prosecutor in the case, Eastwood, portrayed Overton as a frazzled care giver that had force fed Andrew cajun seasoning as a form of punishment, which caused the sodium poisoning. But during the trial, the defense said the boy's death was accidental and was likely due to a medical condition, pica, that can cause a person to crave non-edible salty items like clay, sand or dirt. The mother has been behind bars for seven years, separated from her husband and five children who are being cared for by their father and home schooled by a supportive church community that still believes in Overton's innocence. Late last year her conviction was overturned because of ineffective counsel, but Nueces County district attorney Mark Skurka was set to try her again . Overturned: In September, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned Overton's capital murder conviction in the 2006 salt poisoning death of her 4-year-old foster son, citing ineffective counsel at her 2007 trial for the death of Andrew Burd (right) New details have emerged that allege the prosecutor in the case withheld evidence, like providing details on the boy's stomach content at the time of his death. The defense said that the prosecution claimed that samples from the boy's vomit were unavailable but Overton's lawyers claimed Eastwood withheld evidence so the sample could not be tested. The pediatrician that had treated Andrew before he was placed in Overton's care has also said that the child's medical state was not properly explained at the trial. Dr Edgar Cortes said the boy had development issues that contributed to his eating disorder. 'I think that if we're going to be fair, if we're going to be just, we have to take all of the circumstances into consideration,' he testified at a February hearing, part of Overton's appeal. Teachers and friends who knew the boy have agreed that he had unusual eating habits and even tried to eat trash on one occasion. Andrew died a day after the Overtons took him to the hospital. Prosecutors claimed he died after Overton punished him by making him swallow spicy seasoning. Her defense was that Andrew had very odd eating habits or even an eating disorder called pica . The boy's Sunday School teacher had actually tried to persuade the Overtons not to take Andrew into their care because of his development issues, saying that the parents should think of the welfare of their other children. But the Overtons have said that even knowing what they do now, they would still have welcomed Andrew into their hearts and their home. 'He had brothers and sisters and a mommy and daddy, what he called his forever family, because we had to go through a lot of pain since then,' Hannah Overton told 20/20 in 2008. Eastwood's professional abilities have also been called into question. After the trial she was fired by the district attorney's office in Nueces County in 2010. In 2011, she admitted she struggled with alcohol dependency issues and was also taking diet pills during her tenure as a prosecutor, though she has denied those issues tainted her ability during the Overton trial.\n"]}

A crooked builder befriended a widowed pensioner so he could fritter away her \u00a328,500 life savings on shopping sprees and lavish meals out. Sean Donohoe, 30, from Wilnecote, Tamworth, plundered the elderly woman's accounts before spending tens of thousands of pounds on trips to the Snowdome and in shops such as Argos and HMV. He even persuaded his victim to change her will so he could reap the benefits, before secretly taking out two life insurance policies, both of which named him as the beneficiary. The builder has now been jailed for 21 months after admitting charges of fraud and theft. Sentencing him at Birmingham Crown Court, the judge said Donohoe abused the woman's trust in 'every conceivable way'. Judge Francis Laird QC said: 'You befriended her, you became a close friend and confidante. Because of your behaviour towards her she absolutely trusted you with her financial affairs. 'You abused that trust. You did so in every conceivable way. She effectively handed over her money to you. You were not a financial advisor. 'However she was an elderly lady, a widow, alone and highly vulnerable to a dishonest individual such as yourself.' The court was told how Donohoe had first befriended the woman when he carried out work on her property in Tyseley in 2007. By January 2011, he had started controlling the woman's finances. During that time, he applied for credit cards in her name and also ran up huge debts. The court heard how the victim also changed her will twice during Donohoe's two-year scam, leaving everything to the defendant. But the widow was unaware that Donohoe had taken out the life insurance policies. Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said Donohoe used the money on trips to the Snowdome as well as on meals and at shops. But Department of Work and Pensions checks soon discovered that the woman's accounts were overdrawn, prompting social services to become involved. A judge at Birmingham Crown Court (pictured) said Donohoe abused the woman's trust 'in every conceivable way'. The builder has now been jailed for 21 months, after admitting theft and fraud . It led to Donohoe being arrested. Police found him in possession of four credit cards, as well as a raft of documentation, in the widow's name. In a statement after the case, the victim said: 'I thought he was a good person but I was wrong. As a result of what Sean did to me I was left with no money and worried about paying my bills months after. I am still shocked and upset that he stole thousands of pounds.' Nicholas Berry, defending, said Donohoe was suffering from anxiety and depression after the break-up of a previous relationship and had got into a financial troubles through gambling. 'He was spiralling into debt and owed his father a lot of money. At that time, quite clearly, he saw the opportunity to fleece the victim in an appalling manner,' he said.\n"]}

Bath's qualities are channeled through their attack, with Mike Ford giving the likes of England backs George Ford, Jonathan Joseph and Anthony Watson a licence to play with flair. WEAKNESSES . Poor league form has stunted Leinster's season, with the Dublin side currently fifth in the Pro12 competition after winning just one of their last five fixtures. Bath are short of experience in some key positions, particularly their up and coming backline. DANGERMEN . Leinster: Sean O'Brien Bath: Jonathan Joseph . RECORD .

Saints' Jim Mallinder has one of the most settled groups in the Aviva Premiership, boasting a strong core of squad players who maintain consistently high standards. WEAKNESSES . The Top 14 side were left with a worrying injury list after the Six Nations, with France backs Morgan Parra, Camille Lopez and Wesley Fofana among those missing. Saints try to play on the edge with enforcers such as Dylan Hartley and Calum Clarke, however discipline has previously tipped over the edge in big games. DANGERMEN .

Since relocating to Coventry, Wasps have been driven on by the powerful back row of James Haskell, Ashley Johnson and Nathan Hughes, though Hughes is suspended for kneeing George North in the head. WEAKNESSES . Toulon are in danger of having too many players to choose from, depriving some squad members of the chance to build up consistency.

He was released after posting $2 million bond and surrendering his passport. Zelin said that his next move is to get Dr. Moshetto back to work. \"He's got patients to see. This man, while he was in a detention cell, the only thing that he cared about were his patients. And amazingly, his patients were flooding the office with calls, making sure that he was OK,\" Zelin said. Two other men -- identified as James Chmela, 43, and James Kalamaras, 41 -- were named as accomplices, according to prosecutors. They pleaded not guilty in Nassau County District Court, according to authorities. Both were released on bail. A requests for comment from an attorney representing Chmela was not returned. It's unclear whether Kalamaras has retained an attorney. Police officers allegedly discovered approximately 100 weapons at Moschetto's home, including hand grenades, high-capacity magazines and knives. Many of the weapons were found in a hidden room behind a switch-activated bookshelf, according to prosecutors. The investigation began back in December, when undercover officers began buying heroin and oxycodone pills from Moschetto in what was initially a routine investigation into the sale of prescription drugs, officials said. During the course of the undercover operation, however, Moschetto also sold the officers two semiautomatic assault weapons as well as ammunition, prosecutors said. Moschetto allegedly told officers during one buy that he needed dynamite to \"blow up a building.\" He later said he no longer needed the dynamite because a friend was setting fire to the building instead. Kalamaras and Chmela are believed to have taken part in the arson, according to prosecutors. \"The fire damaged but did not destroy the office of another cardiologist whose relationship with Dr. Moschetto had soured due to a professional dispute,\" according to the statement from the district attorney's office. Moschetto allegedly gave an informant and undercover detective blank prescriptions and cash for the assault and killing of the fellow cardiologist, according to prosecutors. He also requested that the rival's wife be assaulted if she happened to be present, authorities said. \"He was willing to pay $5,000 to have him beaten and put in a hospital for a few months, and then he said he would pay $20,000 to have him killed,\" said Assistant District Attorney Anne Donnelly, according to CNN affiliate WCBS.\n"]}

The fact that the Manhattan DA is 100 percent OK with it is utterly disgusting.' Perez told the newspaper that officers, who arrested him on Monday, had got the wrong Cookie Monster. He said: 'I love people and I love children . . . It could have been anyone else, but not me.' In recent years there has been a rise in the number of people dressing up in costumes as characters from popular television shows in Times Square, leading to calls for them to be regulated and forced to apply for a licence costing $175. In 2012 a man dressed as Elmo was arrested in Times Square following a loud verbal exchange . Rosa Sanchez, 36, pictured here dressed as Elmo, was arrested for aggressive panhandling . Costumed characters are a regular appearance in Times Square, with a number demanding tips . The characters are becoming renowned for causing disturbances in their interaction with members of the public and a crackdown on the issue has been dubbed Operation Sesame Street. Police have recently been distributing flyers reminding people that they do not have to pay to pose with the characters, following a number of incidents. Almost 20 costumed characters were arrested last year for a catalogue of offences. A man who dresses as Elmo from Sesame Street has been arrested several times for disorderly conduct for making anti-semitic remarks to passersby. Last year\u00a0Rosa Sanchez, 36, from New Jersey, was taken into custody Tuesday for allegedly demanding tips in an aggressive manner from passersby while dressed as Elmo. More people are dressing up as the Cookie Monster (left), Woody from Toy Story (centre) and Elmo (right) Also in 2014 a man dressed as Toy Story hero Woody was arrested after he was accused of sexually assaulting a woman by grabbing her buttocks. Several other costumed panhandlers were also arrested - in July, a man dressed as Spider-Man was charged with punching a police officer who intervened in a tipping dispute with a tourist. Three more men dressed as Spider-Man, Iron Man and Elmo were arrested that same weekend and charged with disorderly conduct for obstructing pedestrian traffic. In 2013 a different man dressed as the Cookie Monster was held by police over claims he had shoved a toddler.\n"]}

And using images collected by the spacecraft, Nasa has unveiled an interactive tool that lets you explore this world. Using the map you can see a huge amount of features on Vesta, from craters to the amount of sunlight hitting the surface - and switching to \u20183D mode\u2019 also lets you fly around like you were in your own spacecraft. Called Vesta Trek, the interactive programme lets you explore massive craters on the body - which has no atmosphere, and thus no protection like our own Earth. Vesta, discovered in 1807, is the second most massive body in the asteroid belt after the dwarf planet Ceres - which Dawn has now travelled to. It completes a rotation every five hours and 18 minutes, with a temperature ranging from -3\u00b0C (27\u00b0F) to -188\u00b0C (-306\u00b0F). Some meteorites on Earth have been found to originate from places like Vesta. As you explore the asteroid, you will come across various \u2018troughs\u2019 - areas where the ground sinks away. The largest of these is up to 12 miles (20km) wide and 289 miles (465km) long, similar in size to the Grand Canyon on Earth. Elsehwere there are craters, hills and mountains on the surface, most formed by impacts. On the map you can switch between three main views - over the North Pole, a Global view or looking down onto the South Pole. Various tools also let you find out more information about the asteroid. You can draw lines on the surface to see elevation levels, place a pin to see how the angle of the sun changes at a location over time, or even draw a box to generate files to use with a 3D printer. There\u2019s also an option to 3D print an entire model of Vesta. Nasa scientists in California have revealed an interactive 3D map for Vesta (shown) using images from the Dawn spacecraft. The map lets you see features on the surface including craters, hills, mountains and even 'canyons' You can also measure elevation changes on the surface and see different measurement data. And a 'gaming mode' lets you fly around the largest asteroid in the solar system using your keyboard's arrow keys. In the bottom right of the map is a scale, where you can change the units of measurement by clicking. Aside from using imperial and metric units of measurement - kilometres and miles - it also lets you measure distances in Golden Gate Bridges, football fields and school buses. Various data can also be overlayed on the map, such as the amount of iron or hydrogen in certain regions. The Dawn spacecraft spent a year, from 2011 to 2012, mapping and exploring Vesta. It is so large compared to other asteroids that is sometimes referred to as a minor planet. The spacecraft is now orbiting the dwarf planet Ceres, and over the next few months will be spiraling down closer and closer to image more of it.

The remote community in Aberdeenshire does not even have a shop but local streams have been well known for grains of gold of 'significant size' for decades. Towie has been ignored by investors in favour of the oil industry but a two-year investigation has revealed the possible existence of gold deposits worth millions. A significant deposit is believed by scientists to lie somewhere near Towie which shares its name with the popular\u00a0Essex reality TV show . Sleepy Towie, population 300, has a single road, a few houses, primary school, church, graveyard and a community hall . Turkish mining giant Koza Altin Isletmeleri and a Highland firm GreenOre are now seeking planning permission for further investigation. GreenOre managing director Gavin Berkenheger, 31, said: 'This area in Aberdeenshire has all the right hallmarks of a major deposit to be hiding underneath the surface. 'We looked at the geology and found some really exciting rocks with potential for a large deposit. 'Over two years we have found that the whole of Aberdeenshire is a ripe area for gold mineralisation. We're just trying to locate where the gold deposit is.' He added: 'A 3.5million ounce gold deposit is currently being developed by Dalradian Gold in Northern Ireland. We hope to repeat this success.'

Gold was discovered by Aberdeen University in nearby Rhynie in the 1990s and it has long been spotted in local streams . GreenOre Gold has been working on the site for the last two years and more recently received backing from Koza, controlled by Turkish businessman Hamdi Akin Ipek. They have carried out test drills with more planned, pending pemission. Mr. Berkenheger said the the development of a gold mine was at a very early stage but claimed the area had 'enormous potential'. Panning for gold: Local streams have been well known for grains of gold of 'significant size' for decades . He added: 'We're testing the rock and soil to sample whether it has the potential for gold beneath it. 'We're trying to locate where this deposit will be and we will jump those hurdles when we get there. 'The only way we will know for sure is when we start drilling which we hope to be doing next year. 'Initially we will cover the area with stream sediment sampling - the old-school way. 'Then from the streams with high gold content, we will crack open any rocks we think have the potential of hosting gold. 'The mineral sector has neglected for too long in Scotland because we're so rich with oil and gas but we don't have to be so reliant on that because we're also rich with mineral deposits.' Locals said the prospect of finding gold was 'exciting'. Peter Argyle, local councillor for Aboyne, Upper Deeside and Donside, said: 'Having gold in the area is a very exciting prospect, but it is something that will require a great deal of thought and consultation. 'I'm only just beginning to wrap my head around it. 'At the moment I'm neither jumping up and down or have my head in my hands in dismay. I think we need a lot more information.' Resident Eileen Davies, 79, said: 'We lack population so it could be good for the area. With these kinds of things some people will like it, and some people won't.'

The Frenchman, though, knows he will be up against one of the best defensive midfielders around when the Serb Matic aims to close out another triumph for Jose Mourinho's men. 'What he has done is unbelievable. At Chelsea he is one of the main men, so credit to him. He has had a great season and is a great player. It is always good to play against players like that,' Coquelin said on Arsenal Player. 'It is an important position and Matic has shown how important he is - that is what I am trying to do as well for Arsenal. 'The fans want a good defensive midfielder - they know it is important for the team.' Arsenal will be out to beat Chelsea for the first time since October 2011, when Robin van Persie netted a hat-trick in a remarkable 5-3 victory at Stamford Bridge.

President Barack Obama's spokesman refused to give reporters an update on the status of the meetings or scheduling, saying he would leave those announcements to negotiators. But he confirmed that 'the sense that we have is yes, that the talks continue to be productive and that progress is being made.' Speculation was swirling on Wednesday afternoon that representatives from the six countries, including the U.S., participating in the Switzerland-based discussions with Iran in were on the verge of making a deal as French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius rushed back to Lausanne. Scroll down for video . U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, right, checks his watch outside the Beau Rivage Palace Hotel in a break during Iran nuclear program talks in Lausanne. Six world powers and Iran are still trying to reach a preliminary accord on reining in Tehran's nuclear program, after failing to agree crucial details such as the lifting of U.N. sanctions by a midnight deadline the day before . German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier had said earlier in the day that his French counterpart would come back once the discussions 'enter a decisive stage.' A French official told Reuters Fabius' return should not be interpreted to mean a deal was imminent, however. Already on hand were U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Britain's Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond. A spokesman for Kerry said Wednesday afternoon that the cabinet-level official would remain in Switzerland overnight and indicated that a political 'understanding' with Iran had not yet been reached. Journalists covering the talks in Switzerland were provided with a 'lid,' or promise that no news would be made, until at least the wee hours of Thursday morning, meaning news of a deal, if one is in the works, could come as early as Wednesday evening on the East Coast. The White House's top spokesman Josh Earnest cautiously discussed the ongoing talks as he fielded more than a dozen pointed questions on the subject during his daily briefing Wednesday afternoon. Rotating between tough talk and a soft-handed approach, Earnest said 'the time has come for the Iranian negotiators to begin to make the kind of serious commitments that international community, including the United States, will insist upon. 'While the talks have been productive, we have not yet received the specific tangible commitments that the international community seeks.' Discussions were scheduled to cease at Midnight on Tuesday if Iran was still unwilling to agree to terms set forth by Russia, China, Britain, Germany, the U.S. and France, known globally as the P5+1. The White House had last week said that March 31 was a hard deadline for a preliminary accord, to be formalized by June 30, and that talks had dragged on long enough. As the clocked ticked down, however, it made an about-face and said the U.S. would continue to work toward a deal as long as it felt progress was being made. Earnest said Wednesday that the United States' thinking 'hasn't changed' and it would not 'arbitrarily' or 'abruptly' end talks if it made sense to continue. At the same time, he said, if the U.S. sense that 'the talks have stalled' they, in conjunction with the international community, would walk away. GOOD NEWS ON THE WAY? From left: British Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond, Senior Director at the National Security Council Robert Malley and Kerry chat during a break in discussions . STALL TACTICS:\u00a0President Barack Obama's spokesman, Josh Earnest, refused to give reporters an update on the status of the meetings or scheduling on Wednesday afternoon, saying he would leave those announcements to negotiators . He rejected the notion that the U.S. was giving Iran too much 'leeway' in the talks, telling a reporter, we are 'insisting on a good deal.' A good deal, the White House said said on repeat, is one that would stop Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, and the president will not accept a 'bad deal.' What would happen if an acceptable deal cannot be reached was unclear as the White House was won't to engage in hypothetical scenarios. 'I am at this point reluctant to fast forward to what would happen at the end of the day if an agreement is not reached because they are still discussing an agreement right now as we speak,' Earnest told reporters. If diplomacy, fails, he said that the 'military option' would be considered as would additional sanctions. The White House has resisted bipartisan efforts to put new restrictions on Iran throughout the last several months, saying it would veto sanctions legislation if it came to the president's desk. 'But yeah, if those negotiations break down and the Iranians walk away without demonstrating the willingness to make some serious commitments, then that does bring some of those issues back into play,' Earnest said Wednesday. 'We'll evaluate that when we come to it.' Senators have said they will begin voting on legislation to insert themselves into the process after they return from their Passover-Easter break on April 13 if the White House hasn't sealed a deal. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden, along with the White House's national security team, participate on Tuesday in a secure video teleconference from the Situation Room of the White House with Secretary of State John Kerry, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz and the U.S. team in Lausanne, Switzerland . Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov claimed Wednesday morning that 'ministers have reached a general agreement on all key aspects of a final settlement of this issue.' Asserting that 'it will be put down in writing over the next few hours, maybe during the day, Lavrov added. And Britain's Hammond said, 'I think we have a broad framework of understanding, but there are still some key issues that have to be worked through.' 'Some of them are quite detailed and technical so there is still quite a lot of work to do but we are on it now and we'll keep going at it,' he noted. U.S. diplomats said it was 'not true,' as Lavrov suggested, that key issues had been worked out. The White House's spokesman did not directly deny that an agreement was already being drafted when he spoke to reporters later that day. 'I think I would only point out that there's not a significant difference between those two verbs,' he said after a reporter asked him if talks had moved on from the negotiation stage to the drafting stage. 'It's possible to do both,' he said, playing coy. 'It's possible to negotiate as you draft or to draft as you negotiate.' A source on the ground in Switzerland following the talks told Daily Mail Online that it 'would shock everybody here' if Iran conceded to the international community's demands to significantly scale back its uranium enrichment program and ship out much of what it has already produced because 'there is no indication that the parties have moved.' The source described the situation as a 's***show' at this point and said negotiators are poised to 'limp across' the finish line. 'The Americans desperately needed something to come back to Congress with,' the source said, predicting that the Obama administration will make a 'face-saving concession' that will be announced late tonight or early tomorrow morning. The White House told reporters on Wednesday that whether a pact is made in the end or not, the president will address the public to explain the administration's rationale.\n"]}

Muller-Wohlfahrt claims the German champions' medical department has been blamed for Wednesday night's 3-1 first-leg defeat in Portugal which left their Champions League hopes hanging by a thread. The 72-year-old medical professional, renowned as a world leader in his field, said 'the bond of trust is damaged' and called the blame centred at his department 'inexplicable'. His son Kilian, Peter Ueblacker and Lutz Hansel, who are all part of the team at Bayern, have also resigned. Bayern Munich doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt\u00a0has quit  in the fall-out of their shock defeat by Porto . The 72-year-old is renowned as a world leader in his field and has been at Bayern for almost 40 years . Muller-Wohlfahrt (fourth from left) sits behind Pep Guardiola during the defeat on Wednesday evening . Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt has often courted controversy with his methods. He claims that a substance called Hyalart, which is extracted from the crest of cockerels, helps lubricate knee\u00a0injuries and take away pain. He also swears by Actovegin, an amino acid preparation derived from calves' blood. In 2009, he prescribed more than 50 injections of goat's blood to St Johnstone striker Peter MacDonald for his hamstring injury. Among those to have been treated by him are Ronaldo, Usain Bolt, Michael Owen and Jose Maria Olazabal. Muller-Wohlfahrt claims to have administered more than one million injections, at least half of which have been to athletes. A statement from Muller-Wohlfahrt read: 'After the Champions League match of Bayern Munich against Porto the medical department was for some inexplicable reason made primarily responsible. The bond of trust is damaged.' And on Friday morning, the club released the following statement: 'FC Bayern Munich notes with regret the decision of chief medical officer Dr Hans-Wilhelm M\u00fcller-Wohlfahrt (72) to resign his medical duties at the club. 'Dr Muller-Wohlfahrt in particular, but also his team, have performed first-class work for the club and its players over the years. Our sincere thanks are due for this. 'FC Bayern will shortly announce new arrangements for the club\u2019s medical unit. Until then Dr Volker Braun, sports physician and consulting physician in trauma surgery and orthopaedics, will support the FC Bayern team at matches.' Pep Guardiola had just 14 fit players to choose from at the Estadio do Dragao and the Bayern manager implied in his post-match comments that the defeat was down to the lack of available players. 'We have players who were out a long time with injuries,' he said. 'Their legs don't last very long. It's a tough result to take into the second leg, but we'll give it a go.' Muller-Wohlfahrt comes to Bayern Munich's Arjen Robben during a Bundesliga game last month . Guardiola failed to win the Champions League in his first season in Germany and is on the brink of exit again . Speaking at a press conference on Friday, Guardiola said: 'It was his decision to leave, I respect his decision. That is all.' Guardiola and Muller-Wohlfahrt have reportedly had differences of opinion on several previous occasions including over the fitness of midfielder Thiago Alcantara ahead of last summer's World Cup. Mehdi Benatia, Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben, Javi Martinez and David Alaba were among those missing from the Bayern squad on Wednesday through injury.\u00a0Holger Badstuber and Bastian Schweinsteiger have also struggled with long-term problems. Footage circulating online appears to show Guardiola aiming sarcastic applause at his bench against Bayer Leverkusen last week after centre back Benatia was withdrawn with an injury. Bayern say the announcement was unexpected. Media director\u00a0Markus Horwick said: 'We have no knowledge of this release, so we can not comment.' Usain Bolt was one of many athletes to benefit from Muller-Wohlfahrt's treatment at the London Olympics . Muller-Wohlfahrt has worked with the German national team as well as athletes including Usain Bolt and Boris Becker. The Bayern fall-out will not end his work with Joachim Low's team. 'He is the best doctor in the world,' Bolt said after being treated by Muller-Wohlfahrt at the London Olympics in 2012. 'The Doctor is a very, very great man. Thank you, Doctor!' He previously quit Bayern after falling out with then-coach Jurgen Klinsmann in the 2008-09 season but returned after the manager left. The German champions return to Bundesliga action on Saturday when they face Hoffenheim at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena. Usain Bolt sought the help of Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt in the weeks leading up to the London Olympics in 2012. At the time, Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp recalled his experiences with the doctor. There's not much I have in common with Usain Bolt. He's certainly a little quicker than I was at my peak. But we shared the same doctor when it came to turning to someone in need of urgent repair. When I was a Liverpool player, I regularly used the tricks and skills of Doctor Hans-Wilhelm Muller-Wohlfahrt to rescue me from another injury. Now Bolt, the greatest sprinter of all time, is visiting his Munich clinic to try and be fit for the London Olympics, which start in 18 days. I've read in these pages about Muller-Wolhfahrt's methods being described by a senior figure within the US Anti-Doping Agency as 'Frankensteintype experiments'. I'm not sure what that means, although with me he would use fluid taken from the comb on the head of a hen to lubricate a knee joint that had been eroded by a succession of injuries. He would tell me that it was like 'high quality oil for the engine of a car'. He concluded that the fluid taken from a hen's comb would lubricate the knee and allow greater movement. I was happy to do what he suggested to have the confidence to play again. I've also read about him prescribing goat's blood injections for hamstring injuries. His methods are successful, which is what has drawn Bolt around the world from his Jamaican training camp and why so many go to see the man they call 'healing Hans'. Among the sportsmen and women who have stepped into Muller-Wohlfahrt's dimly lit office are Steven Gerrard, Ronaldo, Jurgen Klinsmann, Dame Kelly Holmes, Paula Radcliffe, Michael Owen, Jose Maria Olazabal and Maurice Green. There is talk of controversy about Muller-Wohlfahrt's methods, but I won't have a bad word said against him. I saw him many times and there was never anything untoward suggested. This is not a back-street quack. He is still Bayern Munich's team doctor, world renowned and a master of his art - and they didn't seem to be doing too badly the last time I watched them in the Champions League Final. Bolt versus his Jamaican training partner, Yohan Blake, is the golden ticket for London. Last weekend, Blake beat Bolt, the fastest man on the planet, in back-to-back races over 100m and 200m. Bolt then withdrew from the Diamond League race in Monaco and the alarm bells are ringing. Nobody wants him to miss these games, surely not even Blake. Athletes generally turn to Muller-Wohlfahrt as a last act of desperation, having exhausted all the local practices and medical skills of those they have been closest to. You can't tell me that Bolt has flown all the way from Jamaica to Munich without trusting Muller-Wohlfahrt's art and without searching for a solution a little closer to home. Like me, he must trust his methods and rely on his advice. He is renowned for helping sportsmen and women, like Bolt, recover from hamstring problems. When I tore a hamstring playing for England, I was out for five months. He is getting sportsmen back on track within five weeks. I only wish I had known about him then. It appears Bolt has a back problem which may have affected his right hamstring. It doesn't sound as if Bolt has suffered a tear, more likely a tweak and if he is unable to trust his hamstrings it might explain why some of his times have been sluggish, by his standards. Didi Hamann, the former German international, first recommended Muller- Wohlfahrt to me when I didn't know where else to turn. I hopped on a plane with the Liverpool physio, hoping we could find some answers. When I first met him, I was anxious, but he made me feel welcome and relaxed. He was in his 60s (he's 70 next month), but he had the skin of a man 20 years younger, with a shock of hair and healthy outlook on life. He believes in the power of positive thinking, he is a charismatic man who convinces you he can find the answers. Most doctors do, but he backs it up with achieving success. His staff are dressed from head to toe in white and he is there, overseeing the treatments and working from 7am-11pm, trying to find the solutions for a conveyor belt of people, including the general public, who come looking for answers. My club, Liverpool, paid for my treatment through insurance, but when I bumped into Hans at a recent Champions League game, he asked me how my knee was and I told him it was still causing me hassle. He told me to come and see him and after some treatment I asked him where I could pay the bill. He said: 'There isn't one, Jamie.' It was a kind gesture from a very skilled man. Bolt is in Safe Hands. Muller-Wohlfahrt has worked with the German national team as well as athletes including Usain Bolt .\n"]}

{"question_id": 694, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)This week, social media heralded as #motheroftheyear Toya Graham, the Baltimore single mom who pulled her son, who was holding a brick, away from the scene of a riot. A video of Graham yanking young Michael from a group of protesters -- and subsequently pummeling him with her fists and a few slaps upside the head -- went viral. Many called her a hero: a mother determined to stop the cycle of violence. And yet, wasn't she also promoting violence? Her own reaction, after all, was to yell, curse and hit. \"Why is America celebrating the beating of a black child?\" asked a writer at The Washington Post. Isn't violence at home what leads to violence outside the home? Isn't this why rioting happens? I'm not excusing violence in any form. I wish it didn't exist. But Baltimore isn't on fire because of mothers like Graham. In fact, what we need, not only in communities like Baltimore but also in communities around the country, are more mothers like her. Mothers who will do whatever it takes to protect their children and steer them through the increasingly tricky course of adolescence. I don't see Graham as an abusive mother spreading the gospel, or at least the inevitability, of violence. I don't see her as a hero, either. What I do see in Graham is a woman who is just like millions of other mothers of adolescents, mothers whose daily struggle is focused on guiding their kids in a positive direction while also helping them develop their own identities and independence. Mothers who know the anger and frustration that can result when they catch their teenager in a lie. As Graham told Anderson Cooper, she'd told Michael the night before not to join in any riots. He swore he wouldn't. But her momma bear sense kicked in, and when she heard that school was closing early, she didn't take the chance that he'd stick to his promise. She went to the site of the riots to make sure that she could help him stay the course. She went there so that she could help him keep his promise. And when she got there and saw he hadn't, as she suspected, she reacted in the way that she knew would, in that moment, be most effective to get him out of there. And that's the key here. It's easy to punish a teenager for acting out, just as it's easy to punish Graham for taking out her frustrations on Michael in a physical way. But Graham's actions are evidence of her commitment as a parent. For better or worse, she knows her son. And she knows her community, and her reality. She knows that she's the mother of an adolescent boy living in a city caught up in a very heated, violent moment. And she will do anything to protect her son, including put herself in a dangerous situation to pull him out of there. Can we all say that? Toya Graham raises an important point that's often missing in the discussions of how to curb violence: Moms have power. The world needs more momma bear types -- mothers who might be willing to put themselves between their child and certain danger. Mothers who are willing to defy the \"expert\" advice telling them that teenagers need the room to make mistakes; that hovering or even trying to anticipate their misbehavior only stunts their development and leads to more misbehavior. Now more than ever, there are exceptions to that rule. Those of us who live in communities that are generally safe can't imagine the level of fear and frustration that must run through the very core of a mother like Graham. We don't all face the same obstacles as the people who live in places like Baltimore. But we all face the same challenges in raising children. Perhaps it's time to recognize that, at least in that sense, we're more alike than we are different.\n"]}

Social media users were left scratching their heads over some of the manipulated snaps being shared during New South Wales\u2019 worst storm in a decade, including an image of a family-sized trampoline caught on power lines. While there were many genuine dramatic photos to emerge from the devastating storm, such as torn up roads and floating houses, not all of them were quite what they seemed. A waterfall gushing over Sydney's iconic Harbour Bridge while two people watched on was just one Photoshop photo to come out of New South Wales' worst storm in a decade . In Lewisham, a suburb in the Inner West of Sydney, an unlikely visitor was spotted in the flood water at the train station . Eagle-eyed Twitter users pointed out that the large trampoline believed to have blown into the sky in the cyclone-strength gusts in NSW was actually a victim of Hurricane Sandy in Milford, Connecticut, USA. The crocodile at the bottom of the steps in Lewisham station was merely an imaginative prank, as was a reused Photoshop snap of sharks swimming at the bottom of a train station escalator. And the video of a wave rider surfing in front of Sydney\u2019s Opera House was nothing but a hoax \u2013 even when it started trending for a second time. The clip was uploaded to Twitter on Tuesday morning by popular Sydney radio duo Fitzy and Wippa, before quickly being reposted by a spell of other sources. A hoax video showing a wave rider surfing in front of the Sydney's Opera House was trending not once but twice . Eagle-eyed Twitter users pointed out that the large trampoline believed to have blown into the sky in the cyclone-strength gusts in NSW was actually a victim of Hurricane Sandy in Milford, Connecticut, USA . The more unbelievable Photoshop jobs included a photo of Noah\u2019s Ark majestically cruising into Sydney Harbour amidst a grey stormy backdrop and a Bondi house with sand pouring through its doors. The Bondi prank came after sand was blown over the famous beachside suburb\u2019s promenade and skate park in real life photos. In other jaw-dropping pictures, the storm water in Sydney\u2019s CBD had submerged the Opera House and knocked over the giant office blocks on the Harbour\u2019s front while a helicopter rescued a person from the flood.

Even Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff suggested Ferrari's success was 'a wake-up call' to his organisation. Without doubt Mercedes responded in the first practice session ahead of the latest race at the Shanghai International Circuit, and none more so than reigning champion Hamilton. A three-times winner at this track, including last season, Hamilton finished 0.541secs clear of team-mate Nico Rosberg, with a best lap of one minute 39.033secs. None of their rivals even came close, with Vettel a further half a second adrift at 1:40.157secs, with his team-mate Kimi Raikkonen 1.6secs down on Hamilton. Valtteri Bottas was ninth in his Williams, over two seconds shy of Hamilton's best time . Jenson Button was within three seconds of Hamilton's lap and 13th in the first practice standings . Fresh from winning in Malaysia, Vettel was best of the rest in Shanghai behind the two Mercedes drivers . To underline Mercedes' supremacy and the gap to Raikkonen, from the Finn in fourth to Force India's Nico Hulkenberg in 18th, there was a difference of just 1.5secs. Behind Mercedes and Ferrari, the best of the rest was Felipe Nasr in his Sauber, with the Brazilian rookie 1.979secs off the pace, whilst Daniel Ricciardo finished 1.996secs down for Red Bull. No other driver came within two seconds of Hamilton, with Daniil Kvyat seventh for Red Bull, followed by Toro Rosso's Carlos Sainz. The Williams duo of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa completed the top 10, 2.27secs adrift and split by a mere one thousandth of a second. As for McLaren, Jenson Button was 13th and Fernando Alonso 17th, with the latter 3.128secs behind Hamilton, with even Jolyon Palmer ahead of him on his debut for Lotus. Last year's GP2 champion, serving as reserve with Lotus this season, was 15th and 2.934secs down, with highly-experienced team-mate Pastor Maldonado only 0.6secs ahead. Manor pair Will Stevens and Roberto Merhi both enjoyed plenty of track time, completing 38 laps between them. For young British rookie Stevens his 18 laps were crucial as he had so far failed to take part in either qualifying session or race in Australia and Malaysia.

True or False, Mercury is: . 1) The planet closest to the sun in our solar system . 2) So hot that water couldn't possibly exist there . 3) Something used in old-style glass thermometers . 4) A planet you don't think about very often . Answers: True, False, True (but not what we're talking about in this story) and I'm guessing No. 4 is true too. If you flunked the test, it might be because Mercury (the planet) suffers from bad (or very little) press. Or, maybe it's just bad lighting. Mercury orbits about 35,983,125 miles from the sun. Compare that to Earth -- we're about 93 million miles from the sun. Mercury's closeness to the sun makes it hard to see except at dawn and twilight. This may be one reason we don't think about it much. Venus, on the other hand, the planet between Earth and Mercury, appears to be the brightest planet in the sky. It's so bright it's been mistaken for an airplane. Pilot sends plane into dive after mistaking Venus for oncoming plane . But back to Mercury. It's getting some attention from the media now because it's about to get a visitor. The NASA spacecraft MESSENGER (an acronym for MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) is about to crash onto Mercury. The probe was launched in 2004 and traveled more than six and a half years before it started orbiting Mercury on March 18, 2011. Now, MESSENGER is running out of fuel and NASA says it will hit the planet's surface at 8,750 mph (3.91 kilometers per second) around April 30. You won't be able to see it hit because Messenger will crash on the side of Mercury facing away from Earth. There's no way to save the spacecraft, but mission operators at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Maryland, have been doing what they can to delay the inevitable. They've been using the little bit of fuel left on board to maneuver the spacecraft to keep it in orbit. They'll do one final maneuver on Friday, April 24. \"Following this last maneuver, we will finally declare the spacecraft out of propellant, as this maneuver will deplete nearly all of our remaining helium gas,\" mission systems engineer Daniel O'Shaughnessy said at a recent media briefing. \"At that point, the spacecraft will no longer be capable of fighting the downward push of the sun's gravity.\" But rather than mourn the loss, scientists held a briefing to celebrate the mission's success. \"For the first time in history we now have real knowledge about the planet Mercury that shows it to be a fascinating world as part of our diverse solar system,\" said John Grunsfeld, associate administrator for the Science Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. One of MESSENGER's big findings: It sent back data indicating that ice in Mercury's shadowed polar regions, if spread over an area the size of Washington, would be more than two miles thick, NASA said. It also took some amazing photos of the planet. So the MESSENGER mission is ending, but scientists say they'll be busy for years studying data from the probe. And if you want to see Mercury with your own eyes, you may be in luck if you can find an area with dark skies. It will be visible in the night sky just before dusk until about the end of May.

{"question_id": 698, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Keith Anderson attacked two men who he asked for a cigarette last year. He left one, an Army Lance Corporal, in a coma and severely brain damaged . A violent thug who ended a soldier's career with one punch because he wasn't given a cigarette has been jailed for seven years. Lance Corporal Albert Duffy had survived bomb blasts during a glittering military career which saw him complete three tours of war-ravaged Afghanistan. But after returning home to the UK, he was attacked at a bus stop by drink and drug-crazed Keith Anderson and left with severe brain damage. Just minutes before the attack, Anderson had punched another man, injuring him and leaving him incapable of work for a month. The 28-year-old thug 'bounced around, triumphantly like a boxer' after the assaults, a court heard this week. A judge was told the soldier had high hopes of progressing through the ranks, but is now unlikely to return to the military. Jailing Anderson for seven years at Teesside Crown Court this week, Recorder Patrick Palmer said: 'Albert Duffy was enjoying his career in the army. 'He was doing his bit for the United Kingdom and served abroad and served in combat and it seems highly unlikely he will return to his career. Your one punch destroyed that.' The court heard Anderson first attacked Adam Crosby at a bus stop in Hartlepool town centre on July 26 last year. He was angered that he only offered him the remainder of the cigarette he was smoking. Mr Crosby had to take a month off work at his family firm after he was left with a fractured cheek bone and damage to his teeth and nose. Anderson then walked to a nearby bus stop where L/Cpl Duffy was waiting and punched him to the ground after he failed to produce a cigarette. The soldier was left him slumped on the ground, bleeding from his ears and in a coma for 14 days. He sustained a fractured skull and needed two rounds of surgery after suffering haemorrhages, with part of his brain being removed. L/Cpl Duffy, from Darlington, County Durham, was a member of the 3 Rifles Infantry Battalion and had served in the Army for more than ten years, seeing colleagues killed and injured in Afghanistan. Teesside Crown Court heard\u00a0Lance Corporal Albert Duffy's military career had been ruined by the attack . He escaped with his life in 2009 after a vehicle he was in hit an improvised explosive device. He was blown 15 feet into the air, but suffered only a broken foot. Since the attack, he has gone from one of the fittest in his battalion to a man who struggles to put together sentences, the court heard. He also has hearing problems and has little short-term memory, the judge was told. His mother, Marie Briggs, says she no longer recognises him as the caring son once looked up to by his seven siblings and her three-step children. In a statement to the court, L/Cpl Duffy said: 'I don't know what I'll do if I don't have the Army in my life and I have fought for my country. 'I find it difficult to comprehend how my life has been ruined by a male from Hartlepool, who punched me for no reason.' Fellow-victim Mr Crosby told the court: 'I'm 25, I should be enjoying myself, but this attack has had a massive affect on me.' Robin Turton, prosecuting, said when Anderson was arrested on July 30, he asked police: 'Is that me you're looking for in the paper' after seeing headlines as officers appealed for help. He also asked about the condition of one of the victims, but made no comment when he was interviewed. L/Cpl Duffy and the other victim, Adam Crosby, were set upon at a bus stop in Hartlepool in July last year . Mr Crosby's blood was found on clothing seized from Anderson's home in Hartlepool. Anderson admitted grievous bodily harm against Mr Crosby and grievous bodily harm with intent for the attack on L/Cpl Duffy. He was sentenced to two years for the attack on Mr Crosby and seven for the assault on L/Clp Duffy to run concurrently. Neil Mullarkey, mitigating, said Anderson had started to tackle his drink problem since he was remanded in custody. He added: 'He is disgusted with himself and thinks about what he has done every day and is ashamed.' The court heard that Anderson already has 19 convictions for 39 offences, including punching and head butting two women in a takeaway and an assault in which he used a pool ball in a sock to attack a man in a pub. But Recorder Mr Palmer stopped short of classifying him as a 'dangerous offender', which would have allowed the judge to jail Anderson indefinitely.\n"]}

The first eruption in over four decades\u00a0yesterday sent vast clouds of dust more than six miles into the air, creating an incredible display of lightning and lava against the\u00a0night's sky. Another unexpected eruption in the Los Lagos Region today heightened fears of local waters becoming contaminated, residents developing severe breathing problems and more flights being grounded. The ash covered cars and houses in cities as far as 18 miles away from the source of the eruption as another massive evacuation effort gets underway. Previous and equally violent eruptions at Calbuco have continued for up to a week, according to a volcanologist from Oxford University who told MailOnline it is impossible to predict what will happen next. The volcano is one of the most dangerous of Chile's 90 active volcanoes but was not under any special observation before it suddenly sprung into life at around 6pm local time yesterday. Emergency officials were taken by surprise and had only a few minutes to issue an alert. Scroll down for video . Ghost town: Most people have abandoned the La Ensenada locality in Puerto Varas (pictured) which has been caked in ash despite being over 18 miles away from the massive eruption at Calbuco volcano . Scared: A 30-year-old from Puerto Varas (pictured) said she saw 'the column of smoke rising up' from the volcano when she looked out of her window' Aftermath: The two violent explosions shot billions of cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere, caking nearby localities like La Ensenada in mounds of abrasive soot . Colossal: Two massive explosions from Calbuco volcano in southern Chile have shot up to ten billion cubic metres of ash over six miles into the atmosphere (pictured) Dangerous: Many people in Puerto Varas (pictured) have become worried about the damage the ash will cause to their health . Stuck: As tractors try to clear the mounds of ash that have blocked the roads, one local said: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared... We have a layer of smoke above us' Contaminated: Ash from the second blast seriously impared the visibility of drivers fleeing the city of La Ensenada (pictured) near the volcano . Isolated: A masked and hooded woman stands alone among the ash falling in the San Marin de Los Andes area near Calbuco . Evacuation: Thousands have fled their homes after Calbuco erupted unexpectedly on Wednesday and was still pouring ash into the sky on Thursday . Explosion: A second eruption from the Calbuco volcano in Chile (pictured) has forced over 4,000 people to abandoned their homes and covered nearby communities in ash . Dramatic: 4,000 people were evacuated from cities around Calbuco following a second spectacular and frightening eruption today (pictured) Eruption: Residents of Puerto Montt had a clear view of the first terrifying explosion yesterday (pictured) which threw ash and smoke a staggering six miles into the air . Spectacle: The dense ash cloud from Calbuco today created an incredible display of lightning and lava against the night sky . Local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano which lies near the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt - 620 miles south of the capital Santiago. Even Professor David Pyle who has studied over a century of eruptions across Chile's 1000-mile stretch of volcanoes ranks this one  among the strongest - and claims its ash could cross the Pacific to Australia. He ranked this particular explosion 'a three or four' on the Volcanic Explosivity Index which means it could unleash an astonishing ten billion cubic metres of ash into the atmosphere. Professor Pyle told MailOnline: 'Based on a 15km-high plume and an eruption of around an hour and a half, that\u2019s quite strong. This particular volcano has erupted a number of times over the last hundred years. 'Sometimes it has lasted a day and other times it has bubbled on for a few weeks. The activity\u2019s died down for the moment but we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen next.' Many people in Chile are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health, adding: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us.' A 30-year-old from Puerto Varas admitted many people in Chile are deeply concerned about the harmful effects on their health, adding: 'We woke up today with a blanket of fog and it hasn't cleared. We have a layer of smoke above us.' 'People went into a state of panic' as the ash cloud spread, according to Miguel Diaz who lives in Puerto Montt 14 miles away. He added: 'I heard a loud noise as if somebody had detonated an atomic bomb.' Abandoned:\u00a0Chile's President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured since the first explosion yesterday .

Covered: Resident of the Ensenada locality (pictured) near Calbuco struggled to clear the mountains of ash that had built up on their rooves . Locked out: Local authorities have evacuated 4,000 people away from the gas and ash contaminating the air and closed access to the area around the volcano . Protection: Even residents in the Argentinian city of\u00a0San Carlos de Bariloche (pictured) donned gas masks to avoid the respiratory damage caused by the ash from Calbuco . Deadly: Smoke and lava spew from the Calbuco volcano, as seen from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas which is over 18 miles away . 'Even small amounts of ash can be really quite disruptive,' according to Professor Pyle who added: 'It affects power supplies and it can be disruptive to agriculture. You don\u2019t need particularly thick accumulations of ash to start to have physical consequences.' Chile's President Michelle Bachelet has declared a state of emergency even though no one is believed to be injured and the only person who went missing since the first explosion was found on Thursday. She said this eruption at Calbuco is 'more serious and unpredictable' than that of the Villarica volcano which also forced the evacuation of thousands of people. The director of a radio station in Puerto Montt described how hundreds of locals rushed to get gas following the eruption, forcing stations to ration their sales. And supermarkets closed their doors to avoid being looted. LATAM airlines has cancelled flights to and from Puerto Montt because airborne ash can severely damage jet engines. A volcano in the Caulle Cordon of southern Chile erupted violently in 2011, forcing the cancellation of hundreds of flights and the evacuation of more than 3,500 people. Stiff winds blew the ash from that explosion over the border to Argentina where the thick, abrasive soot coated slopes in the sky resort city of San Carlos de Bariloche. And by Thursday afternoon, much ash had made its way to Villa La Angostura, Argentina, a small town about 56 miles (90 kilometers) northeast of the volcano. Cars and streets were coated with a thin layer of ash, but people were otherwise going about their business. 'We are praying that the volcanic activity will be as short as possible,' said mayor Roberto Cacault. The National Mining and Geology Service issued a high alert on Wednesday and set up an exclusion zone of 12 miles around the volcano. Ominous: The first eruption (pictured) sent a huge plume of gas and ash soaring into the atmosphere which was visible from up to 100 miles away . Active: Calbuco (pictured yesterday) is one of Chile's three most dangerous volcanoes and part of an active chain of around 500 that cover the south of the country . Incredible: Smoke and lava shot out of Calbuco yesterday as people watched on from the shores of Lake Llanquihue in Puerto Varas (pictured) Explosion: Residents in nearby Puerto Varas (pictured) went about their business as Calbuco exploded, but local authorities setting up a 12.5-mile exclusion zone around it . Destructive: Volcanoes like Calbuco (pictured) occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust . Plume: While most people think of volcanoes as spewing lava, many eruptions take the form of super-heated gas and ash (pictured) which is pushed through the earth's crust, covering the sky . Trevor Moffat who lives in Ensenada - some six miles from the volcano - said the eruption yesterday happened without warning. Volcano Calbuco's last major eruption happened in 1961, with a weak eruption following in 1972. He said: 'It sounded like a big tractor trailer passing by the road, rattling and shaking, guttural rumbling ... we left everything there, grabbed my kid, my dog, got in the car with my wife. Mr Moffat, who was originally born in Canada, said he was now driving his family to Puerto Varas. He added: 'All the neighbors were outside, a lot of young people crying. Armageddon type reaction.' Television pictures showed a spectacular mushroom-shaped column billowing into the sky with occasional lighting bolts shooting through it. The eruption was seen up to 100 miles away in neighbouring Argentina. Derek Way, a resident of Puerto Varas, said: 'There are a lot of people out in the streets, many heading to the gas stations to fill up on gas. A friend told me to fill everything we have with water.' Chile, on the Pacific 'Rim of Fire', has the second largest chain of volcanoes in the world after Indonesia, including around 500 that are potentially active. In March, volcano Villarrica, also in southern Chile, erupted in spectacular fashion, sending a plume of ash and lava high into the sky, but quickly subsided. Volcanoes occur at the edges of tectonic plates which make up the earth's crust, either where these plates are moving toward or away from one another. Eruptions occur when magma from the Earth's core forces its way to the surface, exploding through weak points in the crust. Danger: Residents from nearby towns said people were crying in the streets after the volcano erupted without warning at 6pm local time . Shocking: While the first eruption occurred in the middle of the afternoon, the plume of ash and smoke was visible well into the evening from towns 100 miles away in Argentina . Blanket: The last major eruption here was in 1961 when lava flows filled the top crater before spilling down the sides and into a nearby lake . Distant: A view of the ash cloud from the Nahuel Huapi lake, around 100 miles away from the volcano in neighbouring Argentina .\n"]}

Noise-induced hearing loss is\u00a0one of the most common work-related illnesses and members of the armed forces are\u00a0particularly vulnerable. In 2013, the US Department of Veterans Affairs reported hearing loss as one of the most common ailments among veterans receiving disability compensation. Noise-induced hearing loss is one of the most common work-related illnesses, doctors have warned . Now, however, scientists at the University of Southern California believe they have made a breakthrough in their understanding of the condition. They have identified a gene, named Nox3, found in the inner ear, that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss. Their research, looking at the DNA of mice exposed to noise, is the first published genome-wide association study on noise-induced hearing loss in mice. As a result of the findings, those at higher, genetic risk for hearing loss can decide whether to take precautionary measures to protect their hearing prior to hazardous noise exposure, the study authors say. 'Understanding the biological processes that affect susceptibility to hearing loss due to loud noise exposure is an important factor in reducing the risk,' said lead study author Professor Rick Friedman. 'We have made great advances in hearing restoration, but nothing can compare to protecting the hearing you have and preventing hearing loss in the first place.' Scientists have identified a gene, named Nox3, found in the inner ear, that is crucial in determining how vulnerable a person is to developing hearing loss . While some gene association studies on noise-induced hearing loss in people have been conducted in the past, all were very small and their results unreplicated. Genome wide association studies search the entire DNA for common mutations to see if any of those are linked with a trait. Mouse genome wide association studies have lead to the discovery of hundreds of genes involved in complex traits that have immediate relevance to people. The study was published in the journal PLOS Genetics. An earlier version of this piece existed but has now been amended.\n"]}

Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, found the 3.69-carat white diamond in a 37.5-acre search field on Thursday, her last day of a trip to the park with her husband. Clark, who first visited the park 33 years ago with her mother and grandmother, prayed to God, asking, 'Are you doing to bless me and let me find a diamond today?' as she searched the field. Susie Clark, of Evening Shade, Arkansas, found a 3.69-carat white diamond on a search field at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Arkansas . Clark named the pinto-bean-sized, teardrop-shaped gem a 'hallelujah diamond' because she spotted the gem shortly after praying that she would find something . And shortly after praying, Clark said she spotted the diamond sticking out of a ridge of plowed dirt, according to Region 8. She named the teardrop-shaped diamond the Hallelujah Diamond, claiming that her prayer helped her find the gem. Clark plans to keep the pinto-sized diamond, which is the largest diamond of the 122 found in the park this year. Crater of Diamonds State Park holds the only diamond-bearing site accessible to the public, in the form of a large plowed search field. 'The gem is frosted white with a pearlescent metallic shine,' park interpreter Waymon Cox told Region 8. 'It's the largest one found since April 16, 2014.' The search field had just been plowed earlier in the week because the park had seen a lot of rain, Cox said. 'This regular endeavor loosens the diamond-bearing soil which, along with rain erosion, brings more diamonds to the surface and helps park visitors' chances of finding them,' he said. Cox added: 'With all the rain we've been seeing, along with this week's plowing, there's a good chance more diamonds will be found on the surface in the days to come.'

News of the royal delivery will then also be posted on the traditional easel behind the gates of Buckingham Palace, just like Prince George and Prince William before him - or her.

When Prince George was born in July 2013 his birth was first announced to journalists in an emailed press release. A formal notice signed by the doctors who delivered him was then taken by police escort to Buckingham Palace  and displayed at the gates to retain 'the theatre' of a genuine royal occasion. A palace spokesman said at the time: 'We wanted to retain some of the theatre of the notice. It is quite important to us that this is done properly and with the degree of dignity that the event demands. This is the birth of a child who will be in line to the throne. It is a rare occasion and it is nice to be able to do it with some historical precedence.' Clarence House also tweeted the news, and the British Monarchy's Facebook page was also updated. Royal sources say the only difference between the birth of Prince George and his brother or sister will be that there will be less ceremony around the delivery of the piece of paper from the Lindo Wing of St Mary's to Buckingham Palace. The signed document is expected to be taken out of a side door and delivered to the palace in an unmarked vehicle. And it's not the first time the Duke and Duchess have chosen Twitter to deliver news. When the couple got engaged in October 2010 the announcement was first made on Twitter the following month. The birth of Prince William was first announced on an easel outside Buckingham Palace in 1982 . Prince William's birth announcement was signed by the doctors who delivered him . With the Duchess due to give birth any day, one gambler has bet \u00a310,000 that she will give birth to a girl. The man, in his late 30s and from Manchester, will collect more than \u00a315,000 in winnings, which includes his original bet, if the royal baby is a princess. Bookmakers Ladbrokes said the anonymous punter normally gambles on horse racing and football, and this is his first bet on the Royal Family. The Duchess in March at one of her last public appearances before the birth of her new baby . The man said: 'I'm not really bothered by the royals, but I'd just had a big win and my missus reckons it's a girl, so that's a good enough reason for me.' Ladbrokes set the odds of the baby being a girl at 8/15 and 11/8 for a boy. William and Kate's fourth wedding anniversary on Wednesday April 29 is now one of the favourite arrival dates at 4/1. Alice remains the favourite girls' name at 5/4, while Charlotte is 5/1. Arthur is the favourite boys' name at 12/1 and James has odds of 20/1. As the wait for the royal baby continues, Prince Harry has a rapidly reducing window of opportunity to meet his new niece or nephew before he returns overseas. He flew back to the UK to attend the London Marathon after commemorating the centenary of the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey. He chatted to St John Ambulance volunteers and handed out medals to winners of the elite races. Harry is scheduled to return to Australia tomorrow. David Cameron has defended William and Kate for opting to use private health services rather than the NHS. Asked if he was disappointed the Royal Family did not use the NHS, Mr Cameron told Murnaghan on Sky News today: 'I think it's a total matter of choice for people - what they use and where they have their babies. 'All I hope and pray for is there'll be happy, healthy news for that wonderful couple and for the whole country.' He added: 'The NHS is superb and I've seen that in my own life in so many different ways but I believe in choice, I believe in people being able to do what they want to do, and as I say I've only got one thought about the royal baby which is a happy and healthy arrival.' The baby will officially be overdue if Kate has not given birth by May 1, and even Kate herself has said the baby is due mid to late April. Parking restrictions outside the Lindo Wing run out after April 30. Some believe labour is influenced by the lunar cycle and the arrival of a full moon, and the next full moon is on May 4. The suggestion is that the moon's gravitational pull affects the amniotic fluid in the same way it affects the water in the sea and rivers.

The country joined several of its South American neighbors in allowing the unions when President Michelle Bachelet enacted a new law on Monday. \"This is a concrete step in the drive to end the difference between homosexual and heterosexual couples,\" Bachelet said. The new law will take effect in six months. It will give legal weight to cohabiting relationships between two people of the same sex and between a man and a woman. The Chilean government estimates that around 2 million people will be able to benefit from the change. The law is intended to end discrimination faced by common-law couples, such as not being allowed to visit partners in hospital, make medical decisions on their behalf or decide what to do with their remains. It also gives the couples greater rights in the realms of property, health care, pensions and inheritance.

Nigel Farage today insisted the Tories had suffered a 'hammer blow' after a former parliamentary candidate defected to Ukip - only for it later to emerge that he had already been sacked from the party last week. Mike Whitehead, who was standing against Labour's Alan Johnson for the Tories in Hull, claimed he was joining Ukip after becoming 'disgusted' at the behaviour of the ruling Conservative group in his area. But the Tories this morning revealed they had already dropped Mr Whitehead as their candidate  after he revealed he was planning to stand as an independent against a Tory councillor. A spokesman for the Tories said: 'This man is not our candidate for Hull West and Hessle. He was sacked last week. 'We wrote to him last week to say that his position was untenable and could not stand for us at the General Election. We were already selecting a new candidate for this constituency. This is typical Ukip \u2013 cynical, misleading and utterly calculating to try and score political points.' Mr Whitehead, speaking on BBC 5 Live this morning, confirmed he was sacked last week. He said: 'I got an email on Wednesday evening to say that if I didn't stand aside from my intentions to stand in the local elections, they would remove my candidacy in West Hull and Hessle. 'I said I wasn't prepared to do that and so as I wouldn't give them that guarantee they terminated my candidacy in West Hull & Hessle.' Mr Whitehead said he had been increasingly worried about the behaviour of the controlling group of Tories in East Yorkshire since 2011, when seven Conservative councillors from Haltemprice and Howden resigned, citing bullying and intimidation. He added: 'In my opinion, the behaviour of the ruling group has only gotten worse since then.' Mr Whitehead said he could no longer carry on 'in good conscience'. Scroll down for video . Responding to the news, Mr Farage said: 'I am delighted to be welcoming Mike to the party at this exciting time.

{"question_id": 706, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Rome (CNN)A destination for the destitute, Sicily is the \"promised land\" for thousands of migrants and refugees making the desperate journey from North Africa to Europe's Mediterranean coast. More than 10,000 people have arrived from Libya since last weekend alone, according to the Italian Coast Guard. Stories of death at sea and unimaginable suffering are nothing new in the waters between North Africa and Italy; boat people have been arriving on Italy's islands for more than a decade. But what makes the current influx different is the increase in numbers and the absence of control from the ports of embarkation, specifically those in Libya, because when Moammar Gadhafi was in control, he also controlled the flow of migrant ships. In 2008, the-then Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi and Gadhafi  signed an historic friendship agreement in which Italy promised to invest $5 billion in Libyan infrastructure and Gadhafi promised to close what he described as a \"spigot\" of migrants. During a three-day state visit to Italy in August 2010, he famously threatened to \"turn Europe black\" if Libya did not enjoy cordial relations with the European Union. After the agreement, Gadhafi  kept his promise and the number of arrivals drastically decreased. For a time, almost all migrant arrivals came from Tunisia, just 70 miles from the Italian island of Lampedusa. Because Italy sent most of those migrants who did not qualify for political asylum back to Tunisia, the flow eventually tapered off. And once a new Tunisian government was in place, after the Arab Spring, Italy signed an accord with Tunisia in which they promised to help patrol Tunisia's ports. But after Gadhafi was overthrown, the flow of migrants from Libya exploded again: the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in Rome told CNN that more than 140,000 migrants arrived from the North Africa coast in 2011. In October 2013, after a tragic boat accident off the coast of Lampedusa in which 349 people -- including an infant still attached to its mother by the umbilical cord -- died, trapped like sardines in their smugglers' boat as it sank, Italy decided it had to act. In November of 2013, the Italian Navy launched a \u20ac9M-a-month search-and-rescue program called Mare Nostrum, in which Italian naval ships patrolled the seas to rescue migrants. In just one year, the program rescued more than 160,000 migrants, according to the Italian Navy. Due to budget constraints and criticism from the European Union that the program itself was encouraging migrants to head across the Mediterranean, the mission ended in October 2014. By the end of the year, more than 174,000 people had been rescued in Italy; an estimated 3,072 people died making the journey, according to the IOM. In November last year, the European Union's border control, Frontex, started its own mission -- Triton -- with a budget of less than a third that of Mare Nostrum. Frontex has no vessels or surveillance equipment of its own, so has to rely on European member states to lend them ships; a ship from Iceland, at the far north of the continent, is currently involved in Frontex's operations off southern Europe. When Italy ended Mare Nostrum, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Antonio Guterres warned that some European governments were making \"keeping foreigners out a higher priority than upholding asylum standards.\" \"This is a mistake, and precisely the wrong reaction for an era in which record numbers of people are fleeing wars,\" Guterres told a UNHCR policy meeting. \"Security and immigration management are concerns for any country, but policies must be designed in a way that human lives do not end up becoming collateral damage.\" Once migrants arrive in Italy, they are supposed to be processed for political asylum and monitored until it is granted or denied, but Italy has been sanctioned by the European Union for not fingerprinting new arrivals. By law, Italy has to take care of the arrivals, but many have no intention of staying in the country, and few of the reception centers are gated, meaning migrants can come and go as they please. And with no physical border controls between Italy and other European countries, they can then disperse across the continent. Moutassem Yazbek, 27, an IT specialist who worked for six years in Dubai, arrived in Sicily in December on board a smuggler's boat. He told CNN he was never fingerprinted in Italy, and eventually made it to Germany where he is studying to learn the language and find work. He says the human trafficking network is a finely-oiled machine that fills a growing need. \"I would have done anything to get here,\" Yazbek said. \"It was worth the risk, the bad treatment and the fear. Hard as that may be to believe, it is a better life.\"\n"]}

Tykeran Hamilton, 25, who borrowed the rented black BMW 3 Series and drove it around Gloucester after spending a night drinking and taking drugs,\u00a0has been jailed for 11 years. He spotted a friend waiting for a bus, leaned out of the window and shouted 'watch this' before accelerating up to 70mph on a residential road at 7am. Bristol Crown Court heard Hamilton sped down the road and overtook cars 'recklessly' - narrowly avoiding a central reservation and other traffic. Moments later, he crashed into cyclist Alan Knight, 64, who was crossing the road while on his morning paper round, then drove away at high speed. Former factory worker Mr Knight, a father-of-four and grandfather-of-14, died instantly from his injuries at the scene, on Stroud Road in Gloucester. Hamilton abandoned the car nearby then fled the city and denied any involvement in the tragedy, which happened on September 26 last year. His trial was due to start today but he admitted causing death by dangerous driving, driving without a license, driving without insurance and failing to stop after a road accident. Judge Graham Cottle said Hamilton 'could not have cared less' about the safety of others on the road when he hit Mr Knight. 'In the early hours of the morning of September 26 Mr Knight was doing a paper round on his bicycle,' the judge told Hamilton. 'What had you been doing for the past 12 hours? The evidence paints a picture of you spending a night drinking, taking cocaine. 'You were an uninsured driver, you were unlicensed. You went to a garage and as it happened you saw somebody nearby who you knew. 'You said \"watch this\". The inference that can be drawn from that statement is that you attempted to show off to him what this car could do. 'You took off up the road at around 60-70mph. You were overtaking recklessly and just managed to avoid colliding with a central island.' Great-grandfather Alan Knight, 64, had been out on his morning paper round when Hamilton crashed into him. Mr Knight was killed instantly. His wife said: 'My life just isn't the same since he was taken from us' Hamilton spotted Mr Knight starting to cross the road ahead and immediately began braking but could not stop, the court heard. 'You drove straight into Mr Knight, doubtless killing him instantly,' the judge said. 'You left him in the road and you drove off at equally high speed.' Hamilton drove back to a friend's house before running to see his girlfriend, who he asked to provide him with an alibi, then left Gloucester. The court heard Hamilton told friends 'I've licked him, I've licked him' - street slang for 'I've killed him'. He was arrested on October 21 but insisted he was not involved, telling police he had been with his sister and girlfriend at the time. Prosecuting, Rupert Lowe read a victim impact statement from Mr Knight's wife, Linda. Mr Knight was struck on Stroud Road, Gloucester (pictured) on the morning of September 26 last year . 'My life just isn't the same since he was taken from us by such a show-off person like you, Mr Hamilton,' it said. 'Alan was a great husband, father and grandfather. We didn't want for anything. If we needed the moon he would get us the stars as well.' Mr Knight started doing paper rounds on his bike four years before the accident and did it as a hobby to keep fit. His daughter Victoria told Hamilton in court: 'I will never forgive you for what you did that day and I hate you for it. You are heartless.' The judge sentenced Hamilton for 10 years for causing death by dangerous driving, driving without insurance, driving without a license and failing to stop. He imposed a separate sentence of 12 months, to run after the first sentence, for five drugs charges relating to possession with intent to supply Class B drugs. Hamilton had been on license for the charges at the time he killed Mr Knight. Representing Hamilton, of Moor Street, Gloucester, Joe Maloney, said: 'He is an immature man. He panicked, drove off and did all the wrong things.'

But the evidence will never be tested in court after Alison Saunders, Director of Public Prosecutions, ruled that it was not in the public interest to put the Labour peer on trial because of his age and ill health. Janner, 86, is a father of three. His youngest daughter, Laura Janner-Klausner, 51, is an ordained rabbi and serves as senior rabbi at the Movement for Reform Judaism. His son Daniel Janner is a prominent QC. Janner\u2019s wife Myra died in 1996 and he has not been seen outside his flat in Hampstead, north-west London, since police investigating the claims of historic sexual abuse raided it in 2013. Shortly afterwards, reports emerged that he was suffering from advanced dementia. In the month before the raid, Janner attended the Lords 15 times, claiming \u00a32,100 in daily allowances, which has inevitably cast a critical spotlight on the decision to not prosecute him. Janner, it should be stressed, strongly denied the allegations against him \u2013 including claims of rape \u2013 when they surfaced nearly 25 years ago at the trial of Frank Beck, a care-home warden suspected of abusing scores of children in his care. Beck, a former Liberal councillor, was given five life sentences. Yet, the 1991 case made sensational headlines for very different reasons. One of those headlines can be found in a faded newspaper cutting. It reads: \u2018My Commons date and night with MP Janner.\u2019 The witness in question was Paul Winston, then aged 30, who lived at one of Beck\u2019s care homes in Janner\u2019s constituency.

One was alleged to have been penned by Janner after they had stayed together at his home. \u2018It feels strange not to have you flipping around me like a friendly flea!,\u2019 the letter said. \u2018In fact \u2013 I miss you.\u2019 Referring to an encounter in the swimming pool of the Holiday Inn, Mr Winston said: \u2018I was fondled in my private area. It seemed at first like a bit of fun, being thrown around the water, but he would hold me close.\u2019 Beck used the testimony as part of his defence: that he was being prosecuted to divert attention from Janner and other high-profile (unnamed) paedophiles and that he was trying to shield the boys under his charge from them. Paul Winston was not the only witness to implicate Janner. Two others were called for the prosecution, saying Beck had raped them, but in cross-examination, they appeared to confirm some details of Mr Winston\u2019s story. Probes: Greville Janner, left in 1974, served as an MP for decades and was investigated in 1991, 2002 and 2007.\u00a0Janner was mentioned during the trial of paediophile Frank Beck, right,  who died in jail . One, a woman, said she heard an argument between Beck and Mr Winston in which he [Beck] was shouting that he wasn\u2019t [allowed] to see Greville Janner any more.\u2019 The other, a man, said Mr Winston had boasted about \u2018having friends in high places\u2019. Were the allegations made simply to muddy the waters? The jury thought so, finding Beck, who died in prison in 1994, guilty of the majority of charges against him. Days later, Janner, then in his 60s, broke his silence on the affair by making a personal statement to Parliament. Under parliamentary rules, personal statements are not debatable, so there were no follow-up questions from MPs. Janner told them: \u2018There was, of course, not a shred of truth in any of the allegations of criminal conduct against me during the trial. \u2018Meanwhile, as my wife, my family and I have had a taste of the suffering which Beck can impose on innocent people, will you join me in sending the real sufferers, the individuals who endured his homes and whose lives have been wrecked at his hands, the profound sympathy of us all?\u2019 His statement was greeted with cheers. Fellow Labour MP Keith Vaz described Janner as a \u2018brave man\u2019 and others passed on leader Neil Kinnock\u2019s \u2018tremendous support\u2019. Police interviewed Janner and Mr Winston, but no charges were ever brought against the MP. One of the detectives who worked on the Frank Beck case was Mick Creedon, who is now Chief Constable of Derbyshire. Last year he made a sensational claim in The Times. He said there was \u2018credible evidence\u2019 against Janner and that he and his colleagues wanted to make an arrest but were prevented by \u2018more senior people\u2019 from doing so. To put it bluntly, the investigation was blocked. Influential: Lord Janner was chair of the Holocaust Educational Trust and vice-president of the World Jewish Congress . Mr Creedon said: \u2018The decision was a clear one: he [Janner] will be interviewed by appointment and there won\u2019t be a search of his home address or his constituency office, of his office in the House of Commons. It was a decision made by people more senior than me.\u2019 The allegations against Janner remained buried in newspaper archives until the authorities began re-opening historic child abuse cases in the wake of the Jimmy Savile affair. Many revolve around the Elm Guest House, a gay sauna in Barnes, west London, where boys are believed to have been abused by a string of powerful men in the 1970s and 1980s, including Cyril Smith. One of the people who contacted the police was Paul Winston. At the same time, two booklets from the archives of former MP Andrew Faulds \u2013 who died in 2000 \u2013 emerged. One, a four-page leaflet entitled Janner Fails to Answer \u2018Sex With Boy\u2019 Evidence and published by a group calling itself Concerned Leicester Parents, landed on the prominent Labour backbencher\u2019s desk in 1992. The second, a 24-page booklet entitled Is Grenville Janner QC, MP, Above the Law?, arrived in 1995. Both booklets appear to have been printed professionally and sent anonymously to Mr Faulds (and presumably to several other influential figures) by individuals anxious to ensure further attention was paid to the 1991 trial. While Janner\u2019s health has made the prospect of prosecution impossible, the stench of an establishment cover-up will continue to surround this deeply troubling case . The 1995 booklet provides a detailed account of an alleged victim\u2019s testimony. It tells how the boy spoke of meeting Janner in the Commons when he was 13. He said was invited to Janner\u2019s home when his wife was away. \u2018We ended up in his bed together and he cuddled me. We cuddled and fondled together. I didn\u2019t like it and told him to stop.\u2019 So began a two-year sexual relationship, the boy claimed. The booklet also says that the boy \u2018had been able to provide the police with information about Janner\u2019s home, hotel rooms, life, habits and person in... infinite and verifiable detail\u2019. The 1992 leaflet also refers to an alleged victim\u2019s \u2018detailed\u2019 evidence: \u2018Such evidence, submitted under oath... requires a specific and detailed refutation.\u2019 Crown prosecution lawyers have spent nine months studying volumes of evidence gathered by Leicestershire police against Janner. This week officers visited Mr Winston, now in his mid-50s and living on the outskirts of Leicester, and other alleged victims in person to inform them of the decision not to proceed with the case. It has raised further questions about the CPS in the face of growing criticism of the conduct of Operation Elveden against tabloid journalists. This is the fourth time that Janner has escaped prosecution. He was interviewed by police after the Beck trial, and was the subject of further allegations of abuse in 2002, but these were not referred to the CPS. A third investigation was launched in 2006 after police received a complaint from yet another alleged victim. A dossier was passed to the CPS which decided there was \u2018insufficient evidence\u2019 to bring charges. Inevitably, while Janner\u2019s health has made the prospect of prosecution impossible, the stench of an establishment cover-up will continue to surround this deeply troubling case.\n"]}

{"question_id": 711, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: A Queensland man has opened up about a very special friendship between him and his best mate - a crocodile called 'Gregory'. Mick Tabone, 74, who previously owned and ran Johnstone River Crocodile Farm and zoo in far-north Queensland first came across the 5.2 metre croc in 1989. For 20 years the farmer would sit on the enormous creature's back while he chatted to him, and never once felt as though he was in danger. Rangers had already been trying to capture Gregory, who had apparently been killing cattle in Eubenangee Swamp near Mirriwinni, 70 kilometres south of Cairns for years, when they asked for Mr Tabone's help. Mick Tabone and Gregory the crocodile shared a strong bond during their 20 year long friendship . 'He was on the run for a couple of years, he had been a naughty boy and was taking cows,' Mr Tabone told Daily Mail Australia. 'The cattle used to come down there and have a drink and Gregory used to grab them by the nose and drown them,' he said. Mr Tabone then spent the next six months setting up traps for the huge creature, in a last bid to save him after a warrant had been issued to kill the croc. 'They had a trap for a couple of years but he just didn't go in, and after a certain amount of time, you know, there's a limit to the amount of time you can spend on this,' he said. 'They (National Parks) issued a warrant to the farmer to shoot him.' The farmer who owned the property where Gregory was snatching cattle called in the help of Mr Tabone and, helped by some 'freak weather', they were finally able catch the reptile. A heavy rainfall meant the trap which had been set up had moved and turtles had gone in after the bait, which Gregory then followed. Gregory was captured my Mr Tabone in 1989 after he was found stealing a local farmer's cattle . 'Three weeks later, water was down to about ankle-deep and I looked hard in the murky water and I said there's this great big massive animal in there,' Mr Tabone revealed. 'I said I've done the most horrible thing of my life, I've killed this big animal.' However upon closer inspection it appeared Gregory was alive and well, and had been keeping himself alive by coming up for air every few hours. 'Because of his size he was able to push the trap up to get a breath of air and then go back down for three to four hours,' the croc farmer said. After a huge operation which involved 16 men carrying Gregory onto the back of a truck and taking him back to Mr Tabone's farm, the creature was finally settled into what would be his home for the next two decades. The farmer describes the reptile that was his best friend as a 'funny animal', and said Gregory and him shared a special bond. He was named after Greg Cullen, the farmer whose cattle he was stealing. 'That gives me a memory of where I caught him from,' Mr Tabone said. The 5.2 metre croc and his farmer would spend time together every day, and Mr Tabone said he was never frightened or felt he was in danger . 'Greg would brings friends over to have a look at the crocodile named after him.' The crocodile would come when Mr Tabone called him, rushing up out of the water to greet his mate. The farmer would then spend time perched on Gregory's back, chatting to him about what was happening on the farm. 'Every day I was there I always spent time with him, I always sat on him,' Mr Tabone said. These meetings would take place between ten and 20 times a day, often in front of the tourists who came to visit the farm but sometimes just between the two of them. 'Sometimes depending if I had time I would go and sit on him and just hang out and chat to him'. When asked whether what he was doing was dangerous, Mr Tabone disagreed saying he never felt unsafe with Gregory. 'No, if I felt danger I wouldn't be in there. 'I love animals but I love living too,' he joked. Since Mr Tabone had to give up the farm in 2008 after repeated knee problems left him with less mobility than he was used to, the farmer has been back to visit Gregory only once. Mr Tabone\u00a0previously owned and ran Johnstone River Crocodile Farm and zoo in far-north Queensland . 'I went down after 18 months and went down to Gregory's cage and he was in the water,' he revealed. 'I called him over to the gate and he came over to me and the look on his face was just like \"Mick why did you leave me here?\"' 'They wouldn't let me go inside and I can see their point because it's not mine any more, I understand,' Mr Tabone said. 'He was a really lovely animal, the only reason I sold out was that I got an infection on my knee.' But Mr Tabone doesn't think he can go back to see Gregory again, who he believes has been moved to another farm. 'I can't go there again,' he said. Mr Tabone instead prefers to remember Gregory as he knew him, happily sitting with his farmer and best friend sitting on his back, having a chat.\n"]}

Castro passed away on Friday morning while in his sleep in San Diego where he was in hospice care, family spokesman James Garcia said. He was a self-made man, the embodiment of the American dream overcoming poverty and discrimination to graduate from college, and launch a successful career in politics and diplomacy. During his career, Castro also served as an American ambassador to three countries including El Salvador, Bolivia and Argentina. Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said Castro 'lived a full life of exemplary service to Arizona and its people.' Raul Hector Castro (above pictured in 2006), former governor of Arizona died on Friday morning . 'He was an honorable public servant, a history-maker, a beloved family man and a strong friend and fighter for Arizona,' Ducey said in a statement. Castro is survived by his wife, Pat  and his two daughters, Mary Pat James and Beth Castro, according to AZ Central. Growing up on the US-Mexico border near Douglas, Arizona, Castro saw discrimination around him. Former Arizona Governor and U.S. Ambassador Raul Hector Castro and his wife Pat, pictured in their Nogales, Arizona home in 2008 . 'America is the land of opportunity,' he told The Associated Press in 2010. 'Here, one can accomplish whatever they want to be. But you've got to work for it.' He said he wondered why the Hispanics were laborers and none delivered the mail or worked in offices. It did not seem right that the Hispanic children had to walk miles to school every day while the white kids would wave from a passing school bus, he said. Castro set out to beat the odds. When he could not get a job as a teacher \u2014 schools did not hire educators of Mexican descent back then \u2014 he became a drifter for a while, working as a farm hand and boxing here and there. He landed a job with the U.S. Consulate in the border city of Agua Prieta, Mexico. After five years, a senior official told him he was doing a great job but had no future in the foreign service \u2014 he had a Hispanic name and no Ivy League education. Castro then quit and moved to Tucson. A law school dean at the University of Arizona told Castro he would not be accepted because he could not afford to quit a job teaching Spanish. Besides, the dean said, Hispanic students did not do well in law school. Undeterred, Castro went to the university president, who convinced the dean to give Castro an opportunity to prove himself. Castro died in his sleep in San Diego where he was in hospice care, a family spokesman said (above Castro pictured far right in 1976 with governors at the time including Dick Lamm for Colorado, Jerry Apodaca for New Mexico . He excelled and went on to be elected the first Hispanic county attorney and later the first Hispanic judge in Pima County Superior Court. 'One of the finest men I ever knew,' former Gov. Rose Mofford, a fellow Democrat, said of Castro during a 2010 interview with the AP. Born in Cananea, Mexico, in 1916, some 50 miles south of Arizona, Castro grew up in Arizona and graduated from Douglas High School. He was the second youngest in a family with 12 children \u2014 11 boys and one girl. His father was a union leader forced out of Mexico for organizing a strike at the mine in Cananea. His father died when Castro was 12, and his mother became a midwife to feed the family. She delivered babies for the Mexican families around Douglas in exchange for flower, corn, beans and other staples. Castro\u00a0serve as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador, Argentina and Bolivia . Education was the best way out, Castro was determined. He went on to serve as U.S. ambassador to three Latin American countries under three U.S. presidents. Lyndon Johnson sent him to El Salvador, where Castro became known as 'Yankee Castro' to differentiate him from the other Raul Castro \u2014 the brother of Cuban dictator Fidel Castro. Johnson later sent him to Bolivia and he stayed for a short time under Richard Nixon before returning to Arizona and making the first of two bids for governor. His statewide races were two of the closest gubernatorial elections in state history. He lost to Republican Jack Williams in 1970 by 1.5 percentage points. He fared better four years later as the Republican Party was embroiled in the Watergate corruption scandal. Castro defeated Republican Russ Williams by less than one percentage point three months after Nixon resigned in controversy. As an ambassador and judge, Castro was used to having unquestioned authority. However, he struggled to adjust to the checks and balances imposed on a governor, said Alfredo Gutierrez, a Democrat and legislative leader while Castro was governor. 'It was a very difficult beginning for him,' Gutierrez said. 'It was quite an adjustment.' Castro was governor for two and a half years before resigning when President Jimmy Carter appointed him ambassador to Argentina. He told the AP he was proud of his work motivating Hispanics to vote, many of them for the first time despite deep nerves. 'The thing that bothered me the most when I resigned as governor, the Hispanic community felt that I had betrayed them, because they worked so hard to get me elected,' he said decades later. 'I had to convince them and persuade them that being an American ambassador was just as important as being a governor. I had more authority.' Castro spent his waning years living in Nogales and talking to students around the state, motivating them to work hard and chase lofty dreams.\n"]}

How can the people in Iowa and New Hampshire get to know the \"real Hillary,\" the Midwestern Methodist? (As a friend told me, she's someone who \"likes to sing 'God Bless America' on New Year's Eve.\") And how to open the minds of people about someone everyone already has an opinion about? Same questions, no doubt, that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie Barack Obama, and same questions they asked when, as first lady, she ran for the Senate in New York. In that race, she ended up spending a lot of all-ears quality time in upstate New York. In this race, she could be spending a lot of all-you-can-eat time at Diners, Drive-ins and Dives \u2014 just like the TV show. (Except Guy Fieri would probably have been recognized by the crowd at Chipotle. Just sayin.' ) Dining aside, it's hard -- almost impossible -- to soft-launch a campaign with a superstar politician.  All the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops can't mask the Houdini-like effort Hillary Clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality -- that even her \"Scooby-Doo\" van is followed by throngs of press. (I half imagined an O.J. moment with a helicopter hovering as she made her way down I-80.) Try as she might to launch with a humble start \u2014 not entitled to anything \u2014 she still is who she is. Virtually unchallenged. Not to mention famous, accomplished and controversial. In watching it all unfold, it's hard to underestimate the task at hand. It's also hard to figure out whether it's actually going to work. Hillary Clinton \u2014 and her experienced campaign team \u2014 are disciplined and relentlessly on message. That's usually a good thing when you're running a presidential campaign. But when you're sitting at a community college in Iowa and you tick off your rationale for running and your resume \u2014 unprompted \u2014 it seems less effective and more oddly incongruent. (Especially when the former secretary of state described her tenure in five words \u2014 as \"standing up for our country.\" Short shrift, it seems to me.) Maybe it's that the old lessons of message discipline don't work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create \u2014 at least not with this candidate. The hardest combination in politics is that just-right mixture of spontaneity and discipline. The ability to understand exactly what you have to say (over and over) and then say it as if you have never said it before. And look like you're having a great time doing it. We like to call it authenticity, but it's probably not. It's a honed skill that combines connection and gravitas, both of which the voters demand in a president. (A majority of voters -- 53% --  say they want to vote for someone who has been financially successful, as opposed to someone who has not.) So there's this balance: If you're too much like them, you're nothing special to vote for. But if you're too different, you're not relatable. It's a balance that doesn't come easily to Hillary Clinton. But she's not alone. When President George H.W. Bush was running for re-election in 1992, he was facing his own image issues. His populist challengers were calling him insensitive to middle class woes in the struggling state of New Hampshire. Bush tried mightily to drop the presidential persona, did some town halls, and famously declared:  \"Message: I care.\" Some said he actually read it from a cue card, but he also said this: \"I don't know what I have to do to convince people here that I really care about this (the economy). I do.\" He lost. To an empathetic I-feel-your-pain Bill Clinton. And the rest, as they say, is history. Or, in Hillary's case, at least trying to make history.\n"]}
{"question_id": 714, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: The Tories today launched an extraordinary attack on Ed Miliband, claiming that after stabbing his brother in the back he now wants to do the same to Britain. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon claimed the Labour leader was willing to trade away Britain's nuclear deterrent in order to secure power in a backroom deal with the Scottish Nationalists. Mr Miliband said the Conservative campaign had 'descended into the gutter' and claimed\u00a0David Cameron 'should be ashamed'. Deeply personal: Defence Secretary Michael Fallon  claimed Ed Miliband is 'so desperate' for power he is willing to weaken UK defences to win support from SNP . He confirmed that a Conservative government would go ahead with four new Trident nuclear missile submarines to replace the existing fleet, at a cost of \u00a3100billion. Labour rushed to say it was also backing four submarines, despite Ed Balls last month saying he was examining the idea of cutting it to three. Doubt has been cast on Labour's commitment to the deterrent because Mr Miliband could be forced to rely on the SNP support to form a government. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that scrapping the Trident missile system, which is based in Scotland, would be a red line for her propping up a Labour government in Westminster. Mr Fallon launched a highly personal attack on Mr Miliband, saying it was an issue of trust and leadership. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'We need to be absolutely clear when we come to this decision in the next parliament. 'We saw in that leadership election just what he would do to get into power. We saw what he did to his own brother. We need to know what he would do. 'We can't be sure what kind of backstairs deal he is likely to do with the SNP ... that is the uncertainty. We have seen what he is prepared to do to get into power.' In a speech today, he said: 'Ed Miliband stabbed his own brother in the back to become Labour leader. Now he is willing to stab the United Kingdom in the back to become prime minister.' Mr Fallon will insist the Tories would 'never' do a deal on the future of Trident in another coalition \u2013 and that a man prepared to stab his brother in the back to win the Labour leadership cannot be trusted not to risk the nation's security. 'Nicola Sturgeon could not be clearer. She has told Ed Miliband that scrapping Trident \u2013 our country's vital nuclear deterrent \u2013 is a red line she will not cross,' the Defence Secretary will say. 'If he wants the keys to No 10, he must abandon any plans to renew our current Vanguard ballistic missile submarines. 'The SNP's childlike world view would sacrifice the long-term security of the UK. The nuclear deterrent protects all of Britain, and the SNP represents a separatist threat that would dangerously weaken our collective defence. Britain doesn't pay ransoms and the Conservatives would never bow to demands from Scottish separatists. Vow: The attack comes as the Tories pledge to build a \u00a3100billion fleet of four new Trident submarines . Mr Miliband brushed off the criticism, insisting he had 'got use to' Conservative attacks. Speaking at an event in London, the Labour leader added: 'The Conservative Party can throw what they like at me, they can make all the personal attacks on me that they want to, but I've got use to it. 'And you know what? I'm resilient. And I'm resilient for one reason alone - because I'm fighting for the British people in this campaign. 'I'm fighting for the kind of country the British people want.' Mr Miliband said that over the first two weeks of the Conservative campaign, it was clear 'they have nothing positive to say about the country'. The Labour leader said: 'I think David Cameron should be ashamed. He's got nothing positive to say about the future of the country, he's got no forward vision for the country. And he sends out his minions, like Michael Fallon, to engage in desperate smears. 'I think decent Conservatives right across our country, decent Conservative MPs, decent Conservative party members, decent people right across Britain, will say `Come on, we're better than this kind of politics'. There is mounting Labour panic at polls suggesting the rampant SNP is on course for a landslide north of the border. Such a political earthquake would be likely to leave the SNP holding the balance of power at Westminster and determining who is in government for the first time in the 300-year history of the Union. Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander told the same programme that the Labour Party had made it 'crystal clear' it supports the renewal of Trident. He said: 'This is desperate stuff from a rattled campaign that spent yesterday defending tax avoidance and is now descending into politics of the gutter. 'This is not up for negotiation with the SNP or with any other party. I don't know how I can say it plainer than that. 'We are absolutely committed to a continuous at-sea deterrent. The Tories are like a wounded, cornered animal at the moment.' SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon has made clear that scrapping the Trident missile system, which is based in Scotland, would be a red line for her propping up a Labour government in Westminster . Diane Abbott, who used Twitter to question the \u00a3100billion cost of the weapons system . Labour leader Ed Miliband faces a challenge from dozens of Labour candidates calling for Trident to be scrapped. Among them is Diane Abbott, who used Twitter to question the \u00a3100billion cost of the weapons system. 'How exactly does submarine system designed for Cold War era combat new threats from international terrorism?' she asked. 'Renewing Trident could cost \u00a3100 billion. Would pay for: 150,000 new nurses; 1.5 million affordable homes; 2 million jobs & much more.' Labour CND lists 52 candidates standing for election on May 7 calling for Trident to be scrapped. They call for 'a Labour Government that delivers on disarmament of the UK's nuclear weapons, as we are bound to under the Non-Proliferation Treaty'. Both Labour and the SNP have ruled out a formal coalition, but left the door open to a looser deal that would see Mr Miliband in power even if he wins fewer seats than the Tories. Earlier this year, Mr Miliband suggested he might back a cheaper Trident replacement than the current plan, estimated at \u00a3100billion for four submarines at about \u00a35billion each, and annual running costs of \u00a33billion over the subs' lifetime of about 30 years. Today's Tory pledge puts Labour in a difficult position, since ruling out any compromise on Trident would infuriate the SNP and many voters in Scotland, where support for the system's renewal is lower than in the rest of the UK. Mr Fallon will add today: 'It is a sign of his weakness he has failed to rule out a deal. Voters can only conclude he would be prepared to trade Britain's security just to get his hands on the keys to Downing Street. 'The future of our country's security will be on the ballot paper too. There will be a clear choice between a Conservative government that will put our national security first. Or Ed Miliband, a man so desperate for power he is ready to barter away our nuclear deterrent in a backroom deal with the SNP.' Liberal Democrat defence spokesman Sir Nick Harvey said he did not see any need for Trident to be patrolling the seas 24/7 while the UK has 'no known nuclear adversary'. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the nuclear deterrent was 'worth retaining', but said two submarines would provide a 'perfectly meaningful deterrent', although not on a 'continuous basis'. Retaining three submarines would enable the UK to have a 'continuous at-sea deterrence', he added. Natalie Bennett, leader of the Green Party, said: 'This latest round of Tory speculation doesn't conceal the fact that the Labour Party is committed to renewing our multibillion pound nuclear weapons system. 'The truth is that the Labour leadership has made it clear that they will prioritise spending \u00a3100billion on a cold war relic - rather than investing in the schools and hospitals that this country so desperately needs. 'Only one party is standing up to Trident across the UK. Green MPs will put pressure on the Government to ensure that a proper debate is had over Trident.'\n"]}

'He didn't have heart problems' Angus Hawley's brother reveals shock after ex-husband of Antonia Kidman dies from a suspected heart attack in New York after 'returning from a swim'. Angus and Antonia pictured together in 2005 at the Chuan Spa opening in the Langham Hotel . Mr Hawley, who was in New York attending a business conference at the time, collapsed after returning from a swim. 'He did go for a big swim in the morning, he trains very hard,' David said of his brother, who he described as a 'bit of a fitness fanatic' and was known to lead a healthy and active lifestyle. 'I think his body clock was round the wrong way and it just got everything round the wrong way and he's over done it.' Mr Hawley was a father to four children, Lucia, 16, Hamish, 14, James, 12, and Sybella, eight, all of whom he shared with Nicole Kidman's sister Antonia before their 2007 split. The children are reportedly set to join the family in Sydney as they rally around David's second wife Prue Fisher, who he married in Palm Beach in 2011.

The former couple are pictured above with Antonia's parents Janelle and the late Dr. Antony Kidman . David described his brother, a business development manager at Valor Private Wealth,\u00a0as 'one of the most beautiful men that I have ever known. 'He is absolutely adored by everybody, he made everybody feel like he's their best friend and that's why everybody loved him. And he loved everybody else, it's just a really emotional time.' Prue is being comforted by her family in Sydney, after they traveled from Orange in New South Wales to be by her side. She was reportedly seen at the Bondi Icebergs public pool, a place her late husband often frequented, on Sunday. Moved on: Both Antonia and Mr Hawley remarried following their divorce in 2007 - she to businessman Craig Marran (L) in 2010, and he to Sydney fashion boutique manager Prue  the following year (R) David described Prue as 'devastated' saying she's 'terrible, terrible', adding, 'it's a huge hole in our lives. 'They were absolutely devoted to each other and Prue's relationship with Angus's children was fantastic,' said David of his late brother's wife. 'His wife adores him, and he adored her, his four children, it's just so sad. It's a tragic loss to our family and to his family, it's just a nightmare. 'No matter what happens for the rest of her life, she'll still be my sister-in-law.' On Saturday another of Angus's brothers Phillip released a statement, describing his death as 'sudden' and 'very unexpected' to\u00a0News.com.au.

He is said to have later passed away in the ambulance on the way to hospital. Mr Hawley's death comes less than seven months after the sudden passing of Nicole and Antonia's father Dr. Antony Kidman, who also  suffered a suspected heart attack, in Singapore. Family tragedy: Mr Hawley's death comes less than seven months after the sudden passing of Nicole and Antonia's father Dr. Antony, who also suffered a heart attack, in Singapore . Both 44-years-old Antonia and her ex husband both remarried following their divorce in 2007 - she to businessman Craig Marran in 2010, and he to Sydney fashion boutique manager Prue, the following year. He has kept himself largely out of the spotlight following his split from Antonia and a battle with depression. The father of four checked himself into a Sydney rehab clinic in 2007 following a period of mental health issues. Tragic: Antonia's second husband Craig Marran accompanied her, her sister Nicole and husband Keith Urban to Dr. Antony's funeral in September last year . He told Woman's Day in 2009: 'I was depressed, out of control and full of self-loathing, and I resorted to drugs to get through it. 'I wasn't in a happy place and it was an appalling thing, but I was sick, and at least I was big enough to do something about it.' Merivale hotel founder Justin Hemmes, has paid tribute to his good friend Angus, explaining to the\u00a0Daily Telegraph that the pair became friends at just four years old . Family man: Dr. Antony Kidman was visiting Antonia and her family in Singapore when he passed away . Day of mourning: Antonia's\u00a0six children Lucia, Hamish, James, Sybella, Nicholas, two, and Alexander, one, attended the funeral along with Nicole's daughters Sunday Rose and Faith . Support: Keith and Craig acted as pallbearers at the funeral, as did family friends Russell Crowe and Channel Nine newsreader Peter Overton . 'He was my next door neighbour but quickly became a best friend, one I was fortunate enough to have by my side ever since,' he said, describing Mr Hawley as 'the most caring, thoughtful and loving man.' 'The most loving father to his four wonderful children and adoring wife. His family was his treasure. His kids were his life,' he continued. Mr Hawley's death is the second devastating loss the Kidman family has suffered in the past seven months, after Dr. Antony Kidman sadly collapsed and died in a Singapore hotel last September at the age of 75.

Close knit: Nicole and Antonia are pictured here with their late father in 1990 . A respected Sydney psychologist, Dr. Antony was in the country visiting Antonia and his six grandchildren. Antonia, a journalist and writer, is currently based in Singapore with her second husband with whom she shares two sons, Nicholas, two, and Alexander, one. She remembered the close relationship she had with her father at his funeral last year and said they were 'similar in many ways'. New home: Antonia resides in Singapore with second husband Craig. She's pictured here with Nicole, who lives in Nashville with Keith Urban, in 2005 . 'I'm so lucky to be his daughter,' 47-year-old Nicole said, 'and that he chose my mother to make me with.' Appearing on Ellen\u00a0last October, Nicole said husband Keith Urban had to carry her, sometimes literally, because she was 'so devastated' by the loss.

In her most extraordinary offer yet the nationalist leader called on the Labour leader to help her \u2018lock\u2019 David Cameron out of Downing Street. And crucially, she said the offer stood \u2018regardless of who is the biggest party\u2019 in the House of Commons. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon (pictured) said she would try to 'lock David Cameron out of Downing Street' regardless of whether the Tories finished as the largest party next month . Her comments raise the prospect of Mr Miliband ending up in Number 10 as a result of nationalist support despite having fewer seats in the House of Commons than the Tories. Miss Sturgeon\u2019s latest offer came amid continued fallout from claims she told a French diplomat she wanted David Cameron to remain as Prime Minister. The report of the conversation, on February 26, between Miss Sturgeon and Sylvie Bermann, the French Ambassador, was contained within a Scotland Office memo leaked to the Daily Telegraph. The claim was denied both by the French embassy and Miss Sturgeon. Miss Sturgeon also denied a separate claim in the memo that Mr Miliband is \u2018not Prime Minister material\u2019. It undermines the SNP leader\u2019s claim that she wants to build a progressive alliance with Labour to keep the Conservatives out of office. The SNP\u2019s opponents say it would favour another Tory-led government, against which it could campaign in an attempt to make an \u2018out\u2019 vote more likely in another referendum. In an article for the Observer addressed to Mr Miliband she wrote: \u2018If together our parties have the parliamentary numbers required after 7 May, and regardless of which is the biggest party, will he and Labour join with us in locking David Cameron out of Downing Street?\u2019 Ed Miliband has ruled out going into Coalition with SNP but has not rejected the prospect of working with them . Chancellor George Osborne said the prospect of the SNP propping up the Labour Party in power was an 'alliance between a party that wants to bankrupt the country and a party that wants to break up the country' Her comments heaped pressure on Labour to rule out any deal with the nationalists. Labour has ruled out a formal coalition with the SNP but has refused to say if it would enter a looser agreement on policy areas to stay in power. Tory chief whip Michael Gove said: \u2018My concern is that if the SNP win the number of seats they are projected to, they could hold the balance of power and hold Labour leader Ed Miliband to ransom.\u2019 Miss Sturgeon is calling for a \u00a3180billion debt-fuelled public spending spree and an end to the Trident nuclear deterrent. Former cabinet minister Peter Hain told Radio 4\u2019s The World This Weekend he said: \u2018It is a curious plea being made by Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP: vote anything except Labour to get a Labour government. That makes no sense at all.\u2019 A Panelbase poll released yesterday put the SNP, on 45 per cent, with Labour on 29 per cent. If repeated across Scotland, the poll findings suggest the SNP would win 29 of the 41 seats won by Labour in 2010. A BBC reporter said he suffered an onslaught of \u2018vicious abuse\u2019 from Scottish Nationalists simply for asking Nicola Sturgeon about the claims that she would prefer David Cameron to remain as Prime Minister. Scotland correspondent James Cook was called \u2018scum of the earth\u2019 and \u2018lying scum\u2019 by SNP supporters on Twitter. One wrote that Mr Cook was \u2018in the gutter\u2019 and trying to \u2018hide his SNP hatred\u2019, while another accused him of being a \u2018typical BBC/Westminster mouthpiece\u2019. On Saturday Mr Cook wrote on the site: \u2018What an extraordinary level of vicious abuse I have received today for simply reporting the news. Is this the country we want folks? Is it?\u2019 He added: \u2018Of course there are some SNP strategists \u2013 I know, I\u2019ve spoken to them \u2013 who say in private a Tory victory would hasten independence. \u2018Of course I should ask tough questions of politicians. This is a democracy. This is my role in it. And finally if, despite my 23 years of reporting things straight, you think I simply make up conversations then do feel free to unfollow me.\u2019 Miss Sturgeon later praised Mr Cook in an apparent attempt to calm the situation. She tweeted: \u2018James Cook is one of the best journalists in Scotland. Tough but scrupulously fair and a consummate professional.\u2019\n"]}

The Foxes boss has taken advice from Wilkinson, who he played under at Sheffield Wednesday, as Leicester battle the drop. They host Swansea on Saturday looking for a third straight win and will escape the drop zone for the first time since November if Burnley fail to win at Everton and they beat Swansea by three goals. Nigel Pearson's Foxes have beaten West Ham and West Brom in their last two games . Pearson has come under the spotlight this season after a foul-mouthed spat with a fan and a bizarre touchline altercation with Crystal Palace's James McArthur. Wilkinson, who won the First Division title with Leeds in 1992, had been a mentor for Pearson before this season and he has spoken to the ex-England caretaker manager for advice. Pearson said: 'On a professional level I have one or two people I speak to if there's something I need a bit of feedback on. Howard Wilkinson is one. 'I have a lot of respect for people I have worked with. I have friends and family I speak to, my wife remains a very important person for me in terms of getting a balanced view on life. Jamie Vardy scored an injury-time winner to improve his side's slim chance of Premier League survival . 'I have a lot of very good friends and colleagues at Leicester and the good thing about how we work is we're all doing a job in preparing the players but the coaches do stretch themselves as well.' The Foxes have beaten West Ham and West Brom in their last two games and still have to play relegation rivals Sunderland, Burnley and QPR. But Pearson, who has a fully fit squad, wants complete focus on the Swans as they bid to become only the third team to survive in the Barclays Premier League after being bottom at Christmas. Leicester's Andrej Kramaric (right) and\u00a0Robert Huth go through their paces at training on Thursday . He said: 'It is important for us now that the players, and everyone else at the club, stay very much focused on now what is a seven-game season. 'Yes, there are lots of positives, especially getting six points, but we have still got an awful lot to do, and that is why there is no room for us to take any other stance than that.

A 57-year-old man in Texas was jailed this weekend after nearly two decades of code violations for his unruly lawn came back to haunt him. But Grand Prairie resident Rick Yoes claims the city didn't do enough to warn him about the citations, which officials claim were sent out in the mail. Yoes, an electrician at Tarrant County College, was shocked when he received a postcard a couple weeks ago saying he had six outstanding code violations totaling $1,700 and that there was a warrant out for his arrest. Issues Yoes has been cited for in the past include  high grass over a foot long, overhanging tree limbs, a dilapidated wood fence, an inoperable vehicle and junk in the yard, and a dirty swimming pool. 'I can\u2019t really afford to pay a lawyer to fight it,' Yoes told\u00a0CBS Dallas/Fort Worth. 'I couldn\u2019t really afford to pay them $1,700 in fines that he said I owed him. I didn\u2019t know what else to do I just turned myself in.' Yoes turned himself in this weekend and spent two nights in jail before a friend paid his fine to secure his release. Daughter Angel Yoes told the Fresno People's Media that when her father received the warning, he took off all his vacation days at work and found a replacement so that he could serve 17 days in prison rather than pay the fine. Father and daughter say they've had issues with code enforcement in the past, but have tried to keep the yard up to standard when the previously received warnings. \u00a0However, Yoes claims he didn't know about the six violations he was confronted with recently. Scroll down for video . Let it grow: The city of Grand Prairie says they tried several times to reach out to Yoes over the years, but that the man refused to keep his lawn up to code. Above, Yoes' home in Grand Prairie . Too long: Above, another view of Yoes' lawn from Bing. Among the issues with Yoes' lawn were overhanging branches long enough to hit a passing truck . Repeat offender: Above, a picture of Yoes' lawn on one of the dozens of visits code enforces have taken to his property since 1996 . Upset: Yoes says the city didn't do enough to warn him of the mounting fines for his lawn. Pictured on the left in a photo posted to his Facebook . Following Yoes' stint behind bars, city officials released a list of Yoes' violations on his Coffeyville Trail home and insisted that they had given him plenty of warning to get his yard up to code and avoid fines. 'Unfortunately, since 2014, he has not responded to our repeated requests to jointly solve the problems, which has forced us to ultimately cite him for the violations,' the city said in a statement. 'Our Municipal Courts are always amenable to work with citizens on a suitable plan for unpaid citations, but this citizen chose not to take advantage of that opportunity, either.' Officer Mark Beseda of the Grand Prairie Police Department added: 'I can assure you our city would never simply place a citizen in jail for failing to mow their grass.' In an interview with WFAA, Yoes claims he never got any letters from the city for the citations. 'I assume they probably mailed me something; never landed in my hands,' Yoes said. 'If they sent me certified mail, I don't pick certified mail up.' But in another interview with CBS, Yoes tells a different story, saying he received the letters but never opened them because he thought they had to do with another legal matter. He says he's upset with the system the city uses to send out citations. 'When you get a traffic ticket the officer brings you the ticket,' Yoes said.

Ed Miliband will today pledge to cut the deficit every year if Labour wins the election. In a last-ditch attempt to steal the Tories\u2019 mantle as the party of economic responsibility, he will warn supporters that Labour faces coming to power in a \u2018time of scarcity\u2019. Launching the party\u2019s manifesto in Manchester, Mr Miliband will claim \u2018not one policy\u2019 in it would be funded through additional government borrowing. He will insist a Labour government would \u2018cut the deficit every year\u2019 and have national debt falling \u2018as soon as possible\u2019, though he will not set a date. Labour\u2019s manifesto, published last night, contains a commitment on its first page to a \u2018Budget Responsibility Lock\u2019. The party says this would be \u2018the basis for all our plans because it is by securing our national finances that we are able to secure the family finances of the working people of Britain\u2019. Mr Miliband infamously forgot to make any mention of the deficit in his party conference speech last year, and polls show Labour lags far behind the Conservatives in trust on managing the public finances. But Mr Miliband will today insist that Labour is \u2018not only the party of change but the party of responsibility too\u2019. He will accuse the Tories of \u2018throwing spending promises around with no idea of where the money is coming from\u2019. The Labour leader will pledge \u2018strong, fair fiscal rules\u2019 meaning the national debt falls and a surplus on the \u2018current budget\u2019 \u2013 applying to day-to-day spending, not capital spending \u2013 is secured \u2018as soon as possible in the next parliament\u2019. He will say: \u2018The very start of our manifesto is different to previous elections. \u2018It does not do what most manifestos do...It does something different: its very first page sets out a vow to protect our nation\u2019s finances; a clear commitment that every policy in this manifesto is paid for without a single penny of extra borrowing. \u2018The plan we lay before you is no less ambitious because we live in a time of scarcity. It is more ambitious because it starts from a clear commitment to balance the books.\u2019 Policies in Labour\u2019s manifesto include a \u00a32.5billion NHS fund paid for from a mansion tax, a levy on tobacco firms and closing a hedge fund tax avoidance loophole. The Labour leader, pictured in Leeds yesterday after launching the health manifesto, will insist a Labour government would \u2018cut the deficit every year\u2019 and have national debt falling \u2018as soon as possible' Scrapping the \u2018non-dom\u2019 rule could set Labour on a collision course with the Governor of the Bank of England. Mark Carney features among a list of heavyweight figures in the City who could be forced to pay higher taxes if Labour wins power next month. The Canadian is one of 116,000 non-doms in Britain, meaning he has to pay tax on his UK earnings but not on income generated overseas. Mr Miliband wants to scrap the tax break, describing it as \u2018indefensible\u2019. A spokesman for the Bank defended the Governor\u2019s status, saying: \u2018This is not a choice. It\u2019s a straight outcome of the tests that determine domicile status in the UK.\u2019 He added that Mr Carney pays full UK tax on his \u00a3874,000 pay package. Others who would be affected by the crackdown include the foreign-born chiefs of RBS and Lloyds. It will also commit to 25 hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds, paid for by increasing the banking levy, and smaller class sizes for five, six and seven-year-olds, funded by scrapping the free schools programme. George Osborne said Labour\u2019s plans would \u2018bankrupt\u2019 the country, and put the 300-year-old union with Scotland at risk if the party were propped up by the Scottish Nationalists. \u2018If you have an Ed Miliband/Scottish Nationalist government, they will trash this economy,\u2019 Mr Osborne told the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr. He said the Tories had a \u2018balanced plan\u2019 to finish the job of restoring order to the public finances that involved cutting \u00a31 in every \u00a3100 of government spending for a further two years. Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg accused Labour of \u2018playing Russian roulette\u2019 with the economy. Labour officials said \u2018any government led by Ed Miliband\u2019 would not compromise on the deficit. That will be seen as a bid to ease fears a Labour administration propped up by the SNP would wreak havoc with the public finances. \u25a0 Labour would ensure Premiership football teams give millions to smaller clubs, Andy Burnham has said. The shadow health spokesman said it would enforce a Premier League commitment to invest 5 per cent of the proceeds from lucrative TV rights deals in grassroots sport. By Jason Groves, Deputy Political Editor for The Daily Mail . Labour yesterday admitted it cannot match David Cameron\u2019s pledge to provide the NHS with an \u00a38billion cash injection. The two main parties angrily traded blows over which would provide the most secure future for the Health Service. But independent experts urged Labour to back plans to plug a \u00a330billion hole in the books. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper (pictured) repeatedly refused to say whether Labour would provide the \u00a38billion funding . These plans, drawn up by NHS boss Simon Stevens, commit the service to making \u00a322billion of savings, but also require an extra \u00a38billion a year by 2020. The independent Nuffield Trust said failure to make the financial commitment would have \u2018serious consequences for the viability of the service\u2019. Chief executive Nigel Edwards said Labour\u2019s stance was \u2018regrettable\u2019, adding: \u2018The NHS has a plan, which has been endorsed by all leading organisations in the sector. Labour are now the only party not to have committed to this \u00a38billion and yet their proposals are likely to require more spending on the NHS.\u2019 The Nuffield Trust also warned that Labour\u2019s \u2018health manifesto\u2019, launched at the weekend, suggested a return to the top-down management style it used when it was last in office. Mr Edwards said: \u2018The level of detail set out in this [Labour] document is somewhat concerning. The NHS is complex and often responds best to locally driven initiatives. \u2018There is a risk that elements of this detailed approach could trigger further reorganisation.\u2019 Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper repeatedly refused to say whether Labour would provide the \u00a38billion funding. She said: \u2018We will make sure the NHS has the money it needs and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve always done. \u2018We\u2019ll have practical measures that will raise \u00a32.5billion \u2013 we can say where the money will come from, the Tories can\u2019t.\u2019 Miss Cooper also denied that Labour\u2019s target to cut tax dodging by \u00a37.5billion was simply \u2018plucked from the air\u2019. The party has promised to reduce evasion and avoidance by this amount by the end of 2017. But tax experts warned it would lead to a crackdown by HMRC on small firms \u2013 further souring relations between Labour and business. Challenged on the pledge yesterday, Miss Cooper said: \u2018It is an ambitious and it\u2019s a stretching target but we think it is right to do so because under the Conservatives the gap between the amount of tax that should be being paid and that is being paid has been widening.\u2019\n"]}

Message: This picture of Bahar Mustafa, the student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University, shows her posing in front if a 'no white men' sign while pretending to cry . Row: Ms Mustafa appeared to ban men and white people from attending the meeting in this Facebook post . The photograph first appeared on Miss Mustafa's Facebook profile on Tuesday, six days after she told white people and men 'not to come' to a meeting she was organising to discuss 'diversifying the curriculum'.

Goldsmiths' union eventually backed down after a backlash from students. The ban on men and white students is surprising, since the organisers claim to promote \u2018zero tolerance\u2019 for \u2018all forms of prejudice, discrimination and oppression\u2019.

One Facebook friend, called Jessie, wrote: 'You do not speak for me. I voted you into the position of Welfare and Diversity Officer. 'Your passion is inspiring. But I can't defend this. We cannot best \"them\" by being them. We cannot demand to be included by excluding. 'To specifically exclude a group of people from any event is to become the oppressor. As the oppressed, we should not wish to inflict upon others that pain which we know to be harmful to us. 'This is not the Goldsmiths I love'. Bahar Mustafa, student union Welfare and Diversity Officer at Goldsmiths University in London, sparked anger when she banned men and white people from a 'diversity' meeting . Graduate: Miss Mustafa recently completed an MA in gender and media studies and won election to become the union's\u00a0Welfare and Diversity Officer . Miss Mustafa recently graduated from Goldsmiths with an MA in gender and media studies. Criticism: Critics have said that Miss Mustafa\u2019s actions had made it \u2018very difficult\u2019 for male students but friends have also defended her . She is understood to live with her mother Nursen, 55, father Ismail, 57, and sister Ipek, 23, in Enfield in a \u00a3450,000 three-bedroom terrace. The Daily Mail tried to contact Miss Mustafa but she was not available to explain the comments apparently posted from her Facebook account. A friend told MailOnline  she 'does not want to talk to you'. Yesterday a spokesman for Goldsmiths said the university had no part in the decisions of the union, adding: \u2018We are proud of our diverse community and do not tolerate any form of oppression, including racism, sexism or any other form of bigotry. \u2018We have written to the students\u2019 union to express our concern.\u2019 The union said: \u2018Goldsmiths Students\u2019 Union places huge importance on equality and diversity. \u2018It is in this vein that we host spaces where specific minority groups who experience similar discrimination can talk together confidently about overcoming the structural disadvantages and prejudice they face. \u2018The accusation that we discriminate is one we refute wholeheartedly'. Goldsmiths has insisted the Student Union is a separate organisation over which it has no control .\n"]}

The chair was on the first class promenade deck when the liner sank after hitting an iceberg on its maiden voyage in 1912. It was found bobbing on the surface of the Atlantic by the crew of the Mackay-Bennett, who were sent to recover the bodies of the victims after the tragedy. A 103-year-old deckchair recovered from the wreck of the Titanic is expected to fetch around \u00a380,000 at auction . The ship's log records six or seven deckchairs being picked up and taken back to port in Halifax, Nova Scotia. One was given by a crew member to Captain Julien Lemarteleur, who had previously worked on board the Mackay-Bennett. It has since been owned for 15 years by an English Titanic collector who kept it by a large window overlooking the sea at his home on the south coast. The anonymous owner has never sat on it due to its fragile state and instead used it as a display item. Andrew Aldridge, of auctioneers Henry Aldridge and Son, described the piece as one of 'the most important [bits] of Titanic memorabilia around'. He said: 'It is incredibly rare to find something of that size that was on Titanic, was salvaged and that still exists today. Six or seven recovered deckchairs were stacked on the deck of the Mackay-Bennett as it arrived in Nova Scotia . Titanic (above) sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14 . 'You would not use it for practical purposes but have it on display. It would make a great conversation piece. 'There were a couple of thousand deckchairs on board Titanic and many of them were found floating on the wreck site. 'We have been able to access the Mackay-Bennett's log book, which confirmed the crew not only picked up deckchairs but that the ship's carpenter spent time repairing some of them on the way back to Halifax.' The chair is made of teak wood and has an adjustable footrest at the front. It is 57 inches long, 23 inches wide and 35 inches tall. It has a five pointed star on top of it, which was the emblem of White Star Line - the company that owned the Titanic .

It includes a signed affidavit from Margarete Pennington, who was Mr Lemarteleur's housekeeper in the 1960s. In it she states: 'I personally saw the deckchair that Captain Lemarteleur told me about on many occasions. He said that various pieces of debris taken from the ocean including this Titanic deckchair he acquired. 'I recognise the chair as the same chair I saw in the captain's garage and of which the captain identified as coming from the Titanic.' Craig Sopin, 57, a lawyer from Philadelphia, owns one of the world's largest collections of Titanic memorabilia. He also authenticated the chair and said: 'It isn't often that one has the opportunity to acquire such an important part of Titanic's story. 'For such a significant item to have such a meticulous chain of custody is nothing short of astonishing. Its history can be traced from the auction house back to Titanic itself.' Titanic sank with the loss of 1,522 lives four hours after it struck on iceberg at 10.20pm on April 14. A ship, the Carpathia, picked up more than 700 survivors in lifeboats hours later and took them back to New York.

The 23-year-old Ansari, who celebrated his call-up with four Essex wickets at The Kia Oval, graduated from Cambridge two years ago with a double first in politics and sociology. He is halfway through a 40,000-word masters on the 1960s civil rights movement in the American south, and plays the piano to a high level. It's fair to say he would be England's most academically gifted cricketer since Ed Smith \u2013 another Cambridge double first \u2013 won three Test caps in 2003. Surrey's Zafar Ansarihas been called up to England's ODI squad for the clash against Ireland . The left-handed batsman and left-arm spinner also has an eye on a career in academia one day . 'I think my Surrey team-mates enjoy having someone to talk to about things they don't think about or talk about necessarily,' Ansari told Sportsmail. 'I try to use the studies to avoid taking cricket too seriously. I think cricket is a sport, and isn't that important in the grand scheme of things. My studies and cricket are tools for each other, and I do try to see them in those instrumental ways.' Ansari, part of a young England squad picked with the 2019 World Cup in mind, opens in four-day cricket for his county, but bats in the middle order in limited-overs matches, bowls accurate left-arm spin and is an athletic fielder. England almost chose him for the Test tour of the Caribbean. James Taylor will captain England against Ireland . 'Playing in Dublin would be nerve-wracking because of the exposure,' he said. 'But when it comes to one-day cricket, I feel the gap between international and county cricket maybe isn't as big as between Test cricket and the second division.' Ansari's rise was accelerated by his five-wicket haul for Cambridge MCCU against Surrey back in 2011, when he removed Kevin Pietersen for 30 and helped the students to a 10-wicket win. Pietersen, now a county team-mate, was going through a difficult patch against left-arm spinners, but Ansari insists the pair have not spoken about the dismissal. 'It's never come up,' he said. 'I don't know if it was a touchy issue for him at the time, but it was a touchy issue in general. Anyone could have got him out \u2013 it just happened to be me.' Ansari spent three weeks in Sri Lanka over the winter with England Performance Programme, where he talked about the art of left-handed batting with Adam Lyth and Gary Ballance, and life as a spin bowler with Stephen Parry, Adil Rashid and Adam Riley. He is juggling his time between playing for Surrey and writing up his dissertation at London's Royal Holloway. He doesn't rule out a PhD or a career in academia. If so, he would follow the path of his father, Khizar, who hails from Lahore in Pakistan, settled in England in his teens because his own father was an engineer in the British Army, and was awarded an OBE 13 years ago for his work on race relations. Zafar's English mother is a historian. Between now and May 8, the dissertation may have to wait its turn. 'I'd love to give it a go with England,' he said. 'Things can happen quickly. A couple of good performances and it starts to snowball.' Lewis Gregory . A promising seam bowler who can bat a bit, the 22-year-old Gregory emerged through the ranks of Devon cricket before joining Somerset. Took 43 Championship wickets last season at an average of 26. Has also captained England Under 19s. David Willey . Northamptonshire's seam-bowling all-rounder was man of the match in the final of the 2013 domestic Twenty20 tournament. Son of former England all-rounder Peter, he celebrated his call-up with a typically hard-hitting fifty against Leicestershire. He's a left-armer too, which is all the rage after the World Cup. His county captain Alex Wakely reckons he's 'the Northants Botham'. Sam Billings . An explosive keeper-batsman at Kent, the 23-year-old Billings thrashed 458 runs in last season's Royal London One-Day Cup at an average of 114 and a strike-rate of 154.

The Prime Minister's wife showed her support of UK business by sporting a thoroughly British outfit at the\u00a0Conservative Party's manifesto launch in Swindon. Wearing a simple but elegant \u00a3185 emerald green wrap dress by London-based designer The Fold, Mrs Cameron looked every inch the First Lady of British politics as she arrived at the town's University Technical Colleges.

A vision in green: Sam Cam (centre) adds a dash of glamour as she applauds her husband while seated between George Osborne (right) and William Hague (left) All smiles: Samantha laughs at one of the Prime Minister's more jovial points . Sam Cam, 43, a huge fan of British designers, showed her commitment to UK brands once again by plumping for the Hampton dress. The midi dress with cap sleeves and narrow V-neck is made from a non-crease poly twill fabric, perfect for a woman travelling a lot - and a busy mother-of-four. The look was finished with a slim white belt to accentuate Samantha's enviable waistline and a pair of black heels. The company behind the frock has a flagship store in Clerkenwell and was founded by Polly McMaster. The label specialises in contemporary work-wear. Their collection is designed with 'modern, professional women in mind' which makes them an ideal fit for Sam Cam. Other celebrity fans include Davina McCall and Amanda Holden.

Sam, who appeared to have caught some Easter sun, showed off tanned legs and arms, but kept her make-up simple with some subtle berry lipstick. Jewellery was a pair of gold hoops and a slim gold chain bracelet. The Prime Minister's wife recently showcased another element of her style - her taste in interiors, as a series of pictures of the Cameron's kitchen dining room were released, along with their 1950s retro-chic sofas and chairs and a funky steel lamp stretching over the table. Promises: Mr Cameron took to the lectern to talk about the Tory party's intentions including doubling free childcare for working parents . Listening intently: Samantha looked comfortable in her emerald green wrap dress . Today, she sat, the proverbial rose between two thorns, next to George Osborne and William Hague, listening intently as her husband took to the stage to outline his party's key policies ahead of the general election on May 7. In launching his manifesto, Mr Cameron promised voters 'the good life' as he vowed to double free childcare for working parents and guarantee workers on the minimum wage will never pay income tax. David had Sam's full attention and she only paused to smile, exchange some knowing looks with the Chancellor and to applaud. She also laughed heartily to the PM's jokes and smiled broadly at other times, although occasionally pausing to adjust her long bob. After the speech was over she and her husband left hand in hand, with Sam almost appearing to lead Dave. View from the back: David and Samantha make their way out of the venue .

During the speech, Cameron claimed Britain is 'on the brink of something special' as he unveiled a cradle-to-grave Conservative manifesto, promising voters 'security at every stage of your life'. The Prime Minister warned there is 'almost nothing without economic security' as he set out an extension of Margaret Thatcher's hugely popular Right to Buy scheme, vowed to scrap inheritance tax on homes worth up to \u00a31million and promised to freeze rail fares for five years.

The Scottish First Minister talked up her chances of being Westminster's king-maker following next week's election, with polls still pointing to another hung parliament. Mr Miliband tonight ruled out a formal deal with the resurgent Nationalists, but a vote-by-vote arrangement remains on the table. Scroll down for video . Nicola Sturgeon faced questions from a studio audience at BBC Scotland in Glasgow this evening - immediately after the three main Westminster party leaders faced off in Leeds . Miss Sturgeon's comments came just days after her predecessor Alex Salmond was caught boasting: 'I'm writing Labour's Budget.' The SNP wants to end the Tory-Lib Dem austerity programme and delay plans to balance Britain's books by spending an extra \u00a3140billion over the lifetime of the next parliament. Miss Sturgeon believes the coalition's fixed term parliaments legislation will strengthen the SNP's hand. It means general elections are held on a fixed timetable every five years, and makes it much harder for an election to happen at other times. Two-thirds of MPs now have to back an earlier election, and governments can lose votes on Budgets, Queen's Speeches and other key legislation without it being seen as a vote of no confidence and triggering an election. '[Mr Miliband] will not be able to get policies through without winning support from other parties,' she said last night in a Question Time-style programme on BBC Scotland. 'He won't get his Budget through unless he compromises.' The Scottish First Minister talked up her chances of being Westminster's king-maker following next week's election, with polls still pointing to another hung parliament . Ms Sturgeon's remarks come after the former home secretary David Blunkett admitted that Labour could not win a majority because of the SNP surge in Scotland. He said: 'We have a situation where Labour could win literally scores of seats in England and Wales and see themselves unable to offer a majority Labour government because of what's happened in just one part of the United Kingdom.' Mr Miliband tonight insisted he would not do any deals with the SNP - and claimed he would rather not form a government than team up with Ms Sturgeon's party. The Labour leader's hopes of outright victory on May 7 have been shattered by an extraordinary surge in support for the SNP since the referendum in September saw Scots reject independence. Labour leader Ed Miliband, speaking in tonight's special BBC Question Time, said he would rather not be Prime Minister than make a deal with the SNP . David Cameron, appearing on the special BBC programme first, said he only needed 23 seats to win a majority . Ms Sturgeon, who replaced Alex Salmond after the No vote, has vowed to use her gains in the election to 'lock' the Tories out of power and prop up a Labour administration. An Ipsos Mori poll for STV News found support for the nationalists at 54 per cent while Scottish Labour had slipped to 20 per cent. Mr Miliband sought to dismiss the idea that he would be propped up by the SNP: 'We are not going to do a deal with the Scottish National Party. 'If it meant we would not be in government. then so be it. I'm not going to give in to SNP demands - whether that is on Trident or on the deficit. We do want to put forward a Labour Queen's speech.' But Ms Sturgeon said: 'If we have a big team of SNP MPs we can exercise real clout on behalf of Scotland, but we can also build alliances with others in other parts of the UK to get more progressive policies because I think Westminster needs shaken up for everybody.' She added: 'In the House of Commons now\u2026 you can defeat governments, you can change the direction of governments without bringing governments down. 'That gives the opposition parties enormous clout. 'Now I know that David Cameron and Ed Miliband are clinging to the pretence that one of the other of them is going to get a majority, but all the polls say \u2013 and everybody else knows \u2013 they're not. 'And after the votes are counted, they're frankly going to have to wake up and smell the coffee and respect the outcome of the election.' David Cameron faced a series of tough questions from the Yorkshire audience at the BBC Question Time programme hosted by David Dimbleby (left) Labour leader Ed Miliband faced a series of brutal questions over Labour's economic record - but insisted the party had not spent too much . The SNP has declared it will never support the Conservatives in a hung Parliament, but is ready to do a deal with Labour, even if it finishes in second place. It would be the first time since 1924 that a second-placed party had formed a government. Earlier this month, secret video footage of Mr Salmond raised new fears about the Nationalists holding the balance of power at Westminster after May 7. At a fundraising event in the Highlands filmed on April 13, Mr Salmond, who is bidding to return to the Commons, is heard mocking Labour after Chuka Umunna, Shadow Business Secretary, had slapped down Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy and said: 'The leader of the Scottish Labour party will not be in charge of the UK budget.' Mr Salmond joked to the audience: 'But then I knew that already, because I'm writing the Labour party budget.' Mr MIliband has insisted Labour will be writing its own Budget.\n"]}

But Elvis Presley\u2019s planes are to be taken from the grounds of his former mansion after local officials signed off the controversial deal. Memphis City Council agreed yesterday that Hound Dog II and Lisa Marie \u2013 named after the King of Rock \u2018n\u2019 Roll\u2019s daughter \u2013 can be moved from his estate to a site nearby. It means tourists to Graceland will have to pay extra if they want to see the two jets, which are to form a new, separate museum about the dead singer. Graceland visitors can currently buy a ticket that includes a tour of Presley's home-turned-museum and the interiors of the two planes. They have been at the estate since the mid-1980s after Graceland\u2019s managing company, Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE), agreed that the planes\u2019 owner, OKC Partnership, could have a cut of Graceland ticket sales. OKC spokesman Tim McCaskill told Memphis City Council this week that the goal was for construction work at the planes\u2019 new home to be finished in time for them to be moved there for Elvis Week in August. The site is on the same street as Graceland. Big hit: The Lisa Marie, pictured in the grounds of Graceland, was given a major overhaul by Elvis . Hound Dog II: The smaller jet was used by the star during Lisa Marie's refit and was also his back-up plane . OKC has been in a lengthy dispute with EPE, which was bought by New York-based Authentic Brands Group in 2013. Last April, EPE sent a letter to OKC, saying it was exercising its option to end their agreement and asking OKC \u2018to make arrangements for the removal of the airplanes and the restoration of the site on or shortly after April 26, 2015\u2019. At one stage, Elvis\u2019s former wife Priscilla stepped into the heated row - telling fans who were outraged at the prospect of the planes being moved to \u2018calm down\u2019. Elvis's bedroom: The Lisa Marie had a custom-made, queen-sized bed for the star, who liked to fly at night . Perfectly preserved: A table and chairs in the plane. The seats are now covered in plastic to protect them . Lounge in the sky: There are four TVs in total plus a videotape system in the Lisa Marie . Hot on design: Presley, who oversaw the plane's refurbishment, insisted on gold bathroom taps . Then last September, OKC put them up for sale, saying if they couldn\u2019t stay at Elvis\u2019s former home, they would have to be sold. OKC owner KG Coker, 77, said at the time: \u2018I would love to see the airplanes stay where they are forever. \u2018Millions of fans have toured those airplanes and there's a real connection between fans and those airplanes. They are part of the Elvis experience.\u2019 The jets were expected to fetch $15million in an auction in January. But they were withdrawn from sale, and OKC made arrangements to have them displayed on land adjacent to Graceland. Hound Dog II was bought by Elvis for $900,000 in September 1975 \u2013 less than two years before his death. In November 1975 he paid $250,000 for the larger but secondhand plane Lisa Marie, and spent at least $300,000 having it renovated. He would use Hound Dog II - a Lockheed Jetstar - to fly to Lisa Marie\u2019s hangar to see how the refit was going. When it was finished, Hound Dog II became his back-up jet. Both planes were sold after the singer\u2019s death in August 1977 and bought a few years later by OKC. The Lisa Marie was installed at Graceland in 1984 and the Hound Dog II soon afterwards. Small but comfortable: The eye-catching lime-green and yellow seats in Elvis's Hound Dog II jet . Current home: The jets have been at Graceland since the 1980s, where they have their own entrance (right) Heated debate: Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla Presley joined in the row over whether the planes should stay at Graceland with this tweet to his fans last year. She turned the home into a tourist destination after he died . The Lisa Marie was bought by Elvis from Delta Air Lines in November 1975 for $250,000. It was originally built in 1960, and the singer spent at least $300,000 having the interior overhauled to suit his tastes. He gave it a penthouse-style bedroom with a queen-size bed and in-flight library, an executive conference room finished in teak - and a bathroom with gold sink and taps. The plane also had a bar, four TVs with a videotape system and a state-of-the-art stereo system with 52 speakers. Elvis had the plane painted red, white and blue with his motto TCB - for 'Takin' Care of Business' - on the tail.\u00a0It was decked out by a team that had previously designed the US president\u2019s plane, Air Force One. During the refurbishment, the Lisa Marie was in a hangar in Fort Worth. Elvis took great pleasure in flying friends there in his smaller Hound Dog II jet to check on the progress of the refit, which he personally oversaw. The Lisa Marie - a four-engine 28-passenger Convair - could fly Presley up to 3,000 miles (4,800km).\u00a0On each flight there would typically be three crew members.\u00a0It could hold a maximum of 29 people but usually there would be around eight. The custom-made bed was particularly important to Elvis as he preferred to travel by night. The last journey the plane made for the family was in August 1977 when it transported Elvis's ex-wife Priscilla and his good friend George Hamilton from California to his funeral at Graceland.

But the biggest name likely to be in attendance at Dunblane Cathedral, where the couple are tying the knot, is one-time British tennis star Tim Henman. Indeed, when the sport's world number one, Novak Djokovic, was asked by a journalist recently if he would be attending the celebration, he replied with a curt: 'Not invited', before following up with a more charitable: 'But I wish him all the best.' As one of Murray's fiercest rivals on the court, it's not surprising Djokovic isn't at the top of the guest list but it seems that, unlike a lot of famous faces, the couple have taken a more low-key approach when it comes to who to invite. Murray has said: 'There won't be any celebrities as such. 'I don't have any celebrity friends so it wasn't something that was planned. '[It'll be] Everyone who we're close to, people we've spent a lot of time with in the past but also people we see ourselves spending time with in the future. 'That's how we came up with the names. Pretty much everything is done now and under control. I'm sure a few things will come up next week but it's pretty much sorted.' Who made the list? British player Jamie Delgado (left) is a close friend of Murray's but celebrity pals such as James Corden (right), who admittedly may well have other fish to fry in the US, won't be attending . There will be names from the tennis world in attendance but certainly not players who are as well known as the likes of Nadal or Federer. Murray has invited Dutch doubles player Jules Rojer, who he spends time with while training in Miami and Davis Cup team mate James Ward. Another British pro Jamie Delgado will also attend.

For the 27-year-old\u2019s many fans and friends in the town, it means at least part of the wedding of the year will be a spectator sport, played out on the streets of the community. It is understood local residents and businesses urged the former Wimbledon champion to hold the April 11 service at the cathedral rather than at luxury hotel Cromlix House in nearby Kinbuck \u2013 so they too could toast his big day.

David Duane Watson, a 46-year-old Tucson firefighter, was arrested without incident Saturday on charges he killed his ex-wife\u00a0Linda Watson, 35, in what detectives say motivated by a custody dispute over their daughter. Police say the dispute continued after Watson's murder as her mother\u00a0Marilyn Cox, 63, tried to obtain visitation rights. Three years after her daughter went missing, Cox and her neighbor\u00a0Renee Farnsworth, 53, were shot dead in the driveway of Linda Watson's home.

Seen here upon his arrest late Saturday, David Watson has been charged in the murder of his ex-wife, ex mother-in-law and an innocent neighbor . Police said at a press conference on Saturday that Mr. Watson had been the prime suspect in the murders from the start, reports the Arizona Daily Star. Watson has been charged in all three homicides, with police cited DNA evidence. Chief Deputy Chris Nanos said sheriffs never gave up on the cases, writes Tucson News Now. 'It just goes to show you that the men and women of this department are bulldogs,' said Nanos. 'We'll keep tracking you, we'll find you and you will get punished for the crimes you do.' Linda Watson was reported missing in August 2000 after she failed to pick up her daughter from the home of David Watson.

She--along with the girl's paternal grandfather--was granted visitation rights for her granddaughter. However, Cox said at the time that Watson obstructed those rights, so she petitioned for a review. In May 2003, with another custody battle heating up, Cox was shot dead in a drive-by shooting in the driveway of the home from which her daughter had disappeared years before. Her neighbor, Renee Farnsworth, was also killed in the shooting. Meanwhile. Linda would not officially be declared dead until 2006.

{"question_id": 732, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: A little boy has undergone more than 50 operations to have his entire face painstakingly rebuilt. Billy Mitchell, now seven, was born with Apert syndrome, a rare condition which left him with malformations of the skull, face, hands and feet. He endured a series of major operations to correct the deformities \u2013 which included a procedure to crack open and reshape his skull and another to rebuild his features. He also had a titanium frame drilled into his head, which was left there for nine weeks. Billy Mitchell, seven, was born with Apert syndrome, a rare genetic condition which causes malformations . The surgeries carried risks including meningitis, brain damage, catastrophic bleeding leading to stroke and potentially death, but Billy pulled through and now his parents say he absolutely loves his new face. Billy\u2019s mother, Denise Mitchell, 47, said she knew immediately something was wrong with her son when he was born. \u2018When I saw him I had an overwhelming sense of love. But he looked so ill and his skin appeared plastic and his head was misshapen,\u2019 she said. \u2018I also noticed his fingers and toes were sewn together.\u2019 It was then a doctor broke the news he suspected Billy had Apert syndrome, a genetic abnormality where the bone plates in the skull fuse too early in the womb so the skull is unable to grow normally. The condition is caused by a chromosomal defect. Children with Apert have bulging eyes that are usually wide-set and tilted down at the sides. They may also have problems with tooth alignment due to jaw development problems, suffer from a cleft palate, and may have webbed fingers and toes. After his birth, doctors feared Billy would not last the night. The next day Mr and Mrs Mitchell, who live in Hertfordshire, were forced to have a heartbreaking conversation with doctors about turning off his life support machine. Specialists feared Billy's nose was totally blocked with misformed and premature fused bone, blocking his airway. Billy, pictured with his twin sister Lois, has undergone more than 50 operations to have his face rebuilt . But miraculously, Billy held  on, and in the morning he was transferred to a specialist children\u2019s hospital where he had thin, metal tubes called stents inserted into his nose to help him breathe. He remained in a critical condition, surrounded by tubes and machines. Finally, when he was a month old, Mr and Mrs Mitchell were able to take him home to join his twin sister Lois and older sister Darcy, then five. But he often stopped breathing in the night, and at 10 weeks old Mrs Mitchell heard him crying. Apert syndrome is a genetic craniofacial abnormality that occurs in around one in 160,000 to 200,000 births. The condition is characterised by malformations of the skull, mid-face, hands and feet. The skull is prematurely fused and unable to grow normally. The mid-face - the area from the middle of the eye socket to the upper jaw - appears sunken. Some children with the condition have fused fingers and toes. Early surgery can relieve the pressure that builds up inside the fused skull as the brain grows. And operations can be carried out to re-model a child's face. She noticed that his left eyelid had been pulled behind his eyeball, causing his eye to pop out. After rushing to a doctor, he ended up having his lid sewn shut for a week. Children with Apert syndrome have very small eye orbits, meaning more of their eyeball is exposed. Billy's eye orbits were so shallow, especially the left, that his eye regularly popped out of its socket. Doctors advised Billy have his eyelid sewn together after he developed a corneal ulcer. Just six weeks later, he needed a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain, save his sight and reshape his whole head. Known as a \u2018front orbital advancement\u2019, surgeons opened his skull, detached it, remodelled his forehead and pieced it together again like a jigsaw. They also inserted two pins \u2013 each three inches long \u2013 into his head. For six months, the pins were turned twice a day to create more room inside his head to relieve pressure on his brain. Billy now needs 24-hour care, which has put a strain on family life. Mrs Mitchell said: \u2018Luckily Paul and I had a strong relationship and we talked to each other about how we felt. \u2018But Darcy was still young and had to grow up fast. When Billy was four months old he underwent a major operation to relieve pressure on his brain, save his sight and reshape his whole head . His fingers were also fused together leaving him struggling to clasp things properly. When he was 17 months old surgeons operated on him to separate Billy's fingers and toes down to the first knuckle . \u2018And as for Lois, every time Billy was admitted to hospital, she\u2019d look around wondering where he was. \u2018But she was thriving, passing all the usual milestones. \u2018It was also clear she had a special bond with Billy. Sometimes they\u2019d snuggle up together. \u2018When she learnt to sit up we propped Billy up with cushions and they\u2019d spend ages playing together. And when Lois became mobile she\u2019d fetch Billy his favourite toys.\u2019 Billy\u2019s fingers were fused together \u2013 known as \u2018mitten hands\u2019 \u2013 and so he struggled to clasp things properly. But when he was 17 months old a surgeon at Leeds General Hospital agreed to operate on them. During a nine hour operation, involving bone and skin grafts, he separated Billy\u2019s fingers down to the first knuckle and did the same with his toes. In a second operation he finished the process, separating them fully. Mrs Mitchell said: \u2018Billy had all four limbs in a cast for seven weeks but the results afterwards were amazing. \u2018He grew in confidence overnight and a couple of weeks later learnt to sit up by himself. \u2018Bright as a button he\u2019d would watch Lois intently and began to copy her. As a family we were astounded by his progress. So too were the doctors.\u2019 But the outside world was less understanding, and Mrs Mitchell said people would whisper whenever she took billy out in his pram. \u2018Walking down the street one day I heard one woman say to her friend: \"God he looks awful\". Earlier this year Billy had another major operation which left him with a frame fitted to his face for nine weeks . \u2018I was so upset I went straight home. \u2018Another time when the twins were two and a half we were stood in the queue to see Santa when Darcy noticed some children pointing at Billy. \u2018She told them not to do it because it was rude. Afterwards I overheard their mother saying: \"Well she shouldn\u2019t bring him out should she.\" \u2018If only they knew what Billy was going through.\u2019 But determined not to wrap their child in cotton wool, Mr and Mrs Mitchell sent Billy to nursery and he went to exactly the same school as his twin sister Lois. Despite his difficulties he has turned into a typical little boy, obsessed with cars, reading books, and enjoying playing fancy dress with his sister. Since his most recent surgery, Billy loves his new face, his mother Denise said . \u2018He loved life and was determined to join in with everything,\u2019 Mrs Mitchell says. In the summer of 2012 he underwent more major surgery. During a nine-hour operation surgeons took the left hand side of his skull off to remodel it and put it back with titanium springs to allow for more growth. His condition also left him with a distorted face and his eyes were becoming more and more exposed due to shallow eye sockets and breathing was a struggle. So earlier this year he also underwent high risk mid-face surgery, where his face was literally taken apart, reshaped and put back together again to create more room. His head was cut from ear to ear and his face cut vertically, with the skin being pulled down, exposing all of the bones of his face and jaw. His forehead, eye orbits, nose and top jaw were taken apart, reshaped and put back together with a red frame attached through a series of wires and bolts. The frame was left in place for nine weeks to encourage the bone to grow, as well as pull the existing facial bones forward. The bones were moved forward a millimeter a day by turning the screws on the frame, a process which allows new bone to grow and then to consolidate. Mrs Mitchell said: \u2018So far he\u2019s endured more than 50 general aesthetics and has been through so much. \u2018But since his recent surgery he loves his news face. When he saw it for the first time without the frame I think he would have done cartwheels if he could. \u2018It was a massive boost to his confidence. \u2018And now, a few months on, he doesn\u2019t even associate himself as having Apert syndrome. \u2018But what\u2019s incredible is the way he\u2019s taken everything in his stride. We can\u2019t thank all the doctors and nurses enough who\u2019ve looked after him. '\n"]}

{"question_id": 737, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: The baby, known as Mary, had been born at Alder Hey Hospital in Liverpool, pictured, but died six months later with traces of cocaine in her stomach . A six-month-old baby died with traces of cocaine in her stomach despite her drug-user parents being reported to social services five times. Small amounts of painkiller and anti-depressant drugs were also found in the infant, known as Mary, who died suddenly in 2013, after a lengthy stay in Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Now a review released today has called for a host of lessons to be learned after several agencies fell short in sharing information that could have highlighted the baby's vulnerability. According to a report, Mary's family, who lived in Liverpool, were well-known to social services and had been reported five times amid concerns of alcohol abuse, domestic violence and child neglect. A school had also raised concerns about the way other children in the family were being brought up. Mary was the youngest child in a family of four children born to a mother aged 30 and a father aged 33. At the time of her death, her siblings were one, eight and 10. Her parents came to the attention of social care unit Careline five times between 2008 and 2012. Mary's siblings' school had already raised concerns that the two eldest children were overweight, staying off school and left to look after their baby brother while their parents stayed in bed. Mary was born 12 weeks early at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in January 2013 and was diagnosed with a number of medical conditions, including a heart murmur. She was kept in hospital for three months during which time there were 'several consecutive days' in which she had no contact with her parents. After she was discharged from hospital and into her parents' care, a number of community nurse follow-up visits were scheduled. But the nurse was unable to get access to the family despite visiting them three times in one week. A fourth visit was successful but later appointments were not kept. A day before Mary died in July 2013, a health visitor went to the home but was stopped at the door. A post-mortem revealed the presence 'at very low levels' of cocaine, tramadol and mirtazapine (an anti-depressant) in her stomach. Police also found empty beer cans, drugs and a syringe on the premises and her mother admitted to the police that she used cocaine and cannabis in the home. Because of a lack of evidence, a coroner ruled the cause of Mary\u2019s death was 'unascertained' as it was ruled the traces of drugs, which could have come from the environment or through resuscitation attempts, were not considered to have directly led to her death. A post-mortem revealed the presence of cocaine, pictured, at 'very low levels' as well as tramadol and mirtazapine, an anti depressant (file picture) The report said: 'Whilst agencies had some concerns about the older children, they generally worked to single rather than multi-agency agendas and processes. 'There was some evidence of good informal liaisons such as between the school and the education welfare officer, or the school and school nurse, but generally the level of inter-agency communication required to support a family with four children was not achieved. 'Child Mary was a vulnerable child and a discussion between health professionals may well have highlighted important information about [the mother\u2019s] history of not engaging with health services in respect of her children and the shared information may have led to further action.' But Liverpool Safeguarding Children Board, which compiled the independent report, said it was impossible to tell if the death of baby Mary \u2013 not her real name \u2013 could have been avoided. Chairman Howard Cooper said: 'Predicting the likelihood of such an outcome for a vulnerable baby is difficult to achieve with any meaningful degree of accuracy. 'It cannot be inferred that child Mary\u2019s death was preventable, but there are lessons to be learned for all the agencies involved with this family about multi-agency working.\u201d Mr Cooper said a number of recommendations had been made in the wake of the infant's death to improve working relationships between agencies tasked with supporting vulnerable children and their families.

'In prison, she was threatened with rape from a male guard, it was a really terrible experience,' says Trial By Jury author, Douglas Preston. 'I think it has really affected her, it's really hard to lead a normal life after that.' Scroll down for video . Strain and relief: Amanda Knox spoke outside her parents' home on March 27 flanked by her fianc\u00e9 Colin Sutherland after she was exonerated for the murder of Meredith Kercher in November 2007 . Three weeks after an Italian court overturned her conviction for the 2007 murder of British student, Meredith Kercher, Preston told RadarOnline that Knox is living out a bittersweet victory. 'She went to Italy as a normal 20-year-old, West Coast girl, a soccer player, rock climber, very na\u00efve,' says Preston about Knox's ill-fated adventure to Perugia. 'So many terrible things happened to her in Italy, so many lies were said, and the online savagery directed at her, I've never seen anything like it.' So affected has Knox been by her struggle to be exonerated by the Italian courts, that Preston hinted to RadarOnline that she is suffering PTSD and seeking professional help. 'Anyone who has been through what she's been through is going to have issues. It's like a soldier come back from Iraq, having children shot in front of him, you've been through a horrific experience. If it doesn't affect you physically, it affects you emotionally,' he says to Radar. Family struggle: Amanda Knox stands on the front porch with her fianc\u00e9, her mother Edda Mellas and stepfather, Chris Mellas. According to her biographer, Knox and her family have spent millions fighting her conviction . On top of her fight to be declared innocent, Preston claims that Knox has been ravaged financially by legal fees. This despite receiving a reported $4 million advance for her 2013 book, Waiting To Be Heard. 'The ordeal has been hugely emotional, but the financial impact has been catastrophic,' says Preston. 'Amanda received a $4 million advance for her book, that money has all gone, immediately out of the door to pay legal fees and there is nothing left,' Preston explains. 'She really wants to establish that she's innocent in Italy, they've paid a lot of fees to Italian lawyers.' Knox, 27, fought the Italian legal system for eight years, spent four years in prison and went through three appeals until she and her ex-boyfriend, Raffaele Sollecito were exonerated by the Italian Supreme Court in late March for the murder of Meredith Kercher. Shared experience: This split picture shows Amanda Knox and Raffaele Sollecito, arriving with penitentiary police to a court hearing in Perugia September 26, 2008 . Beginning of her nightmare: Amanda Knox leaves with penitentiary police after a court hearing in Perugia in September 2008 after she and her ex-boyfriend were arrested for the murder of Meredith Kercher . Kercher was discovered in a pool of blood in the house she shared with Kercher in November 2007. The British student had been stabbed four times and her throat slit in what the Italian courts claimed was a sex-game gone wrong. Knox and Sollecito was found guilty of her murder and sentenced to 26 years behind bars, but were acquitted in 2011. Knox immediutely returned to the United States protesting her innocence, but in January 2014, the Italian courts overturned that acquittal and reinstated the guilty verdict. However, the case ultimately went to the Supreme Court and their conviction was overturned. Tears: Amanda Knox breaks down after hearing she had been acquitted of the murder of Meredith Kercher in October, 2011 . Return home: Amanda Knox pauses emotionally while speaking during a news conference at Sea-Tac International Airport, Washington after landing there on a flight from Italy, October 4, 2011 after her acquittal . On the announcement of her innocence, Knox appeared on her Seattle doorstep to make a statement. Surrounded by her father, Curt Knox, mother, Edda Mellas, sister, Deanna Knox, and fianc\u00e9, Colin Sutherland, the 27-year-old broke down in tears as she told the press: 'Meredith was my friend and she deserved so much in this life. I am the lucky one.' Amanda Knox could now receive millions in compensation after being cleared by Italy's top court of murdering Surrey student Meredith Kercher. The 27-year-old and her former lover Raffaele Sollecito both served four years in prison after being convicted of the murder in 2007. It is thought that Knox will return to Italy, despite having vowed never to, and will write about the country's legal and judicial system while she is there. Both Knox and Sollecito are reportedly planning to seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison. Both Knox (above) and Sollecito could now seek compensation for time wrongly spent in prison . While no figures have been revealed, compensation for such cases regularly run into seven figure sums. Carlo Dalla Vedova, her Italian lawyer, confirmed Miss Knox will 'be seeking compensation for wrongful imprisonment,' according to The Telegraph. Mr Sollecito\u2019s father Francesco told the newspaper: 'You could hardly quantify a compensation figure, it has been such an awful business.' She added that she was 'full of joy' following Italy's highest court's decision to overturn her murder conviction, saying: 'I'm incredibly grateful for what has happened. For the justice I have received, for the support I have had from everyone, from my family and my friends to strangers.' Shortly after the verdict, Knox, who has said she would never willingly return to Italy, released a statement, saying she was 'tremendously relieved and grateful' and knowing she was innocent gave her 'strength in the darkest times of this ordeal'. She added: 'Throughout this ordeal, I have received invaluable support from family, friends, and strangers. To them, I say thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your kindness has sustained me.'\n"]}

For sure I wouldn't be here and a lot of these players wouldn't be here if he hadn't done that, so we are thankful to him. 'He should also be thankful that we are in the position we are in, and that the players and myself have got the team where it is, because the reception could have been very different if we were in the relegations zone and leaving so shortly before the season started. I think that is good for him and he deserves that. Hopefully tomorrow he gets the reception that he warrants.'

{"question_id": 741, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Washington (CNN)Chief Justice John Roberts is back in the spotlight. Roberts -- who shocked conservatives nearly three years ago by providing a pivotal vote to uphold Obamacare -- once again faces a judicial crossroads in a historic case. The U.S. Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Tuesday in a case that could decide whether gay and lesbian couples nationwide have the constitutional right to marry. The question at the core of Obergefell v. Hodges is one of the most consequential debates of the early 21st century, and one that is already helping to shape the 2016 presidential race. Appeals courts nationwide have moved decisively toward supporting same-sex marriage, but a split at the appellate level helped propel the issue to the nation's highest court, led by Roberts. Appointed to the bench by President George W. Bush, Roberts has a solid conservative record and would seem an unlikely vote to support a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. He dissented in United States v. Windsor, a landmark case in which a narrowly divided court struck down a key provision of the Defense of Marriage Act, which denied federal benefits to lawfully married same-sex couples. And he's expressed sympathy with legal arguments that would allow same-sex marriage bans. Yet both sides see the case as a legacy-making moment for the 60-year-old chief justice, and advocates for same-sex couples hold out hope that he will emerge as their ally. They will be scrutinizing his words and actions Tuesday for clues about how he'll vote -- and whether he will upset some conservatives once again. \"If the Windsor majority votes in favor of marriage equality, the ruling will be one of the most momentous decisions of the Roberts court,\" said Judith E. Schaeffer of the Constitutional Accountability Center, which is advocating for same-sex marriage. \"Will John Roberts want to be remembered as having dissented from such a historic decision?\" For some conservatives, a vote in favor of same-sex marriage in the case would be a huge disappointment. It would be akin to the type of betrayal they felt when Justice David Souter, who was nominated to the bench by George H.W. Bush and who retired in 2009, consistently voted with the liberals or when Justice Anthony Kennedy, a Ronald Reagan appointee, disappointed them on earlier gay rights cases as well as abortion and the death penalty. Or when Roberts infuriated conservative allies by providing the crucial fifth vote to uphold Obamacare on the grounds that the law is a constitutional use of the government's taxing authority. The hope in conservative circles is that Roberts will see his legacy as ensuring that the issue of same-sex marriage gets decided by the people, not the courts. \"The chief surely knows that his job is to be on the right side of the Constitution,\" said Edward Whelan, president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center. \"Blatherings about the 'wrong side of history' are an appeal to intellectual cowardice.\" Those hoping that he will vote to uphold the state bans see a strong signal in the Windsor case. In his majority opinion, Kennedy said the \"principal purpose\" of the Defense of Marriage Act was to \"impose inequality.\" Roberts disagreed. He wrote separately to say he thought Congress acted constitutionally when it passed the law in 1996 in an attempt to provide \"uniformity and stability\" at a time when every state defined marriage as between a man and a woman. Roberts picked up on Kennedy's language that emphasized the states' power to define the marital relationship and said that power will someday \"come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions.\" David Cruz of the University of Southern California Gould School of Law said that Roberts could use that reasoning to vote in favor of state bans in the Obergefell case. \"Roberts is suggesting that concerns about the powers of states will support state laws excluding same-sex couples from marriage,\" Cruz said. Indeed, the lower court that upheld the marriage bans in Michigan, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky in the Obergefell case relied heavily on the argument that states have a right to define marriage. Another clue to Roberts' thinking in the Windsor dissent is that he took particular issue with any notion that the Defense of Marriage Act was passed out of a desire to harm -- noting it had the support of majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate as well as President Bill Clinton, who signed it into law. \"I would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry,\" Roberts wrote. The comments suggest he would reject an argument in the Obergefell case that rested on the idea that same-sex marriage bans reflected animus against gay people. But backers of same-sex marriage are reading some tea leaves of their own. Schaeffer points out that Roberts didn't join the parts of the dissents penned by Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, which clearly stated a belief that state bans on same-sex marriage don't violate the Constitution. \"Roberts didn't join them in expressing those views,\" Schaeffer said. At the time, Roberts simply wrote that the court \"does not have before it, and the logic of its opinion does not decide\" whether states can ban same-sex marriage. Schaeffer said the chief justice could have simply chosen to remain silent on an issue that wasn't before the court. \"But I think one reasonable explanation is that Roberts was preserving a clean slate for himself on the ultimate issue of marriage equality,\" she said. The Defense of Marriage Act decision overshadowed another 2013 case -- Hollingsworth v. Perry -- that could have determined whether states could ban same-sex marriage. The case concerned a challenge to California's Proposition 8, a state constitutional amendment that barred same-sex couples from marriage. But Roberts, writing for the majority, dismissed the case, holding that the challengers did not have the legal standing to bring it to the court. The ruling left in place a lower court decision that had invalidated Proposition 8 and thus paved the way for same-sex marriage in California. Roberts' lesbian cousin, who lives in California, sat in the courtroom during arguments in the Prop 8 case. Few people predicted that the issue would return so quickly to the Supreme Court, but waves of lower court judges -- sometimes citing Windsor -- struck down the state bans. On the first day of the term last fall, the court was presented with seven different petitions on the issue. Conventional wisdom was that the justices would garner the four necessary votes and grant one of the cases. But conventional wisdom was completely wrong. Without comment, the court declined to take up any of the cases, clearing the way for thousands of additional same-sex marriages. The court's vote count in such decisions is kept a secret and may never be known. But some speculate on one possible scenario: Roberts chose not to provide the fourth vote to the conservatives who dissented in Windsor. Then again, even if the speculation were true, it doesn't reveal much about Roberts' thinking. There's a big difference between voting not to take up a case, which expresses no opinions on the merits, and issuing an opinion on the merits. And even when Roberts' actions -- such as effectively allowing same-sex marriage to proceed in California -- seem to suggest a willingness to consider such unions nationwide, his comments along the way make it much harder to gain insight into his ultimate thinking. \"When the institution of marriage developed historically, people didn't get around and say, 'Let's have this institution, but let's keep out homosexuals,' \" Roberts said during the Proposition 8 oral arguments. \"The institution developed to serve purposes that, by their nature, didn't include homosexual couples.\"\n"]}

She added: 'As a family we always support each other 100 per cent and I know that I see things online that there is this divide and this one doesn\u2019t support this and this one doesn\u2019t support this and you know it\u2019s all ridiculous and it\u2019s all rumors and we love everyone in the family and we support everyone equally so we're excited to watch tonight and I\u2019m excited for Bruce to tell his story on Diane Sawyer.' She added to Entertainment Tonight: 'I hate so badly when I see things [like] my mom doesn't support him, or this sister doesn't support him. It's all just a story that people want to put out there. None of us have spoken and we're letting Bruce speak first.' TMZ claimed that Bruce, 65, would be watching the special twice. 'He will be watching both an east coast and west coast feed,' said a source. 'The Kardashian family will be watching one feed with Bruce, and the rest of his family, including Brody, Brandon, Burt and Casey, will be watching the other feed.' The Jenners will gather at his Malibu mansion. The site's source added, 'Bruce felt it was very important to be around his family when the show airs.' The cameras for Keeping Up with the Kardashians will not be on when he watched the show, it was also claimed. But there was no mention if some of Bruce's own cameras for one of his own projects would be there. On Thursday evening Entertainment Tonight reported that Jenner started a gender transition process in the mid-1980s but stopped after he met and fell in love with Kris Kardashian, who became his third wife. A supporter: The E! queen previously told\u00a0Entertainment Tonight. 'I think Bruce is very happy, the happiest I've ever seen him...He's our dad so we support him no matter what\u2026 I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about' By the mid-1980s, the Olympic gold medalist had allegedly started hormone therapy and electrolysis and had had plastic surgery to make his features look more feminine. Jenner found his own facial hair to be repulsive, the source told ET. A spokesperson for Bruce declined to comment on the report after being contacted by DailyMail.com Friday morning. The bombshell Entertainment Tonight report, broadcast Thursday night, claims that Bruce was exploring the idea of gender reassignment surgery with doctors in Denmark but had a change of heart after meeting Kris, the ex-wife of famed LA attorney Robert Kardashian. Mum's the word on her ex: Kris Jenner would not comment on Bruce's upcoming tell-all when she stopped by Craig's in West Hollywood on Thursday evening . The revelation comes just hours before the famous decathlete and reality star is expected to tell all about his personal journey and his transition to living as a woman in a two-hour ABC special tonight with Diane Sawyer. On Friday morning ABC released another clip from his upcoming sit down. In the emotional video, Sawyer asked Jenner if there was anything that they hadn't covered over the course of the interview. 'What is the question\u2014if I were you, what question would you ask me?' he clarified. 'Right...\"Are you going to be OK? You know? Are you gonna be OK?\"' Not a peep from this trip either: Khloe Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner had nothing to say about the former Olympian when they attended the Calvin Klein Jeans' celebration launch of the #mycalvins Denim Series at Chateau Marmont Thursday . He then said, 'Yeah. I hope I'm gonna be OK. I feel like I'm gonna be OK...2015's gonna be quite a ride. Quite a ride.' Earlier Bruce said he was worried about his children. 'I can't let myself hurt them.' Kim earlier showed support for her stepfather when talking to Entertainment Tonight. 'I will say that I think Bruce should tell his story his way...I think everyone goes through things in life,' she explained. 'I think Bruce is very happy, the happiest I've ever seen him...He's our dad so we support him no matter what\u2026 I guess I'll kind of let everyone be curious and I feel like that's his journey to talk about.'

The cost of paying for rising numbers of deaths as the unprecedented numbers of post-World War Two babies come to the end of their lives may be too much for many families, a report said. It predicted that numbers of deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades. At the same time the price of a funeral is rising fast, thanks to higher costs for cremation, rising undertakers\u2019 bills as funeral firms are faced with bad debts, and the increasing fees demanded by churches. Deaths in Britain, which have been falling for 40 years, will start to go up and increase by 20 per cent over the next two decades, a report by a think tank has found (file photo) The report, prepared by an old age think tank, the International Longevity Centre-UK, and backed by insurance firm OneFamily, suggests that younger people who already feel financially hard pressed in comparison to their parents will still be under money pressure even after their deaths. Younger people are finding it increasingly difficult to afford homes or to start families, and in the long-term their pensions are much less secure than those of their parents, many of whom enjoyed the generous and fast-disappearing defined benefit pension system. The report from ILC-UK to be published next week said that death rates are set to go up following a long period in which medical advances, better diet, healthier lifestyles and the growing unpopularity of smoking, and the decline of dangerous heavy industrial jobs, have meant fewer people have been dying despite a rising population. \u2018After decades of the number of deaths in the UK falling, 2015 will mark a tipping point where the historic trend starts to reverse,\u2019 it said. \u2018As the oldest of the baby boomer generation move through their later years, deaths are predicted to rise by 20 per cent.\u2019 It added: \u2018This will have significant implications for current forecasts of funeral costs and highlights a growing need for families to broach the delicate subject of end of life expenses.\u2019 A 'simple' funeral with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker now costs \u00a33, 590 . Baroness Sally Greengross of ILC-UK said: \u2018More than half of UK households have less than \u00a33,000 in savings and many will struggle to cover funeral costs. \u2018We all need to talk more about dying and ensure we are prepared for the inevitable. State support for funerals is complex and inadequate and without reforms will contribute to more people falling victim to funeral debt.\u2019 The report said that funeral costs have already risen by 80 per cent over the past 10 years and costs are set to go up further. A \u2018simple\u2019 funeral, with a cremation, a minister and an undertaker, now costs an average of \u00a33,590, it found. However a family that wants to throw in a memorial stone, death notices, flowers, limousines, a wake and somewhere to hold it, is likely to be looking at spending almost \u00a32,000 more. An average \u2018full works\u2019 funeral now costs \u00a35,423, the report said. Costs are going up, it found, partly for technical reasons. Crematoria now need to cover costs for removing fillings from the teeth of the dead, for example, because they must remove mercury from the body before disposal. Funeral firms are under growing costs pressures, not least because some families cannot or will not pay their bills, and the fees for a Church of England vicar to conduct the funeral went up in 2013 from \u00a3102 to \u00a3160. More than one in five families do not have money left by the deceased to help with the cost of the funeral, the report said.\n"]}

Oliver Minatel, 22, said he was sleeping on Air Canada Flight 8623 from Toronto when he felt something around his neck. \"With a rope, something that he has, he just jumped on me. That's what happened,\" Minatel told CNN's Paula Newton moments after the incident. She was seated four rows behind Minatel, a professional soccer player traveling with his team. The incident occurred about a half-hour before the flight landed, after the pilots had begun their descent. \"I forced it (the cord) down and then other people came to help, and then I got out and he started saying that we were here to kill him,\" Minatel said. The man was not restrained for the rest of the trip, but the flight crew told him to stay seated with his seat belt on. The man kept trying to get out of his seat but other passengers yelled at him whenever he tried to stand up. The two-hour flight landed at Atlanta's Hartsfield airport at about 4:30 p.m.  where it was met by U.S. authorities.  The suspect was escorted off the plane. An FBI spokesman confirmed the agency responded to the incident. \"The passenger, however, was transported for medical/mental evaluation under the direction and coordination of the Atlanta Police Department,\" Special Agent Stephen Emmett said. \"While there are currently no federal charges pending, the facts of the matter are being relayed to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta.\" Minatel, a forward from Brazil, was traveling with his teammates from the Ottawa Fury Football Club of the second-division North American Soccer League.  They are scheduled to play the Atlanta Silverbacks on Saturday. \"We're very thankful to everyone who came to the aid of Oliver and relieved that he's O.K. and ready to play in our game,\" Fury FC Head Coach Marc Dos Santos said in a statement posted on the team's website. Several witnesses said they saw the suspect try to choke Minatel with the cord of his headphones. Kevin Kerr says he was seated next to the suspect. \"He was talking about how this soccer team was trying to kill him. I thought he was maybe a deranged fan,\" said Kerr. Kerr said he fell asleep and he awakened to see the suspect trying to choke Minatel. \"I assisted to make sure that didn't happen,\" Kerr said. The Canadian businessman said he and members of the soccer team kept a close eye on the suspect as the plane landed to make sure he did not threaten other passengers.\n"]}
{"question_id": 750, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Anaesthetic gases used to send patients to sleep during surgery are accumulating in the Earth's atmosphere where they are contributing to climate change. Scientists say they have detected the gases used in anaesthetic as far a field as Antarctica and concentrations have been rising globally in the past decade. The gases - desflurane, isoflurane and sevoflurane - are potent greenhouse gases that have 2,500 times the impact on global warming compared to carbon dioxide. Anaesthetic is used to send patients to sleep during surgery (above) but it may also be warming the planet . Atmospheric scientists who have been monitoring the gases say that while the concentrations in the atmosphere are low, they are having an increasing effect on the climate. Dr Martin Vollmer, who led the study at the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Material Science and Technology in Dubendorf, Switzerland, said the anaesthetic gases were capable of storing far more energy from the sun than carbon dioxide. The world needs to prepare itself for a rapid increase in the speed of climate change, scientists have warned. Researchers have found evidence that suggests the rate at which temperatures are rising in the northern hemisphere could be 0.25\u00b0C per decade by 2020 - a level not seen for at least 1,000 years. The analysis, based on a combination of data from more than two dozen climate simulation models from around the world, looked at the rate of change in 40-year long time spans. Over the 900 years preceding the 20th century, 40-year warming trends rarely showed an average rate much higher than 0.1\u00b0C per decade, the study found. But by 2020 the rate was expected to have risen to an average of 0.25\u00b0C per decade, give or take 0.05\u00b0C. Different scenarios of future emissions showed that even at the lower end of greenhouse gas generation climate change picked up speed in the next 40 years. He said: 'On a kilogram-per-kilogram basis, it's so much more poten . 'Modern halogenated inhalation anesthetics undergo little metabolisation during clinical application and evaporate almost completely to the atmosphere.' The researchers, whose work is published in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, found that concentrations of desflurane reached 0.30 parts per trillion in 2014. Isoflurane, sevoflurane and halothane have reached 0.097, 0.13 and 0.0092 parts per trillion in the atmosphere respectively. By comparison, carbon dioxide gas currently makes up 400 parts per million in the atmosphere. However, one kilogram (2.2lbs) of desflurane produces the same greenhouse effect as 2,500 kg (5,512lbs) of carbon dioxide. The researchers estimate that anaesthetic gas emissions currently combine to produce the equivalent effect in the atmosphere of 3.1 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. The research team did not examine the impact of nitrous oxide, another major component of anaesthetic, as it is released by many other sources. The researchers have been taking air samples from remote sites around the Northern Hemisphere since 2000 while they have also obtained air samples in the North Pacific and the South Shetland Islands in Antarctic. The gases escape through vents in operating rooms (pictured) when breathed out by patients and from masks . The team also used two hourly measurements at a high altitude observatory at Jungfraujoch, Switzerland since 2013 to track anaesthetic gases. They then used computer modelling to produce global estimates for the concentrations of these gases. The gases escape from hospital operating rooms via air vents during surgery. An estimated 280 tonnes of anaesthetic gases are used every year. Jodi Sherman, an anaesthesiologist at Yale University who reviewed the paper, said hospitals should consider using other chemicals in anaesthetic. She said: 'There's nothing unique about desflurane that we can't do with other drugs. 'Desflurane we could live without, and every little bit makes a difference. 'Health care in and of itself in the US is one of the worst polluting industries. Scientists say that hospitals should consider alternative anaesthetics when performing operations like above . 'It generates eight percent of US greenhouse gases according to one study. 'Add to this the fact that climate change has been recognized by the World Health Organization as the number one health issue of the 21st century, and it behooves us to do a better job with emissions.' However, Edmond Eger, an anaethesiologist at the University of California San Francisco, said: 'What the report fails to note is that a major factor determining the environmental effect is the manner in which the anesthetics are used. 'Many anesthetists deliver sevoflurane or isoflurane in a two - three liters per minute flow but deliver desflurane in a lower flow - 0.5 to one liter per minute. 'Some believe that desflurane has clinical advantages that argue for its continued use.'\n"]}

Aeman Presley, 34, faces charges for the killing of two homeless men in Atlanta, another man sleeping outdoors in DeKalb County and a hairdresser in a parking garage in Decatur. Presley is set to appear in front of a DeKalb County judge today and district attorneys in both DeKalb County and Fulton County have said they will seek the death penalty. Bloodlust: Aeman Presley (center), 34, who allegedly killed four people had originally set out to rob his victims but was overcome with 'bloodlust' after killing the first man . An investigator for the Fulton County district attorney's office detailed Presley's slide and eventual turn to violence in court documents. The man had taken a Greyhound bus from Los Angeles to Atlanta last May 'hoping to rejuvenate his beleaguered acting career,' according to a sworn statement by the investigator. At first, Presley settled into a homeless shelter in Atlanta and worked small food service jobs, but when his money ran low, he bought a Taurus .45 revolver 'on the street' to use in robberies, the statement said. On September 26, Presley took a bus to DeKalb County with the intent of finding people to rob, according to documents filed in court. He came upon 53-year-old Calvin Gholston sleeping beneath a shopping center breezeway, firing three shots that killed him, the statement said. That incident produced 'a self-described adrenaline fueled high,' according to the statement. 'This high manifested into a \"bloodlust\" which compelled Presley to commit two more murders in Fulton County.' Targeted: After Presley killed Calvin Gholston (left), 53, he felt a 'self-described adrenaline fueled high' and went on to shoot Dorian Jenkins (right), 42, while he slept on the sidewalk in November . Tragic: 68-year-old Tommy Mims (left) was shot while sleeping under a railway bridge while 44-year-old Karen Pearce (right) was killed in a parking garage on her way home from dinner . Having apparently abandoned plans for robbing strangers, Presley found Dorian Jenkins, 42, sleeping on a sidewalk under several blankets and killed him on November 23, the statement said. Wanted: After killing Pearce, Presley said he decided he did not want to continue killing and tried to go back to a career in acting, before getting arrested for jumping a turnstile . A few days later, he killed 68-year-old Tommy Mims as he slept under a railway bridge, later coming across two other homeless men he considered killing before deciding it would be too risky, according to the statement. 'Since he was \"getting off on killing people,\" he wanted to kill them, too,' the statement said. 'He decided, however, that doing so would increase his chances of apprehension.' He instead turned around and went back to where he shot Mims, believing he had not killed him, and shot him twice more in the head, according to the statement. Presley was in Decatur on December 6 and found 44-year-old Karen Pearce walking alone on her way back from dinner with friends. He ordered her to hand over her wallet at gunpoint, which she did, though Presley still shot her once in the chest, killing her, according to the statement. After Pearce died, Presley said he didn't have the same feeling of adrenaline, and later told investigators he had never wanted to kill a woman. He then tried to return to acting, and was on his way to get headshots taken on December 11 when he was arrested for going through a train station turnstile without paying. During an hours-long interview by Atlanta police detective David Quinn, Presley said he didn't think he was 'a biologically malevolent person.' Some events of his life, including his father's early death and mother's illness contributed to a 'murderous spirit,' along with, Presley said, membership in Chicago's Gangster Disciples and rap lyrics.\n"]}

Sportsmail can reveal that is the unswerving message from the world's most expensive player. And it is one that is not set to change regardless of how persistent the rumours of a possible switch to Manchester United become. Bale is injured and out of Wednesday's Euroderby II showdown with Atletico Madrid. Carlo Ancelotti has already gone on record as to just how important he believes the Welshman is to Real Madrid. Gareth Bale is adamant that he wants to stay at Real Madrid despite strong interest from Manchester United . Bale has scored 17 goals for Real this season but has still bee criticised by supporters . Bale holds off the challenge of Atletico forward Raul Garcia during Champions League quarter-final . He said last week: 'He had a fantastic season last year and he is having a very good season this time. He did very well for us in the finals that we played and we need him for this season's run-in too.' Real Madrid's \u00a386million player is hoping to be back in time for the Champions League semi-finals should the holders qualify. His future continues to be the source of much speculation with Manchester United desperate to make a signing that would send shockwaves throughout world football and immediately install them as favourites to win the Premier League next season. Real Madrid have also privately declared their interest in making David de Gea the long-term successor to Iker Casillas, just as he is expected to be in the Spain side. Bale is out of Real's Champions League quarter-final second leg against Atletico on Wednesday . The Wales international injured his calf during Saturday's 3-1 win against Malaga after just two minutes . The possibility of a Bale-plus-cash move for De Gea this summer would certainly suit United and please those Real Madrid supporters who fail to see the value of Bale and those goals that won the club three trophies last year, but the player remains adamant that his future is in Madrid. In nearly all transfer wrangles the player gets what he wants over and above the desires of the clubs involved and it seems highly unlikely that he will be wearing anything other than a white shirt next season such is his desire to ride out the storm in Madrid. He had a sensational first season in Spain winning four trophies and scoring in the Copa del Rey, Champions League and World Club Cup finals. This season he has been the target of some post-decima criticism and even booed at times in his own stadium but he is determined to win over fans who have jeered some of the greatest players in history in their time. Bale enjoyed a standout first season in Madrid and won the Champions League and the Copa del Rey . The former Tottenham star scored a decisive goal in extra-time during the Champions League final last season . He wants to emulate Cristiano Ronaldo, who also had to change the minds of the disgruntled masses, and to eventually follow in his Ballon d'Or footsteps. At the moment Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are a considerable cut above everything else in football but Bale sees himself up against Barcelona's Neymar as the young pretenders trying to dethrone football's greatest. In the Spanish capital, while no one expects him to leave this summer, nobody sees Bale's desire to stay put as something that would necessarily prevent De Gea from arriving at the Santiago Bernabeu at the end of the season to become his team-mate. Carlo Ancelotti said recently that if the club acquired a better goalkeeper than Casillas then the Spain international would lose his place and De Gea is the man most supporters and the club directors identify as the one keeper who would justify the coach leaving out the legend. Real Madrid would like to sign Manchester United goalkeeper to be long-term successor to Iker Casillas . De Gea punches clear under a challenge from John Terry during Saturday's defeat by Chelsea . De Gea's girlfriend continues to live in Madrid and her recent unflattering comments about Manchester did little to quell rumours that family pressures are being applied on the keeper to return to Spain. He appears no closer to signing a new contract and last year Louis van Gaal made sure he installed Victor Valdes - a keeper he knows from his Barcelona days - as De Gea's No 2. Valdes was given his debut by the Dutchman and stories coming out of Old Trafford suggest that for all his heroic shot stopping, Van Gaal does not see De Gea as in anyway irreplaceable. De Gea spent one season in the Atletico first team before joining United in 2011 for \u00a318million . All that points to the possibility of a return to Madrid where he previously represented Atletico but left after only one season in the first team. Despite his Atletico past he has none of the emotional pull that Fernando Torres once had leading him to declare he would never play for Real. The supporters would welcome him. Currently if they had to choose between De Gea and Bale they would opt for the goalkeeper providing there was a considerable cash bonus for sending Bale back to Britain. But they don't believe it will be necessary. They see both men lining-up for them next season. Bale's desire to stay in Spain will keep him at Madrid. It only remains to be seen just how much De Gea wants to join him in the Spanish capital.\n"]}

The couple, who have two teenage daughters,\u00a0met when Fualaau was in her second grade class in Seattle. She then taught him again in sixth grade in 1996. Speaking to Walters, Letourneau said they began to spend more time together as she helped him develop his drawing skills that school year and by the summer, their relationship turned sexual. Scroll down for video . Family affair: Mary Kay Letourneau,\u00a0Vili Fualaau, and their two daughters, Audrey and Georgia, sat down for an interview with Barbara Walters on the eve of the couple's 10-year wedding anniversary . Speaking out: The interview will air on 20/20 on Friday - nearly 20 years after\u00a0Letourneau's arrest for the relationship with her former student. She was his sixth grade teacher when their affair began . 'The incident was a late night that it didn't stop with a kiss,' Letourneau recounted. 'And I thought that it would and it didn't.' When asked how Letourneau - then a married mother to four young children - felt about the affair, she responded: 'I loved him very much, and I kind of thought, \"why can't it ever just be a kiss?\"' But it didn't stop there and by the end of the summer, she had fallen pregnant with the boy's child. Months later, her husband discovered a love letter she had written to Fualaau and he contacted police. She was arrested and gave birth to their first daughter while on bail in May 1997. Following a highly-publicized trial, she was sentenced to six months in county jail - although three were suspended - and was ordered to have no contact with the boy. But weeks after her release, she was found having sex with him in her car and fell pregnant with their second daughter. Struggles: The couple said they have had their ups and downs but had a solid relationship to start with . Relationship: The duo first met when\u00a0Fualaau (pictured in 1998) was in second grade and went on to have a sexual relationship when he was 12 and\u00a0Letourneau (right in a 1996 school photo) was his teacher . Letourneau gave birth to the second baby girl, Georgia, while she was in jail after being sentenced to an additional seven-and-a-half years behind bars. Being a father at such a young age and bringing up the girls without Letourneau was a struggle, Fualaau said in the interview. He slipped into a depression over the years, he said. 'I don't feel like I had the right support or the right help behind me,' he said. 'From my family, from anyone in general. I mean, my friends couldn't help me because they had no idea what, what it was like to be a parent, I mean, because we were all 14, 15.' He was not allowed to visit Letourneau while she was in prison but he believes contact with her would've helped him. She was the only person he really needed to talk to, he said. 'I mean, if they gave me more options or choices to make instead of just saying, \"Oh, you can't talk to her anymore,\" and I was like, \"I really do want to talk to her, though\",' he said. In court: She is pictured left in court in 1997 - she ultimately went to prison for seven and a half years - and right proudly showing off her baby bump in a pregnancy photo released in 1998 . Struggles: A teenage Fualaau, pictured in 1998, said he struggled while Letourneau was in prison because he desperately wanted to talk to her, but was not allowed . Reunited: Letourneau is pictured with her daughter Audrey during a prison visit in 2003. In the ABC interview, Fualaau said he struggled with not speaking to Letourneau while she was locked up . 'I'm surprised I'm still alive today. I went through a really dark time.' She was released from jail in August 2004 and Fualaau, who was then 21, asked the court to have the no-contact order overturned, which it was. The couple got married just 10 months later at a Washington winery - when she was 43 and he was 22. They have been together ever since. 'If it wasn't strong enough in the beginning, it wouldn't have carried through those years,' Letourneau told Walters in the interview. The couple remained in the same Seattle community where Letourneau had lived with her first husband and their four children. While she was in prison, her husband had moved the children to Alaska, but she remains close to them, she said, and they have good relationships with their two young sisters. Family: She was married and had four children before the affair. She is pictured, right, with one of her sons . Back together: The couple is pictured during a photo shoot at their Normandy Park, Washington home in 2006. She was released from jail in 2004 and they got married a year later . At home: The couple is pictured with their daughters as they drive near their home near Seattle in 2005 . Fualaau, who is just a year older than his wife's oldest son, said it was 'awkward' for him to be so close in age to his stepchildren. But even though they were happy to be reunited, the couple were not without their struggles. In 2006, Fualaau was back in court - this time in the defendant's chair - for drink driving. He was pulled over for speeding and later found to be over the blood-alcohol limit. In trouble: Fualaau is pictured in court in 2006 for a hearing into a drunken driving charge . He was sentenced to a year in jail with all the time but a day suspended and was put on probation for two years. And last year, Letourneau made headlines after she was booked into Washington's King County Jail for failing to go to court following a 2013 third-degree charge of driving on a suspended license. The couple's two daughters, 17-year-old Audrey and 16-year-old Georgia, also joined them for the interview with Walters. Both girls attend school and sing in a choir in the same district where their mother once taught. Audrey graduates high school in June and will start college next fall, while Georgia is a sophomore. The Fualaau sisters said their parents have told them how they met, but they were not taken aback by the scandalous circumstances surrounding their mom and dad's relationship. 'There was never a sit-down chat, \"Now is the time we're going to talk to our children about this\",' their mother said. 'They seemed to already know... because they grew up with it.' While some might compare the story to other female teachers in underage sex scandals,  family friend, photographer Mark Greenberg, told the\u00a0Daily News\u00a0it couldn't be more different. 'I know there are people out there who find it to be nothing other than this woman broke the law and she's a rapist, and yet there are others who see it as 'love is something that's pure' and here's two people who are enjoying the fruits of that,' he said.

{"question_id": 755, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Robert Downey Jr. is making headlines for walking out of an interview with a British journalist who dared to veer away from the superhero movie Downey was there to promote. The journalist instead started asking personal questions about the actor's political beliefs and \"dark periods\" of addiction and jail time. Twitter, of course, is abuzz: Did journalist Krishnan Guru-Murthy go too far? Must every interview be a license for a journalist to ask anything he'd like? From the start of the 7-minute television interview, it seems evident that Downey is not particularly interested in being there, even if being there was, ultimately, a benefit to him -- after all, he's promoting his latest film, \"Avengers: Age of Ultron.\" He grows increasingly agitated, even as the line of questioning remains on-topic; his attitude, meanwhile, grew increasingly smug. His eyes glaze over as the reporter talks, he makes condescending comments and gestures that seem intended to intimidate and imply he's much smarter than Guru-Murthy, and he repeatedly looks toward his handler as if to say, \"Do I really have to sit here with this guy?\" At one point, he makes fun of Guru-Murthy for seeming nervous, saying, \"Your foot is starting to jump a little bit. You better get to your next question.\" But it's after Guru-Murthy asks Downey whether he thinks he is \"free from all of that,\" referring to Downey's history of \"taking drugs, drinking\" that the building tension comes to a head. \"I'm sorry,\" says Downey, \"What are we doing?\" To which Guru-Murthy replies, \"I'm just asking questions,\" which indeed was so. Downey has the right to refuse to answer the question, of course, but that's not what he does next. Instead, he throws the celebrity interview equivalent of a tantrum: He smiles arrogantly, says \"bye!\" and stands up to leave. He sure showed him! It's true that we live in a culture where we feel we have the right to know everything about celebrities -- who they're dating, what they're eating, where they vacation, what they meant when they made that comment 10 years ago. Journalists often go too far, even if it's their job. And certainly not every journalist is good at his job. But while Downey may be understandably tired of answering questions about his past, questions that have been asked before, his business is our business. The entertainment industry is about entertaining people. As such, we tend to like to watch actors who seem like they want to be watched. This is why most celebrities, especially those with a big budget movie to promote, agree to interviews and seek out recognition in general. But when the recognition no longer serves them? Then they want to bemoan it? What Downey seemed to misunderstand is that the interview format gives journalists the right to ask questions. That's what an interview is. He certainly can decline to answer questions he does not feel are appropriate, or even ones he simply doesn't feel like answering. But he does not have the right to be absolved for behavior that is rude, demeaning, and disrespectful -- even if he's a celebrity, and even if he felt uncomfortable or put-off. What the video shows is a movie star with a bullying streak. After he removes his microphone and his handlers begin hustling him out with kid gloves, the actor cannot resist a parting shot. He turns to the reporter, being sure to look directly at the camera on the way, and says, \"You seem okay. It's just getting a little Diane Sawyer in here,\" followed by what sounds like, \"and you're kind of a schmuck.\" Downey might not have been \"in the mood\" to be questioned... and those days, those moods, are understandable. We all have them. And yet in this case, that's, well, too bad. The actor has agreed to an interview as part of his job. He has agreed to engage in a conversation with another professional human being. Given the terms, he is not entitled to call all the shots. That he thinks he can is perhaps our own, celebrity-obsessed doing -- we revere the famous; is it any surprise when they reveal that they, too, regard themselves as better than everyone else? But it's still on him.\n"]}

Mr Johnson poses for yet another selfie with a young fan, before he took to the streets of Ramsgate, Kent . Boris Johnson yesterday fronted a major Tory push into Nigel Farage's backyard as he was mobbed \u2013 and kissed \u2013 by fans in the seat where the Ukip leader hopes to become an MP. The London Mayor took to the streets of Ramsgate, boasting that the polls were turning in the Tories' favour. After touring shops and eating icecreams, Mr Johnson said he 'profoundly and passionately' hopes to stop Mr Farage from winning the target seat of South Thanet. Mr Farage has vowed to quit as Ukip leader if he fails to win the seat, where the Tories are defending a majority of 7,600. After some polls suggested that he could struggle, Ukip has stepped up its resources in the Kent seat. But the Tories hope to appeal to people supporting other parties who want to stop Ukip that they 'can vote for us and cut the head off the snake'. On his walkabout yesterday, Mr Johnson insisted voters knew that only the Tories can secure the recovery: 'There is a real risk other parties could mistakenly persuade people there was any other option.' With Tory Craig Mackinlay at his side, Mr Johnson ate icecream in Tory party blue, chatted to locals sitting outside pubs and handed out leaflets. As he was driven away from the seat, he was pictured with a lipstick mark on his cheek. Mr Mackinlay, a former Ukip deputy leader, is locked in a tight fight with Mr Farage, with Labour's Will Scobie close behind. Mr Johnson yesterday joined\u00a0Tory Craig Mackinlay, who is defending a Conservative majority of around 7,600 in the South Thanet seat . The pair ate Tory blue icecreams at at Sorbetta as they toured shops and businesses in Ramsgate, with Mr Johnson boasting that the polls are turning in the Conservatives' favour . Mr Johnson was met by the usual mob of journalists and turned heads as he walked down the main street toward's the Kent town's harbour. But the mayor - who is running his own campaign to enter Parliament as MP for Uxbridge - also drew placard-waving Ukip supporters. The high profile Conservative was not universally welcomed and was questioned by one person on why the Tories only started paying attention to the seat once Mr Farage announced he was running. Another asked Mr Johnson if he himself would vote Ukip, while the eurosceptic party ensured two of its ad vans followed the group around the town. During his visit, Mr Johnson chatted to people enjoying a drink outside in the bright sunshine at The Royal pub, visited the Rokka cafe and sampled bright blue bubblegum flavour ice cream at Sorbetta. On his walkabout yesterday, Mr Johnson insisted voters knew that only the Tories can secure the recovery . Mr Johnson denied his rare campaign stop outside the capital was an attempt to revitalise a Tory campaign criticised by some for being too negative . Mr Johnson repeatedly told passersby he and Mr Mackinlay were campaigning for 'regeneration for Ramsgate' Speaking to journalists, Mr Johnson denied his rare campaign stop outside the capital was an attempt to revitalise a Tory campaign criticised by some for being too negative. He said: 'I think that on the contrary if you look at the polls at the minute it's very, very interesting. 'You are starting to see some Tory leads but also the poll of polls is starting to put us ahead on average. 'Last week I think we were a point or so behind on average and this week we're ahead. 'I think people are slowly starting to focus on this election, on the choice that is before them and on the record of Conservative government in pulling the economy out of the mire, getting it back on the road. 'There is a real risk other parties could mistakenly persuade people there was any other option.' There was a lot of love for the Mayor when he later visited Finchley in north London . Mr Johnson, who repeatedly told passersby he and Mr Mackinlay were campaigning for 'regeneration for Ramsgate', said he was eager to see the former Ukip leader join the Tory ranks in Parliament. Constituency polling has suggested Mr Mackinlay, who was a founding member of Ukip and contested seats for the party at past general elections, is narrowly ahead of Mr Farage. The Ukip leader has waged his own high profile campaign in the constituency, which was won by the Conservatives on a narrow majority in 2010. Mr Johnson said his campaign would continue to be focused on London, suggesting he would not hit the national campaign trail. He said: 'Unless I specifically tell you otherwise, I am pounding the streets of London every day.' Mr Johnson attracted a lot of admirers as he met supporters in the Kent sunshine yesterday .\n"]}

Megan Huntsman, 40, is facing life in prison after pleading guilty to killing the six newborns, then stashing their bodies in the garage of her home in Pleasant Grove, Utah. A judge today handed Huntsman six sentences of five years to life - but family members rallied round her even as her 'cold and calculated' crimes were recounted to the court. Scroll down for video . Prison: Megan Huntsman, 40, was today given six terms of five years to life in prison after admitting the murders. Three will run consecutively, which means she will spend at least 15 years in prison - and likely much longer. She is pictured today in court . Grisly: Investigators are shown above searching Huntsman's garage, where a total of seven baby corpses were found in cardboard boxes. One of the children was stillborn - Huntsman strangled the rest . Huntsman, a meth addict, told police that she started killing off her children when she got pregnant because her drug problem meant she couldn't care for them. Local reports from the courtroom told how Hunstman's attorney took to the stand and read out letters from two of her daughters, who were born before her addiction began. The letters drew a stark contrast between the loving mother they say they knew, and the type of woman who would kill her own flesh and blood on six different occasions. Her mother, Joyce Huntsman, was reportedly in court - and took the stand to tearfully defend her daughter despite the heinous crimes. Discovery: Hunstman, left, was arrested after her estranged husband Darren West, right, found the bodies in her garage. West, who previously served time in prison, is not considered a suspect in their deaths . Scene: Her estranged husband found one of the babies' bodies while cleaning out the garage at her Pleasent Grove, Utah home, pictured, in April last year . She told the court that the woman who committed the crimes was 'not my Megan'. According to the KSL local news station, a detective recounted Huntsman's cold and deliberate method of execution. Unwitting: West, pictured after the sentencing, is thought not have known nothing about the murders . The officer said Huntsman told she would take the babies in her hands when they were just minutes old. Then, he said, she would press on their necks with her thumbs until they choked to death. She would then put their tiny bodies in . Ultimately the corpses of seven babies were found - one of which was determined to have been stillborn. The crimes were uncovered by Huntsman's husband Darren West - now estranged - who called police when he found the first body. The births and murders are said to have taken place from 1996 to 2006. According to stunned neighbors when she was arrested, Huntsman was 'perpetually slim' and they would never have suspected she was pregnant. The sentences handed down to Huntsman today were the maximum possible for her crimes. Three of them will be served consecutively - meaning she will spend a minimum of 15 years inside, and likely much longer. The sentence brings closure to a case that sent shockwaves through the quiet, mostly Mormon community where Huntsman stored the tiny bodies for more than a decade. The small city of Pleasant Grove is south of Salt Lake City.\n"]}

Kane has been one of the stars of the Premier League, scoring 29 goals in all competitions for Tottenham, and is just one away from becoming their first player since Gary Lineker in 1992 to hit 30 goals in a season. The England forward has been nominated for both PFA Player of the Year and PFA Young Player of the Year. England call-up hurt the form of Harry Kane, according to his Tottenham boss Mauricio Pochettino . Pochettino believes that midfielder Ryan Mason has also been affected by the call-up . Mason has been one of the best young midfielders in England this season and has burst on to the international scene in his first full season in the top flight. But since being called into Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad for the first time for the games against Lithuania and Italy, the duo have been well below their best as Spurs slumped to a goalless draw against Burnley and a shock 1-0 home defeat against Aston Villa last weekend. Pochettino said: \u2018When players get their first call-up, they try to show they are good enough and try to impress the national manager, and because they are over-motivated they expend a lot of energy. \u2018When you come back to the team, the consequence is that for two or three weeks you are a little bit down. It is normal and this happened at Southampton too. \u2018I remember that we were third in the table and we went to play against Arsenal in November. If we won, with three points we\u2019d have been first in the table. The performance wasn\u2019t good. Why? Because we\u2019d spent a lot of energy and it was difficult to keep our focus on the normal life. Pochettino hopes the pair can improve their standard of recent performances against Newcastle . Kane scored on his England debut after coming on as a substitute against Lithuania at Wembley last month . \u2018I remember my first call-up for Argentina against Holland. I was up on a cloud for a month after it because it was unbelievable to play for the national team. When I got back to Espanyol it was difficult. I\u2019d been away for 15 days with my national team and I came back and I said, \u201cOh, but now I play with Redondo, Batistuta...\u201d You feel like a superstar and then you have to go back to Espanyol.\u2019 Meanwhile, Pochettino has told supporters to judge him on where Tottenham finish next season.

He is like Ian Wright, an exploding champagne bottle of a player; shake him up and watch him fizz. Howe is the man who has got them buzzing. Gary Lineker asked if we have found \u2018the English Special One\u2019, but Eddie is not the Special One. He is the Different One. Watch Eddie on the touchline and you will see he is the opposite to Mourinho. Eddie is peaceful during a game, relaxed, quiet and controlled. His extrovert assistant, Jason Tindall, provides the instructions and the demands, with Eddie making his feelings known in a calm and gentle fashion. Obviously the Barclays Premier League will bring different demands for this young man, who is still only 37. Bournemouth's players slide along the turf in delight after their dream came true on Monday night . We got to know each other after my dad signed him for Portsmouth in 2002. He played only twice because of a knee injury that was similar to one that cost me my career. It eventually finished him, too, and while you don\u2019t want to make friends through the same devastating injury, I am glad I got to know him. Some people you meet you can see are destined to be successful. He was always one of them. My dad liked him instantly and had a soft spot for him. I always thought my dad would be the king of Bournemouth, for their FA Cup giantkilling of holders Manchester United in 1984 and their promotion success when he took them into what is now the Championship. But Eddie has blown away those achievements. Lots of clubs will be admiring his progress and while he didn\u2019t enjoy his experience at Burnley when he left Bournemouth in 2011, that won\u2019t stop others casting an eye in his direction. Marc Pugh (left), Ryan Fraser and Harry Arter (right) toast the 3-0 win over Bolton that secured promotion . And why not? He is impressive. He has a good eye for talent, makes big calls, plays young players, is forward-thinking, ambitious and looks the part \u2014 he is a chairman\u2019s dream. He will crave the opportunity to manage in the Premier League and will enjoy recruiting new talent. Bournemouth is a good place to bring up a family and he has also made it a good place to play. It is very different from the leaking stands and muddy pitch at Dean Court that I left behind. My childhood there was a big part of my life, cleaning Luther Blissett\u2019s boots, training with Tony Pulis, Ian Bishop and Gerry Peyton and receiving my schooling in a football environment. But the away end had no roof and the old boys used to sit on wooden benches with cushions that they would throw at you when you were having a poor game. Jamie Redknapp believes Howe was destined for success as soon as got to know him in 2002 . Leaving for Liverpool at 17, I couldn\u2019t get away fast enough. But now I can\u2019t wait to get back there next season. I would never have thought all four of my clubs \u2014 Bournemouth, Liverpool, Spurs and Southampton \u2014 would be in the same league.

Ahead of this weekend's grand prix in China, Ricciardo concedes Red Bull are exploring numerous avenues to correct the problems.

The team has done quite a lot to rectify some issues and get us further up the grid.' Ricciardo has no doubt Renault are also pulling their weight, adding: 'From Melbourne to Malaysia they made a pretty massive step with driveability. 'We also have a few more software things this weekend, which should give things another pretty significant step on that side.

In the bowels of Teotihuacan, a mysterious ancient city that . was once the largest in the Americas, earlier this month Sergio Gomez found 'large quantities' of the silvery metal in a chamber at . the end of a sacred tunnel sealed for nearly 1,800 years. And because of the potential supernatural significance of liquid mercury in ritual ends, deeper into the complex Gomez hopes to find the elusive last resting place of a king. Scroll down for video . Hope: Mexican archaeologist Sergio Gomez has been excavating a pre-Aztec pyramid in Teotihuacan, Mexico, for six years and came across 'large quantities' of liquid mercury earlier this month . Underground: Gomez announced on Friday that he found the liquid mercury in a chamber at the end of a tunnel (pictured) that had been sealed off for more than 1,800 years . 'It's something that completely surprised us,' Gomez said at . the entrance to the tunnel below Teotihuacan's Pyramid of the . Plumed Serpent, about 30 miles  northeast of Mexico City. If Gomez is right, it could help settle a debate over how power was wielded in Teotihuacan, a city boasting massive stone pyramids that was home to as many as 200,000 people and the heart of ancient empire that flourished between 100 and 700 A.D. Some archaeologists believe the toxic element could herald . what would be the first ruler's tomb ever found in Teotihuacan, . a contemporary of several ancient Maya cities, but so shrouded . in mystery that its inhabitants still have no name. Unsure why the mercury was put there, Gomez says the metal . may have been used to symbolize an underworld river or lake. Though mercury has previously been uncovered in small amounts at a few Maya sites much . further south, it had never been found in Teotihuacan. Mercury was rare in ancient Mexico, as it was difficult to mine and prized for its reflective properties. Archaeologists believe it may . have had a supernatural significance for ritual ends. Teotihuacan, or 'abode of the gods' in the Aztec language of . Nahuatl, was distinct from the Mayan civilization. Royalty: Gomez said that he is unsure as to why the mercury was in the tunnel (pictured), but he hopes that it will lead him to the tomb of the city's king . Digging: National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) archaeologists work at a tunnel that may lead to a royal tombs discovered at the ancient city of Teotihuacan in 2011. Gomez said their findings could lead to settling the debate as to how power was distributed in the city . Its . inhabitants left behind no written record, abandoning the city . long before the Aztecs came to power in the 14th Century.

The PDSA has said that obesity levels in pets is at an all-time high, with experts predicting that more than half will be classed as overweight within five years.\u00a0Around one in three dogs and one in four cats are already said to be overweight. Too many treats, the wrong type of food and lack of exercise were to blame for turning some of the nation's bunnies into giants,  the charity added. Scroll down for video . Grace the giant overweight rabbit has joined the PDSA's\u00a0annual Pet Fit Club competition for overweight animals . Carrots were named as the worst culprit as the vegetables are very high in sugar and so should only ever be given as the occasional treat, not as regular feed. Nicola Martin, PDSA Head of Pet Health and Welfare, said: 'Sadly, many of\u00a0our 1.3 million pet rabbit population in the UK are 'unhappy bunnies', as\u00a0many of their welfare needs are being neglected. 'The good news however is that pet obesity is entirely preventable. Experts have warned that more than half of pets will be overweight in five years with carots named as the worst culprits for bunny obesity . Now in its tenth year, the Pet Fit Club puts pets on a six-month diet and exercise programme overseen by vets, leading to one being crowned a super slimmer . 'So\u00a0we're advising owners that, while feeding their pet a treat may be\u00a0rewarding in the short term, as a way of showing affection, the long term\u00a0impact is serious. They could be killing them with kindness.' PDSA research revealed that four-out-of-five veterinary professionals had seen an increase in pet obesity cases in the last two years. The\u00a0problem\u00a0of fat pets has become some widespread that the runs an annual Pet Fit Club competition to put them through their paces. Porky pets are placed on a six-month diet and exercise programme overseen by vets, leading to one being crowned a super slimmer. A veterinary nurse holds bulldog Daisy from Middlesbrough, who weighs 28kg - she is one of 17 of the UK's podgiest pets, who are competing in an annual competition known as Pet Fit Club . Andy Cage from PetAID hospital says that obesity is one of the biggest animal welfare problems . Last year's candidates included Daisy the obese bulldog\u00a0from Middlesbrough, who at 4st 6lb, was double the weight she should have been. Fellow rabbit Poppy was a third heavier than she should be at more than 7lb \u2013 mainly due to a taste for popcorn. Owner Donna Manson said that her rabbits are not dissimilar to us, piling on the pounds over winter, the peak time for comfort eating. Zorro, a three-year-old ginger Tom from Dundee, became so fat he could no longer groom himself and would often wake owner Linda Petrie in the middle of the night for his favourite snack: cheese and onion crisps. Donna said that she had no idea that some of the treats she was giving to her bunnies were so fattening. A happy bunny: Poppy the rabbit was one of last year's competitors in the PDSA pet fit club who has slimmed down now (right) forweighed 7lbs (left) when she entered . Ginger Tom Zorro has become so overweight he is unable to groom himself . 'I've tried to cut down on the carrots and apples, as I've recently learned that they are both high in sugar and not the healthy snacks I thought they were,' she added. Other candidates included a cat that can open the fridge and a Jack Russell with a taste for doner kebabs. PDSA Pet Fit Club was launched in 2005 and has already helped 57 dogs, 24 cats and 3 rabbits lose a total of 295kg (46 stone 6lb). This weight loss is the equivalent of nearly 300 bags of sugar, more than 4,400 sausages, 740 tins of dog food or over 1,000 blocks of lard. Senior Veterinary Surgeon, Andy Cage, from Dundee PetAid hospital, said that having over weight animals is not just a nuisance, it is also an issue of cruelty. 'Obesity is one of the biggest welfare issues affecting pets in the UK today. Sadly, it also means millions of pets are at risk from potentially life-threatening health problems related to obesity. 'But the good news is that obesity is entirely reversible.'\n"]}

{"question_id": 768, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Arkansas Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Wednesday that he won't sign a religious freedom bill that his state's legislature sent to him on Tuesday, citing influence from his politically liberal son. He is sending it back to lawmakers, he told reporters, for amendments that will bring it more in line with the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act \u2013 which critics say better protected the rights of gays and lesbians. Hutchinson said during his press conference that his son had in part convinced him not to sign the bill into law. 'My son Seth, signed the petition\u00a0asking me, Dad, the governor, to veto this bill,' Hutchinson said. 'And he gave me permission to make that reference, and it shows that ... there's a generational difference of opinion on these issues.' Seth told Daily Mail Online that 'I love and respect my father very much, but sometimes we have political disagreements, just as many families do.' 'I had communicated with him my opposition to the bill, along with thousands of other Arkansans and concerned citizens around the country,' he added. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson is a former member of the US Congress, where he was a reliable conservative vote on social issues \u2013 but he said Wednesday that he won't sign a new religious freedom bill into law . LIKE FATHER, LIKE \u2013 WHOA! The Republican governor's son Seth, pictured in a Barack Obama shirt, signed a petition asking his dad to veto the religious freedom law . About 200 demonstrators flooded the steps of the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock on Tuesday after the  bill was passed by both houses of the state legislature . 'I\u2019m proud to have made a small contribution to the overall effort to stop discrimination against the LGBT community in Arkansas, the state that I love (Go hogs!),' the younger Hutchinson said. Seth works as a labor organizing coordinator for the Austin, Texas flagship office of the Texas State Employees Union. 'Most importantly,' he told Daily Mail Online, 'I hope that the groundswell of grassroots opposition to HB 1228 and other similar discriminatory bills around the country will energize more Americans and help create a long-lasting drive for change in this country, on many issues.' His father told reporters hours earlier that the bill on his desk carved out too much new territory. 'The bill that is on my desk at the present time does not mirror the federal law,' Hutchinson said. 'It doesn't mirror it in a couple of ways, particularly allowing the First Amendment to be asserted in the private litigation between parties or reliance on the state law in those claims.' 'Therefore I asked that changes be made in the legislation and I've asked that the leaders in the General Assembly to recall the bill so that it can be amended.' The White House jumped into the fray on Wednesday, with spokesman Josh Earnest telling reporters that the Arkansas legislation could 'be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love.' 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to,' Earnest said. 'And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry.' Hutchinson didn't cite any pressure other than his son's, however. 'My responsibility is to speak out on my own convictions,' Gov. Hutchinson said at the state Capitol, 'and to do what I can as governor to make sure that this bill reflects the people of Arkansas, protects those of religious conscience \u2013 but also minimizes the chance of discrimination in the workplace and in the public environment.' The unusual move \u2013 sending the legislation back without actually vetoing it \u2013 means Hutchinson doesn't risk a veto-override in the state legislature. Lawmakers could refuse to amend the bill and force his hand, or they could do what he asks. Josh Earnest . White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest reacted during his daily press briefing on Wednesday: . 'The piece of legislation that was passed by the Arkansas legislature tracked closely with the legislation that was passed by the Indiana legislature last week. 'The kind of outcry that we saw in response to the Indiana legislation being signed into law by Governor Pence is similar to the outcry that we saw in Arkansas last night after the legislature passed that legislation. 'We saw, you know, some pretty strong criticism including from some pretty prominent business leaders in the state of Arkansas expressing some concern about the impact of that law, and that that law could justifiably \u2013 or could be used to justify discriminating against individuals because of who they love. 'And that is certainly not consistent with the values that the vast majority of Americans subscribe to. And I think, you know, Governor Hutchinson is obviously responding to that outcry. 'But you know, obviously the next step will be for the leaders in Arkansas to determine. I think we've made pretty clear what our views are on that.' The governor has one other option: He said he's considering issuing an executive order to clarify that 'Arkansas wants to be a place of tolerance.' His concern that the bill went further than the 1993 law signed by then-President Bill Clinton was akin to complaints that critics raised this week in Indiana, where a similar law took effect on Monday. One key detail in Indiana's version \u2013 and Arkansas' \u2013 expands the idea of giving conscientious Christians a way to defend themselves if they're sued when their businesses refuse to provide services for gay weddings. They protect against civil suits filed by private individuals, not just those pursued by the government. But few civil-rights suits are filed and funded by allegedly harmed people. State- and federal-level commissions and law-enforcement agencies typically carry them forward. And Indiana University law professor Deborah Widiss told the Associated Press on Wednesday that Religious Freedom Restoration Act laws have not 'been a sort of blank check to discriminate.' At issue is whether a Christian-owned business could legally deny services to gays if doing so would conflict with their religious values. Typically, the issue is raised when same-sex couples seek vendors for their weddings. 'Let me make it clear,' Hutchinson said Wednesday: 'This law under consideration does not extend discrimination. That's important.' 'What is important from an Arkansas standpoint is one, we get the right balance,' he said. 'And secondly, we make sure that we communicate we're not going to be a state that fails to recognize the diversity of our workplace, our economy and our future.' At the same time he seemed to defend the idea of having a law that protected the religious-express rights of business owners. 'This bill simply defines the standard to determine the right balance' between those rights and those of gay men and women, he said. Hutchinson had initially supported the bill and on Tuesday his office said he planned to sign it. 'This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial, but these are not ordinary times,' he said Wednesday as Americans watched his quick 180-degree turn. Hutchinson spoke to reporters outside his office at the state Capitol in Little Rock on Wednesday, saying that he wants a religious freedom law changed so it better reflects a federal law that took effect in 1993 . DAD-WHISPERER: Seth Hutchinson seems to have had an outsize influence on his famous dad . As Arkansas braced for the possibility that it would become the new religious-freedom ground zero, Wal-Mart, the state's largest for-profit employer, had insisted that the new legislation was a bad idea. Those objections were unexpected in some corners because the massive big-box chain is seen as a rare bastion of Christian values in a crowded secular marketplace. The Walton family, the company founders who still own a large stake, are famous for using leadership models culled from Christian service traditions. Wal-Mart also is known for selling enough Christian-themed books to worry some religious bookstores. Yet\u00a0Doug McMillon, the company's CEO, signed a statement saying that the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act 'threatens to undermine the spirit of inclusion present throughout the state of Arkansas and does not reflect the values we proudly uphold.' 'Every day in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve,' McMillon said. Arkansas legislators defied widespread criticism in passing the bill on Tuesday. A similar measure that Indiana Republican Gov. Mike Pence signed into law a day earlier became an instant national flashpoint in the gay rights debate. It took Pence less than a day to capitulate to protesters, saying in a press conference that he would work with legislators to 'fix' the law's language. FLASHPOINT: Rallies like this one in Arkansas ould spread to the other 19 states where versions of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act are already on the books . Arkansas state Rep. Bob Ballinger (right) sponsored the bill and was all smiles when it passed, but now his brainchild is in limbo . 'WE WILL FIX THIS': Indiana Gov. Mike Pence told reporters on Tuesday that he wants legislation on his desk by the end of the week to clarify that his state's new religious freedom law does not allow discrimination . Wal-Mart isn't the only big player that would have complained if Hutchinson had signed the bill. NASCAR said in a statement Tuesday that it was 'disappointed' by Indiana's legislation, and would likely pile on in the Razorback State. The NCAA, which has had its headquarters in Indianapolis since 1999, says it is concerned about the law's effect on future Indiana events including this week's Final Four men's basketball tournament. The governors of New York, Vermont, Washington and Connecticut have announced bans on certain state-funded travel to Indiana. Mayors of Denver, Seattle and Washington, D.C. have followed suit for city-funded travel. Those restrictions could have quickly doubled in size to include Arkansas. Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said Tuesday that the Indiana law 'flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support.' The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment about whether the Arkansas bill would be equally offensive to the Obama administration.\n"]}

Joyce Cox was just days away from celebrating her fifth birthday when she was strangled to death on her way home from school in Cardiff on September 28, 1939. The schoolgirl had been walking with her older brother Dennis, who was seven at the time, but she disappeared when he lost sight of her. Her body was found dumped by a railway station but police have never caught her killer. Now, Terry Phillips, 71, who is Joyce's cousin, has accused the Metropolitan Police of a 'cover-up' after the force said information could not be released about her murder because it is unfair to the mystery suspect. Joyce Cox was just days away from celebrating her fifth birthday when she was strangled to death on her way home from school in Cardiff on September 28, 1939. Her body was found but her killer has never been caught . The front page of the South Wales Echo shows the newspaper report following Joyce's death in September 1939, and reveals how officers want to track down a 'man with a slouch' in connection with her murder . Mr Phillips, who was not born at the time his relative was abducted and killed, used the Freedom of Information Act to find out more information about the case. He contacted the Met about the killing - the oldest unsolved murder in Wales - since the London-based force was drafted in to help South Wales Police with serious crimes at the time. He said that while he managed to establish that the force holds documents about the case, officers slapped an order on the file demanding it be kept secret for 100 years after the events concerned - until January 2040. A decision letter sent to Mr Phillips said: 'A named subject who was a suspect is described derogatorily and should not be associated with these matters. 'As an unsolved murder, with potential of re-investigation at any indeterminate stage, practice to close for 100 years is invoked. The family of Joyce (pictured) are accusing police of a 'cover-up' for not releasing paperwork on the case . 'However unlikely - indeed remote - it may be that this case is re-opened, we have to afford for that possibility. Putting information into the public domain will include naming specific persons who may yet be identified. 'These persons who may be living may have been witnesses and/or interviewees and who were not prosecuted and who therefore must be regarded as innocent parties. 'Persons will have given witness statements in the expectation that their information would not become public knowledge.' Mr Phillips said he 'does not accept the reason for refusing to release the documents'. He said: 'This smacks of a cover-up to me. As a result of this decision, which I am appealing against, I wouldn't get access to the file until I was 96, even if I lived that long. 'Joyce's murder had a devastating impact on the family. Dennis never forgave himself for letting Joyce out of his sight as they walked home. 'He never came to terms with it and died about eight years ago.' The body of Joyce, who lived in the Whitchurch area of Cardiff, was found on a railway embankment near Coryton station just weeks after Britain declared war on Germany. It was discovered by a dog walker who came across her remains when his spaniel began barking. Dozens of Joyce's schoolfriends turned out for her funeral on October 4, 1939, as documented in the South Wales Echo & Evening Express (above). The funeral procession went through\u00a0Whitchurch in Cardiff . Joyce was buried\u00a0at St Mary's Parish Church in Cardiff and has since been joined by her late mother Irene . Police found a copy of the Western Mail newspaper and a tobacco pouch near her body, and outlined at least two suspects in connection with her murder. Newspaper reports from the South Wales Echo at the time, reveal how police wanted to trace a 'man with a slouch' in connection with the killing. However, despite interviewing more than one thousand people and following numerous leads, Joyce's killer has never been caught. Mr Phillips, who is desperate to learn more information about the case, has since been in touch with a leading forensic scientist who has told him that advances in DNA technology could now make it possible to identify the killer. The family believe that had the murder occurred in modern day then her killer would have been caught. MailOnline has contacted Metropolitan Police and South Wales Police for comment.\n"]}

A Tennessee teenager on trial for murder says he killed his mother with a sledgehammer because she knew he had been raped by his older brother and did nothing about it. Zachary Davis was fifteen when he bludgeoned his mother's skull 12 times as she slept and then set his family home ablaze in an effort to also kill his elder sibling Josh. On Tuesday, a court in Hendersonville heard how Davis, now 17, laughed as he killed his mother Melanie Davis in August 2012, leaving her bloodied and unrecognizable before fleeing. Davis is charged with first-degree murder, attempted first-degree murder and aggravated arson and the court was shown gruesome images of the crime scene as his trial began on Monday. According to prosecutors, Davis, his mother and brother went to see the comedy movie, The Campaign on August 10 and then returned home. Melanie Davis went to sleep at 9pm, 'not knowing that her younger son was planning something sinister, something unspeakable.' In testimony given to the court by Major Don Linzy, Chief of Detectives at the Sumner County Sheriff's Office, Davis confessed after he was apprehended at a convenience store eight miles away, having fled the scene. 'Yes, sir, I killed my mom in her sleep with a sledgehammer,' Linzy told the court on Tuesday according to the Tennessean. Linzy said that during his interview Davis was asked why he killed his mother with a sledgehammer and replied, 'I was worried that I'd miss,' and that using that type of weapon gave him the 'highest chance of killing her.' Battered: The teen's single mother Melanie Davis, 46, was killed with a sledgehammer while she was sleeping in her bed . Shockingly, Davis told Linzy during his confession that he he laughed out loud for no reason he could remember during his frenzied attack. He also said he only had one regret from that night, 'I would probably kill Josh with a sledgehammer too.' However, during his interrogation, Davis did tell police why he brutally killed his mother and tried to kill his brother by burning down the house. Linzy told the court on Tuesday that Davis alleged his brother, Josh raped him and that he told his mom, 'who didn't do anything about it.' Josh Davis vehemently denies ever sexually abusing his family and Linzy told the court law enforcement came to the same conclusion. 'We started a child protective team to see if it happened,' he said according to the Tennessean. 'We did not have anything to corroborate Zach's statement.' Mental illness: Zachary Davis legal team admit that their client burned his own house down and killed his mother but was suffering delusions at the time . Indeed, Josh Davis, 19, spoke in court on Tuesday and saw his brother for the first time in two years. He told the prosecution that he and Zach were close and said that until the shocking murder his entire family were all close. He said that he, Zach and his mother had bonded after the death from their father from ALS in 2007 and the first he knew of his brother's murderous intentions was on the evening of August 10. He told the court he awoke to the sound of the smoke alarm and ran to his mother's room but found it was locked. He said he broke the door down to find her dead and ran to his neighbors' home for safety. Sumner County District Attorney Ray Whitley said that on the night of August 10, Davis packed a backpack with notebooks, a toothbrush, gloves, a ski mask and a clawhammer and readied himself. Horrific:\u00a0On the night of August 10 Davis allegedly attacked his mother before moving upstairs into their home's game room, pictured, where he lit a fire, hoping to kill his sleeping brother as well . Far beyond: Davis is seen here in 2012: It was determined that his charges were so severe that he would not be charged in juvenile court . 'Zach Davis had planned and intended to kill his mother and brother, and tonight was the night,' said Whitley according to the Tennessean. After killing his mother, he set fire to an upstairs room using gasoline and whiskey but closed the door and the fire did not catch as he intended. Defense attorney Randy Lucas has asked jurors to listen to all the evidence before they reached their verdict, despite admiting that his client did kill his mother. Lucas will argue that his client was suffering from mental illness. 'The voice of his father told him to kill his mother,' said Lucas to the court. A volunteer firefighter, Winton Batson, told the court how he rushed into the home to try and rescue anyone inside. He said he found his way to Melanie Davis' bedroom and saw her body. 'I saw immediately that there had been significant trauma to her skull,' he said.\n"]}

And now a photographer has captured the finer details of these iridescent insects in stunning clarity, including the rainbow scales of their delicate wings. Some look like exotic bird feathers and colourful ribbon, while others resemble jagged autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges. Scroll down for video . These stunning pictures show the finer details of a butterfly's wing in stunning clarity, including their rainbow scales. As well as the beautiful colours, they show the layout of individual scales, which give the insect its iridescence. This image shows the wing of a sunset moth . The photos were shot by Linden Gledhill from Staffordshire, who combines his love of photography with a PhD in biochemistry. The 51-year-old uses a modified microscope and a camera to capture the detail of the butterfly's wing pattern. His photographs show the pretty insects\u2019 scale-covered wings. Butterfly wings are covered by thousands of microscopic scales split into two to three layers, which gives them their Greek order name of Lepidoptera - meaning scaled wings. Each scale is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye-catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments themselves. Some of the scales look like exotic bird feathers, while others resemble autumnal leaves that change colour at the outer edges, such as this beautiful image of a detached scale from a tiger swallowtail . The tiny scales combine to give the striking colouration of the Eastern tiger swallowtail (stock image). It is a species of swallowtail butterfly native to eastern North America and is one of the most familiar butterflies in the eastern US, where it is common in many different habitats . Each scale of a butterfly is pigmented with melanins that give butterflies black and brown colouring, but eye-catching blues, greens, reds and iridescence (pictured) are created by the microstructure of the scales, rather than pigments. A\u00a0Papilio blumei fruhstorferi wing is shown . The brighter colours on some butterflies are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales, such as these jagged examples, which are Papilio ulysees butterfly scales.\u00a0In fact, each scale has multiple layers which are separated by air, so when light hits them it's reflected many times and the combination of these reflections causes us to see the intense yellows and blues of many butterfly species . The brighter colours are created thanks to the scattering of light by the scales, which are layered in different patterns on top of each other. In fact, each scale has multiple layers which are separated by air, so when light hits them it's reflected many times and the combination of these reflections causes us to see the intense yellows and blues of many butterfly species. Some butterflies even reflect ultraviolet light, which is unable to be seen by humans. The ability of Monarch butterflies to detect ultraviolet light helps them on their annual migration from North America to Mexico, for example. Mr Gledhill said: 'I've always taken macro photographs of insects, moths and butterflies. I have a lifelong interest in exploring the world beyond what the unaided human eye can see. \u2018This led me to use research quality microscopes and combining the two skills.\u2019 He uses a trinocular-reflecting light microscope fitted with Neo S-plan objectives, or attachments, and takes the photographs using a Canon EOS 5D mark II, which is fitted to the top of the microscope. The microscope has also been modified by adding a StackShot stepping motor and controller to drive the focusing control, meaning very small steps can be made in the focusing stage.

This close-up image shows scales on the wings of the monarch butterfly . Mr Gledhill imaged the Madagascan sunset moth's wings in minute detail. The moth (pictured left) flies during the day and is considered one of the most impressive and appealing-looking lepidopterans. He also captured the wings of the monarch butterfly (stock image shown right), which is the most familiar North American butterfly species .

This camera is fitted to the top of the microscope. Overlapping pale blue scales are pictured . The depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image, so Mr Gledhill takes up to 200 separate images spaced by one micron intervals to capture the creatures. These images are then combined into a single imaging using focus stacking software, resulting in pictures that are sharp and in full focus. 'The pictures are stunningly beautiful and they make me realise how lucky I am to be able to capture the intricate structure of butterflies,\u2019 Mr Gledhill continued. 'Often people think they are fabric and appear very surprised when they find out they are the scales which look like dust which they remember experiencing when they touched a butterfly as a child.' The depth of field in a single microscope image is too small to see the whole of the butterfly in one image, so Mr Gledhill takes up to 200 separate images spaced by one micron intervals to capture the creatures, before carefully combining the shots.

According to Paris prosecutor's spokeswoman Agnes Thibault-Lecuivre, the lawsuit was filed March 27 and a preliminary investigation was opened by the prosecutor's office Wednesday. The media outlet, CNN affiliate BFMTV, is accused of endangering the lives of the hostages, who were hiding in a cold room during the attack, by broadcasting their location live during the siege. BFM in a statement Friday said one of its journalists \"mentioned only once the presence of a woman hidden inside the Hyper Cacher, on the basis of police sources on the ground.\" \"Immediately, the chief editor felt that this information should not be released. It therefore has subsequently never been repeated on air or posted on-screen. BFMTV regrets that the mention of this information could cause concern to the hostages, as well as their relatives, that their lives were in danger,\" the statement said. Gunman Amedy Coulibaly, also suspected in the slaying of a police officer, stormed the Hyper Cacher Jewish supermarket on January 9, killing four people and taking others hostage. He was killed in the police operation to end the siege.

{"question_id": 777, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)On Thursday, NPR -- headquartered in Washington, just 40 miles away from Baltimore -- ran its latest update on the urban turmoil that has erupted in the wake of the death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray because of still-unexplained spinal injuries that occurred while he was under police custody. Unfortunately, while it was a freshly produced segment, it was hardly a new story. Titled \"Baltimore Unrest Reveals Tensions Between African-Americans And Asians,\" the five-minute piece is urgently introduced with the promise that it will reveal \"what's really happening in the more troubled neighborhoods of this majority black city,\" going on state that a key ingredient of the unrest was African-Americans \"targeting Asian-owned businesses for destruction.\" A similar claim was made after Ferguson's uprising in August of last year. Indeed, it has been a toxic feature of the coverage of many episodes of mass metropolitan violence since the late 1980s, the era during which the trope of widespread hostility between Asian and black communities first took root in the media consciousness. Yes, interethnic tensions continue to exist, though they are hardly limited to Asians and blacks. And yes, this has resulted in troubling incidents and tragedies on both sides. But while reports say that during the chaotic social breakdowns of the past year, black-owned businesses were mostly protected during bouts of violence, there's little evidence to suggest a pattern in which Asian businesses have been actively targeted out of racial animus. Instead, it seems as if Asian-owned stores have experienced damage partly because they make up a portion of establishments operating in the most economically vulnerable and socially volatile of neighborhoods. In other words, they were collateral damage, along with other stores in the vicinity of riots. So it's time to call this persistent meme what it is: A misleading, hyperbolic and dangerous distraction, one that shifts blame away from the real issues. As Jennifer Lee, sociology professor at University of California, Irvine, and author of the 2002 book \"Civility in the City: Blacks, Jews and Koreans in Urban America,\" notes, \"the mainstream media continues to pit minority groups against one another to draw attention from larger structural problems that plague poor, disadvantaged communities. By directing our attention to interminority conflict, it directs blame away from the structures that perpetuate gross inequality and toward individual problems.\" Let's be honest. There were then -- and still are -- legitimate issues that exist between immigrant storeowners and the largely African American customers they serve that are rooted in extensive cultural differences. There's no denying that friction exists in the daily transaction between embattled communities trying hard to coexist under economic and social pressures. For example, in 1993, the robbery and shooting of Joel Lee, a 21-year-old Korean American at Towson State University, and the subsequent acquittal of his killer, was a point of contention between the Korean and African American communities. But things are different now. Decades after the height of media-inflamed tension between Asian and African Americans, patterns of immigration have shifted. Stores once operated by recent Korean immigrants are now owned by strivers from South Asia, the Middle East and Africa. The population of Baltimore has shrunk and its economy has contracted. Among merchants, there's ever-greater recognition that they and their customers are tied by a red thread, surviving or failing together. For decades, black and Asian advocacy groups have been trying to bridge differences between the communities. For example, the Baltimore-based Korean-American Grocers & Licensed Beverage Association of Maryland, founded in 1995, has worked to support its entrepreneurial members in their own attempts to address longstanding issues of neglect and abuse by Baltimore's police, while also encouraging them to build deeper ties with their constituents. A KAGRO-sponsored annual scholarship program has given hundreds of thousands of dollars in college grants to children growing up in the Baltimore neighborhoods their member retailers serve. These aren't the kind of stories you'll hear in the media. It's easier to focus on attention-grabbing anecdotes rather than the long, hard work of adjustment and accommodation going on within and around communities. Back in 1995, the Baltimore Sun profiled Soon Jae and Eun Ja Lee, owners of Lee's Food Market in the West Baltimore's Sandtown neighborhood -- the same part of the city that NPR called out as a locus of Asian-black tension. The story highlighted the Lees' openness to the community, their politeness and care for their customers and their outstanding generosity, which includes both free snacks to schoolchildren and the distribution of tens of thousands of free food baskets to needy local families each year. I spoke with Eun Ja Lee, calling her without warning to check on the status of the Lees' four-decade-old business after the violence of Monday and Tuesday. Were they open? Were they safe? \"Oh, of course we're open, we're always open!\" said Mrs. Lee, warmly and brightly. \"This week, many customers came in and said to me 'Mrs. Lee, don't worry you are part of our community, you are our family. We will make sure you are OK -- just stay open!' We love it. We love it.\" And yet, no one has come and interviewed her at their untouched and fully operational family market, nor have they talked with her customers, stoutly loyal after 37 years of patronage. Reinforcing the tired narrative of black-Asian interracial tension generates heat, but not light. There's a far more complex and nuanced relationship between these two urban populations, one that is in an ongoing state of evolution -- and it deserves to be told, not buried under cliches and clickbait.\n"]}

Speaking of the Nepalese capital where the scientific meeting was held, one expert said it the devastation was 'an accident waiting to happen'. 'Physically and geologically what happened is exactly what we thought would happen,' said\u00a0seismologist James Jackson, head of the earth sciences department at the Cambridge University. 'I was walking through that very area where that earthquake was and I thought at the very time that the area was heading for trouble,' said Mr Jackson, lead scientist for Earthquakes Without Frontiers, a group that tries to help Asian cities prepare for disasters. Locals rescued two more dust-covered men, pulling them up on the the street as they work to find and rescue any survivors of the disaster . Earthquakes of similar magnitude can have bigger effects on different parts of the globe because of the manner of building construction and population density. A 7.8 magnitude earthquake could kill 10 to 30 per one million residents in California, but has killed at least 1,900 in Nepal, and could kill up to 10,000 in parts of Pakistan, India, Iran and China, said U.S. Geological Survey seismologist David Wald. With the death toll steadily creeping up (to 2,500 on Sunday evening), the full extent of the horror brought by the earthquake is slowly unfolding. As rescuers scramble to save stranded climbers on Mount Everest where 18 died under avalanches yesterday, experts are warning the worst of the disaster is to come. Aftershocks rocked the Himalayan country this morning with residents describing the tremors in terrifying detail. One registered 6.9 on the Richter Scale and is feared to have triggered yet more avalanches on Everest. While the original earthquake's magnitude - 7.9 - labelled it a 'major' incident, it struck just 11km underground, making its effects all the more\u00a0devastating. Coupled with that is its lack of preparation for such destructive tremors. A relatively poor country, its buildings are shoddily constructed and easily torn down. Experts also fear the earthquake's shallowness could have sparked landslides across the mountainous region. This is the fifth significant earthquake in Nepal in the last 205 years, including a massive one in 1934 that levelled the city. 'They knew they had a problem but it was so large they didn't where to start, how to start,' said Hari Ghi, south east Asia regional coordinator for Geohazards International, a group that calculates worldwide quake risks. Nepal was making progress on reducing its vulnerability to earthquakes, but not quickly or big enough. Mr Ghi's group, on April 12, updated a late 1990s report summarising the Kathmandu Valley risks. 'With an annual population growth rate of 6.5 per cent and one of the highest urban densities in the world, the 1.5 million people living in the Kathmandu Valley were clearly facing a serious and growing earthquake risk,' the report said, laying out 'the problem' the valley faces. 'It was also clear that the next large earthquake to strike near the Valley would cause significantly greater loss of life, structural damage, and economic hardship than past earthquakes had inflicted.' And for years there were no building codes and rampant development so homes and other structures could be built without any regards to earthquakes, the report said. There are now building codes, but that doesn't help the older structures, and the codes aren't overly strong, Mr Ghi said. It's actually even made worse because of local inheritance laws that require property be split equally among all sons, Mr Jackson said. 'So that means buildings are split vertically among brothers making very thin rickety homes that need more space so people add insecure living space on additional floors, he said. 'The construction is appalling in Kathmandu,' he said. Poverty and pollution make the problem worse. That's because people don't spend time worrying about some future earthquake because they have more pressing problems. 'If you live in the Kathmandu Valley you have other priorities, daily threats and daily nasty things happen to you in terms of air quality, water quality, pollution, traffic and just poverty,' Mr Jackson said. 'But it doesn't mean that the earthquakes go away.' Nepalese rescue teams remove a body from the rubble of the historic 19th century Darahara Tower in Kathmandu which collapsed in the quake .

Dozens of people were gathered in the car park of Kathmandu's Norvic International Hospital, where thin mattresses had been spread on the ground for patients rushed outside, some patients wearing hospital pyjamas, while doctors and nurses were treating people. The United States Geological Survey said the quake struck 81 kilometres (50 miles) northwest of Kathmandu at 06.11 GMT, with walls crumbling and families racing outside of their homes. The 7.8 magnitude tremor was the worst to hit the poor South Asian nation in over 80 years. Television footage showed a huge swathe of houses had collapsed in while roads had been split in two by the force of the impact. India was first to respond to Nepal's appeal for help by sending in military aircraft with medical equipment and relief teams. Britain has deployed a team of humanitarian experts to Nepal to provide urgent support for people affected by the quake, International Development Secretary Justine Greening announced tonight. Ms Greening said: 'My thoughts are with the people of Nepal, in particular all those who have lost loved ones. 'The absolute priority must be to reach people who are trapped and injured, and provide shelter and protection to those who have lost their homes. 'Nepal needs our urgent humanitarian assistance. That is why we have rapidly deployed a team of humanitarian experts who will immediately begin work assessing the damage and helping the Nepalese authorities respond to this devastating earthquake.' It came after Prime Minister David Cameron pledged that the UK would do all it can to help in the aftermath on the Nepal earthquake. On Twitter he said: 'Shocking news about the earthquake in Nepal - the UK will do all we can to help those caught up in it.' Foreign Secretary, Philip Hammond, added his condolences and said the British Embassy was providing help to any UK nationals caught up in the disaster. 'My thoughts are with the people of Nepal and everyone affected by the terrible loss of life and widespread damage caused by the earthquake,' he said. 'We are in close contact with the Nepalese government. The British Embassy in Nepal is offering our assistance to the authorities and is providing consular assistance to British Nationals.'\n"]}

Jon Huxley, 46, hopes to cash in on the Fifty Shades of Grey effect and attract guests from the gay and swinging communities at his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent. He plans to install sex swings, bondage rooms and dungeons and have rooms of differing sizes to cater for couples and multiple groups. Jon Huxley, standing outside his hotel Westward Ho! in Folkestone, Kent, is looking at 'developing' his premises to cater for swingers . He hopes the craze in Fifty Shades of Grey, starring Jamie Dornan as Christian Grey and Dakota Johnson as his object of affection Anastasia Steele, can help transform his business. He said: 'We have plans to attract tourists from the gay and swinging community for short breaks and weekends of adult fun. 'Obviously a lot of equipment will need to be installed like swings, bondage rooms, red room of pain and dungeons of delight. 'We would be having these events each weekend and accepting tourist guests during the week. 'Food and drink will be provided as part of an all-inclusive hotel package and it would be a civilised and friendly environment.' Mr Huxley will be hoping to recreate scenes like this from the hit film Fifty Shades of Grey . Clothing will be optional and privacy for our guests will therefore need to be ensured. 'It is not intended to be a seedy or dirty business. It is a respected clientele who enjoy taking their clothes off.' Mr Huxley said he has decided to appeal to the swinging community after rowing with the council over the use of Grade-II listed building. Jon Huxley hopes the change in hotel ethos can see his business grow . For months he had been in a dispute with Shepway District Council over complaints about its use as a house of multiple occupation for homeless people. Councillors voted for an enforcement notice after neighbours complained of anti-social behaviour. Mr Huxley said the complaints had been about anti-social behaviour and noise from the street rather than from inside the property. He said he would not need a council entertainments licence because there would be no live entertainment, loud music or dancing. Asked what locals might think of his plans he said: 'I do not involve myself in what happens behind their closed doors and they should not involve themselves in what happens behind mine. 'I have bills to pay and the income has to come from somewhere. They have seen fit to take away my current source of guests so I have to look for other sources. 'I can't attract tourists because there isn't a market for it anymore and that is a fact I have to deal with. 'This is a growing market and I can't think of any other market that is growing at the rate of this one. 'Fifty Shades of Grey has been a phenomenal success and this is a sleeping giant in terms of the opportunities that are there.' Mr Huxley, who has owned the hotel for 13 years, said the special weekends would be controlled through advance bookings rather than being open to casual callers. They would be advertised predominantly through the internet or word of mouth with some advertising in 'appropriate places'. A spokesperson for Shepway District Council told MailOnline Travel: 'We would expect the owner to contact the council to discuss any licensing requirements, and to obtain listed building consent for internal works. 'The premises has currently got planning permission to be used as a hotel but does not hold a premises licence to sell alcohol. 'Anything the owner wishes to use it for outside permitted use may well require planning permission or new licences.'

But, lucky for George, a family was willing to stay with Shelby - and only more and more strangers followed as they heard his story. Scroll down for video . Twenty strangers joined forces to help rescue a dog named Shelby out of a tar pit he had gotten stuck in near the shoreline of the Great Salt Lake . As more people came, they began bringing  items to try and help get Shelby out, using grocery bags, car floor mats, tarp, garbage bags, a straw hat and even bare hands . 'The whole time I was driving I kind of figured there was already a really good chance he was already gone,' George told Fox 13 Salt Lake City. And at first the situation looked 'pretty hopeless', according to Max McGregor, whose family stayed with the dog. 'I was pretty sure that the back legs, the way they were positioned, they were going to snap right where the knee was,' said McGregor's daughter Chloe. Todd Tanner, a Fox 13 reporter who was supposed to shoot video of the Spiral Jetty that day, said only Shelby's head was visible from the pit. He thought the dog was dying.

The letter has since been retweeted tens of thousands of times . Instead, the Indiana native played four games with her team at Mount St. Joseph University in Cincinnati, and raised more than $1.5 million for research into the cancer she suffered from. But as her condition worsened, the teenager became an honorary coach and earlier this year, she moved to Cincinnati Children's Hospital. She passed away at the hospital on Friday morning. As news of her death became public, thousands of people across the country - both basketball fans and not - took to social media to express their sorrow at her death, and show support for her family. Only a year and a half ago, Lauren, whose cancer saw her rapidly gain weight, had been just another teenager preparing for college after deciding to play basketball for Mount St. Joseph. But a few weeks later, she started feeling dizzy while playing for her high school team in nearby Lawrenceburg, Indiana. Tests found her tumor and she was told she had less than two years left. Diagnosis: Lauren is pictured left in December 2013, and right, in December 2014, after her treatment for\u00a0Diffuse Intrinsic Pontine Glioma (DIPG), a rare childhood brain cancer which changed her appearance . Brave: Lauren, who used her limited energy to inspire people and raise money for research into the cancer that ultimately took her life, is pictured in her room in Cincinnati last December - months before she passed away . In September, doctors gave her the devastating news she wouldn't make it past December - and after years as a standout player, Lauren's hopes of playing college basketball were put in jeopardy. However, the NCAA granted permission to move the school's opening game forward because of her worsening condition. On November 2, Lauren realized her dream of playing for the school. Incredibly, she scored the first and last baskets of the team's 66-55 victory over Hiram College. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is a type of brain tumor found in the part of the brainstem at the lower back of the brain. Due to the tumor's location, it can cause double vision, difficulty controlling eye movement and facial expressions, and difficulty swallowing and chewing. It may also cause weakness in the limbs. The condition primarily affects children most often between the ages of four and nine. Between 100 and 150 new diagnoses are made a year in the U.S. Only 300 are made across North America and Europe a year. It can be treated with radiation, but chemotherapy is generally not effective and surgery is impossible due to the spread of the cancer into healthy tissue. Unlike with other childhood cancers, there has been little progress in improving treatments and cure rates for the condition over the last few decades. Fewer than 10 per cent of children with DIPG survive two years after their diagnosis. Source: DIPG Registry . 'It's a dream come true,' Lauren told reporters at the time. 'To play on a college court, to put my foot down on the floor and hear the roar of the crowd - I just love it so much. I love basketball. 'Everything that happened today was amazing. I'm truly happy, it's a really good day.' At the game, Lauren said she wanted to find a cure for the rare cancer, which has a less than 10 per cent survival rate and most often affects children aged four to nine. 'When I was diagnosed I remember kind of feeling lonely because nobody understood,' she said following the game,\u00a0USA Today\u00a0reported. 'And now that more people know about this story and the awareness of DIPG. 'I'm so happy that people know about it now and that we can get some research going and hopefully find that home run cure for cancer. And even though I'm probably not going to be around to see it, it's going to help a lot of people.' Lauren played in four games and made five layups before the spreading tumor made her stop. When the season ended, her team held its annual dinner in the hospital where Hill was being treated. She was also honored at local sporting events and was featured on a box of Wheaties - known as the Breakfast of Champions. The U.S. Basketball Writers Association voted her the Pat Summitt Most Courageous Award, which is normally awarded at the Final Four.\u00a0Athletes from other colleges autographed No. 22 jerseys - her number - and sent them in support. As the cancer slowed her down, Lauren's family, friends and teammates took a bigger role in promoting her fundraising campaign - and she kept reminding everyone to appreciate life. 'Life is precious,' she told WKRC-TV before her death. 'Every moment you get with someone is a moment that's blessed, really blessed.'

The co-founder of her nonprofit foundation confirmed Lauren's death in hospital on Friday. 'Through Lauren's fundraising and advocacy efforts, she not only became a spotlight on the lack of funding for cancer research, but she most certainly has become a beacon guiding researchers for years to come,' The Cure Starts Now co-founder Brooke Desserich said. Her nonprofit foundation helped to raise more than $1.5 million for cancer research. 'She's made an impact on the world, more so than me - more than I ever will do,' Lauren's coach Dan Benjamin said. 'I've gotten so many emails and phone calls from all over the world. People are contacting me because they want to share her story.'

Spears' bosses at DPS saw the posting and then cited him, according to the Dallas Morning News. The official reprimand\u00a0read: 'While working a secondary employment job, Trooper Spears took a photo with a public figure who has a well-known criminal background including numerous drug charges. 'The public figure posted the photo on social media and it reflects poorly on the Agency.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him. Snoop has convictions for drug possession and stood trial for murder in 1993 before being acquitted. Since Spears was only reprimanded with counseling, DPS does not view the penalty as a formal disciplinary action and the trooper cannot appeal. DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said on Wednesday: 'DPS does not typically discuss or release specifics of personnel issues unless they result in disciplinary action as outlined in Government Code 411.00755 and 411.0072. 'Supervisors counsel and coach employees on a regular basis, and these efforts do not constitute formal discipline by the department.' The counseling advised Spears to say no when people ask for a picture with him but that's about it . Attorney Ty Clevenger is representing Spears and covering the case on his blog. He wrote: 'DPS claims that the counseling forms are not really discipline, therefore the employee has no right to appeal. 'Yet those counseling incidents can block a trooper\u2019s chances for promotion or advancement. 'So it appears that DPS commanders are papering Billy\u2019s file with counseling incidents because they can\u2019t prove that he violated any law, order, or policy, and they know that he will beat them with the law and the facts if he is given an opportunity to appeal.'

Now, at the age of 64, he's facing criminal charges. Japanese police say they arrested the man, Yuhei Takashima, on Wednesday over allegations he photographed an obscene act with a girl of 13 or 14 and produced pornography in a hotel room in Manila, the Philippine capital. Police officers seized 147,600 photos that Takashima took of his activities over the years, said Takeshi Akimoto, the police officer in charge of crime involving minors in Kanagawa, a prefecture south of Tokyo. The pictures were kept in more than 400 photo albums, he said. Takashima, who comes from the city of Yokohama, told police that he began paying for sex with women in 1988 when he went to work at a Japanese school in Manila. He said that stepping outside of moral codes relieved the heavy pressure he felt at work, according to police. Takashima told police that he continued to pay for sex because it was so cheap. After the end of his three-year stint at the school in Manila, he frequently returned to the Philippines on vacations in order to buy sex. He said the ages of the prostitutes he hired ranged from 14 to over 70. The Philippines is a notorious destination for sex tourists, including pedophiles. The country's sex industry is tied to human trafficking and feeds off the high poverty rate. Akimoto, the police officer, said Takashima's case had been under investigation since 2013. The incident for which he was arrested is believed to have taken place in Manila in January 2014.

Experts blame increasingly sedentary lifestyles and an obsession with mobile phones for a sharp rise in the number of young people with back and neck problems. And they warn that children as young as 12 are seeking treatment. As gadgets get smaller, users lean over them more, putting the neck and shock-absorbing discs that cushion the vertebrae under added pressure . Some 45 per cent of the under-30s surveyed for the British Chiropractic Association said they had a painful back or neck \u2013 up from 28 per cent last year. Across all age groups, 86 per cent said it was a problem \u2013 compared with 77 per cent last year. Almost one in four said that they are in pain on a daily basis. Chiropractors blame the increase on days and nights spent sitting hunched over mobile phones and tablet computers. Rishi Loatey, a chiropractor in North-West London, sees patients who are still at school, including some as young as 12. He said working on laptops and tablets rather than desktop computers, as well as using mobile phones, can affect posture and put the back under extra strain. As gadgets get smaller, users lean over them more, putting the neck and shock-absorbing discs that cushion the vertebrae under added pressure. The fashion for hot-desking, in which office workers don't have an assigned desk of their own, adds to the problem because the chair is not adjusted to suit them. The survey of more than 2,100 Britons aged 16-plus also revealed just how sedentary modern life is. Almost two-thirds said they spend most of their working day sitting. And the average Briton spends almost three hours in front of the TV each evening. In all, we typically spend ten hours a day sitting. Chiropractor Tim Hutchful of the BCA said: 'We're seeing a rise in the number of people experiencing back and neck-related problems because our modern lifestyle is forcing us to stay seated and I'm concerned that the number of patients under the age of 30 coming through our doors is increasing. 'Whether at your desk, on your tablet or watching TV, it's really important to take breaks to relieve the build-up of tension in your back.'\n"]}

The former US Open champion, 44, carded a superb final round eight-under-par 63 which included six birdies on his first nine holes to move ahead of overnight leader Troy Merritt, whose three-shot lead evaporated with a 69 on Sunday, when play was started early because of fears over the weather. However, it was not enough to see off Kisner, who also tied at 18 under when he sank a birdie with his final putt. US veteran Jim Furyk celebrates after completing victory at the RBC Heritage .

Furyk revealed his delight at ending his title drought, telling the PGA Tour website: 'I've let so many slide by, I really dug deep today and I'm happy I got it done.' He admitted he rode his luck on the front nine, where he approached the turn on six under for his round despite several way ward shots. 'I hit a bad drive at two, I hit a bad second shot at two, I hit about 14 trees down the right side and I hit a nine iron to two feet and made birdie,' he said. 'I tugged it off three, it's going way left - where I'm going to get blocked out - and it hits a tree and drops on the fairway, I knock a five iron on to the green. 'Then I tugged it off the fifth tee really bad, hit a tree and dropped down in front of the lake instead of going in the lake and turned that into a par. 'At that point I'm thinking 'I've got to start hitting the ball a little bit better here but things are going my way'. I kind of righted the ship for six through 10 and felt a little bit better about my swing and putts were going in left and right on that front nine. 'I really didn't hit it that well to shoot 30 on the front (nine), I know it sounds funny but I just made everything.'

{"question_id": 788, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: To hear Leigh Griffiths tell it, the intervention staged by Celtic boss Ronny Deila and assistant John Collins was definitely closer to a kick in the what-nots than it was a pat on the back. Whatever the detail of the conversation, and however lasting the effects may be, the short-term impact on the 24-year-old force of nature \u2014 often as unruly and unpredictable as a whirlwind \u2014 has been nothing short of remarkable. As the kid himself puts it: \u2018Being top scorer now means that, since I have had a talk with the manager, I have knuckled down and proved him wrong, proved JC wrong and shown that I deserve to be here.\u2019 Hat-trick hero Leigh Griffiths with signed match ball and man of the match award . Rather revealing, isn\u2019t it? Clearly demanding Deila and original gym rat Collins did not hold back in dealing with the gifted but wild natural talent, wielding a big stick in a bid to persuade Griffiths that the carrot wasn\u2019t such a bad alternative to chips and tea cakes. \u2018I had to improve,\u2019 admits the former Hibs star. \u2018I wasn\u2019t playing at the start of the season. I had a talk with the manager and John Collins about everything and about what they wanted me to do. \u2018Thankfully, in the two months since the turn of the year, I have knuckled down and they are seeing the rewards now. \u2018What did they say to me? I had to be working hard in the gym and working hard to get my fitness levels up. I did that and I have been bang on form since the turn of the year. \u2018When I was at Hibs, I would have been the first name on the team sheet given the goals I scored. \u2018But coming here, it\u2019s a massive club and, with the new manager coming into the club, he wanted to impose his own philosophy. \u2018Playing one up front, you have to work hard and my fitness levels were not up to his standards. Since January, though, my fitness levels have been good and I have been scoring goals. \u2018I was brought to Celtic to score goals and I\u2019ve started to do that since the turn of the year. I haven\u2019t set any new targets \u2014 but I do want a good run of games. \u2018I want to be starting every game from now until the end of the season and score as many goals as I possibly can. Celtic's Leigh Griffiths (right) completes his hat-trick against\u00a0Kilmarnock . \u2018The manager selects the team he thinks is best to win the game and we have boys in the squad and coming on from the bench. \u2018Myself, Anthony Stokes, Stuart Armstrong, Gary Mackay-Steven were all on the bench against Kilmarnock.\u2019 Griffiths is making a stronger case than most by banging in the goals, his hat-trick in Wednesday night\u2019s 4-1 home win over Kilmarnock definitely ranking among the better substitute performances the Scottish game has seen this season. His second treble haul in Celtic colours took his total for the season to 15 goals, the majority of those coming in 2015, as he has contended more frequently with John Guidetti, Stefan Scepovic and Anthony Stokes for the lone striker\u2019s role favoured \u2014 for now, at least \u2014 by Deila. Watching Guidetti amble around aimlessly until Griffiths arrived to partner the big Swede on Wednesday night, it definitely seems as though Deila has only two options for Sunday\u2019s Scottish Cup semi-final against Inverness. Either he plays both in a traditional front-pairing. Or he lets Griffiths, scorer of an early opener against Caley Thistle in the Highlands last weekend, loose on his own at Hampden. If his midweek goals explosion makes it impossible to omit the former Livingston, Dundee and Wolves striker from the starting XI, his record in major semi-finals at the national stadium also counts in his favour. Substitute Griffiths came off the bench to spark Celtic into life after lacklustre first-half . The extra-time hero as he scored his second of the game to ease Hibs past Falkirk 4-3 at this stage of the Scottish Cup two years ago, Griffiths also opened the scoring for Celtic against Rangers in the League Cup semi earlier this season. \u2018I\u2019ve played in two semi-finals at Hampden and I have won two,\u2019 he points out. \u2018Hopefully, I can continue that. \u2018I\u2019ll be looking to score again. But the most important thing is for the team to win the game and reach the Scottish Cup Final. \u2018Inverness will come down and make it difficult for us. They proved last weekend they are a hard team to beat. \u2018Every game against them this season has been tight and I expect the same again on Sunday.\u2019 If Griffiths starts and plays as he did against Killie, even Caley Thistle at their most obdurate will struggle to cope. His hat-trick \u2014 one perfectly placed header, one absolute screamer from distance and a driven low finish \u2014 was a timely reminder of what he can do, when the mood is upon him. Celtic manager Ronny Deila (left) congratulates Griffiths after the final whistle . \u2018It wasn\u2019t a bad night\u2019s work,\u2019 he says with a smile. \u2018It was just good to get the win because we were disappointed not to win at Inverness last weekend. And we had suffered a setback, going 1-0 down to Kilmarnock, although the boys fought back in the right way. \u2018All of the goals were my favourites. The first one was a great ball into the box by Kris Commons and I managed to head it down into the net. \u2018The second one went in off the post and I was just waiting for the whistle to go for being offside for the third. Thankfully, it didn\u2019t come and I fired it back across the goalkeeper. \u2018It\u2019s only my third hat-trick in senior football, so it\u2019s decent. My second one came for Celtic against Inverness last year.\u2019 Cute move, dropping that into conversation. Take note, gaffer? Not only am I bang in form, not only do I have a great record at Hampden, but I\u2019ve shown I can do the business against Inverness. Celtic start as favourites on Sunday and, with Hibs also edging the odds in their semi against Falkirk, Griffiths could spend May 30 torn between professional pride and genuine love for his hometown team. Asked outright if he would like to face Hibernian, balancing up the desire to become a Treble winner against the need to condemn his boyhood heroes to at least one more year of Scottish Cup taunts, Griffiths admitted: \u2018Honest answer, no! \u2018If they get there, it will be great for the club, but I\u2019m just concentrating on doing my job for Celtic. We are eight points clear in the league and in a good position and, obviously, we want to go for the Treble. \u2018There is still a long way to go and we have difficult games coming up. At the moment, Inverness are standing in our way of having a potentially great season.\u2019\n"]}

According to the report, household names like CBS, General Electric and Mattel all successfully manipulated the U.S. tax code to avoid paying taxes on their massive profits. Even more shocking: some of them even received tax rebates in the tens or even hundreds of millions. Avoidance: Fifteen Fortune 500 companies managed to get through 2014 without owing a penny in income taxes. What's more, most of those 15 were actually given federal tax rebates in the tens or even hundreds of millions . CBS made\u00a0$1.8 billion in U.S. profits last year and received a $235 million tax rebate . To put this harsh reality into perspective, imagine you're a taxpayer logged on to a tax site in your struggle to determine what you owe Uncle Sam. You pay upwards of $100 every month for the internet you're using and could well owe thousands in income tax. But if your monthly internet payment goes to Time Warner, guess what they'll be paying this year. That's right: zero dollars. In a way, you may have paid them. Again. The frequently maligned cable company made over $4 billion in U.S. profit last year and subsequently received tax rebates totaling $26 million. And, as Fast Company notes, it's all perfectly legal. One method used by these companies is called accelerated depreciation, which means the tax value of an asset may be claimed in the first years of the purchase rather than over time. Another method of tax avoidance is active financing. Put simply, this means a company classifies a taxable activity as foreign financing, putting it out of reach of the IRS. With corporate giants like Pepco, Prudential and Xerox all successfully avoiding paying income tax, Citizens for Tax Justice says American taxpayers and the U.S. government need to wake up and amend the tax code. The report's authors write: . 'As Congress focuses on strategies for revamping the U.S. corporate income tax, a sensible starting point should be to critically assess the costs of each of these tax breaks and to take steps to ensure that profitable corporations pay their fair share of U.S. taxes.' Fair? Citizens for Tax Justice wants changes to the corporate tax code and released a report last week that lists the Fortune 500 corporations that managed to squeak by in 2014 without paying a dime in income tax . Jetblue, PG&E, PEPCO Holdings and Ryder used accelerated depreciation, a tax break that allows companies to write off the cost of their capital investments much faster than these investments wear out, to dramatically reduce their tax rates . Priceline relied heavily on a single tax break \u2014 writing off the value of executive stock options for tax purposes \u2014 to zero out its tax liability not just in 2014 but in 2013, 2012 and 2011 as well. In addition, the company admits that this tax break could offset all taxes on up to $1.2 billion in profits going forward. Mattel also reports enjoying $140 million in stock option tax breaks over the past five years. Qualcomm has enjoyed more than $290 million in research and development tax breaks over the past three years. The R&E tax credit has been criticized for rewarding companies for \u201cresearch\u201d they would have done anyway, as well as rewarding research in areas such as fast-food packaging. General Electric uses the active financing\u00a0tax break as one of many ways that it eliminates its U.S. income tax bill. This arcane tax break allows some multinational financial institutions to avoid paying income taxes to any government on their international financing activities.

But one chemistry lecturer draws on her own skin, due to an unusual medical condition. Dr Zoe Waller, 31, who teaches pharmacy at the University of East Anglia, suffers from the skin condition dermatographia. This is a type of urticaria, or hives - where a raised, itchy rash appears on the skin at the slightest pressure. It is thought to be caused when the cells under the surface of the skin release histamines as part of an allergic reaction, causing the skin to swell. Dr Zoe Waller, 31, is a university lecturer and uses her own skin to teach her students about new drugs and molecules, as she suffers from the skin condition dermatographia . Whenever Dr Waller draws on the skin, her condition means raised red  weals appear and she can create designs. She uploads them to social media and they are making waves across the university . However instead of hiding away her condition, Dr Waller is using it as a teaching aid. Her students are required to learn 100 drugs for their course and each day, she will draw a new one on her skin. Word of the unusual teaching method has spread across the university as well as social media where Dr Waller uploads her quirky designs. She said: 'I was only diagnosed with this two years ago and it's a pretty cool condition to have. 'Some people look at my arm and think I've been self-harming but it doesn't hurt at all. 'I use a blunt pencil or cocktail stick to create the detail needed for the composition of the drugs.' Dermographism or 'skin writing' is a type of urticaria, or hives - where a raised, itchy rash appears on the skin. Dermatographia is thought to be caused when the cells under the surface of the skin release histamines under the slightest pressure. Histamines are chemicals released in the body as part of an allergic reaction, causing the skin to swell. In this type of urticaria, itchy weals occur after friction such as rubbing or stroking the skin. This itching may be aggravated by heat. Weals and red marks also often appear as lines at the sites of scratching, and generally last for less than one hour.' Antihistamines block the effect of histamine, and reduce itching and the rash in most people, but may not relieve urticaria completely. If urticaria occurs frequently, it is best to take antihistamines regularly every day. The lecturer discovered her unusual skin condition after she started working at the University's school of pharmacy. She noticed her skin was itchy and irritated but the doctor couldn't remember the name of the condition he thought she had and sent her away with anti-histamines. She said: 'I was left confused after visiting the doctor. Then my friend in America sent me a link to Ariana Russell's work and I knew then that was what I had.' Ariana Russell is an artist in the USA who uses her own body and dermatographia to create artwork. Inspired by Ariana, Dr Waller set to work on her own project - creating science molecules and compounds for her students using her skin. Her students and fellow professors often ask her for requests which she happily draws on her skin. Dr Waller said: 'My skin might not be like this forever but it's a fun and unusual way of teaching my students and it grabs their attention a lot more than a text book would.' Dr Tabi Leslie, from the British Association of Dermatologists, explained that dermographism or 'skin writing' is a type of urticaria. She said: 'Raised red weals, which are caused by the release of histamine from cells in the skin called mast cells, appear at sights of friction, such as rubbing or stroking of the skin. 'This itching may also be aggravated by heat. 'Weals and red marks often appear as lines at the sites of scratching, and generally last for less than one hour. 'Antihistamines are used to reduce the itch and the rash, and are effective in most patients. People across the university have began to make requests for designs they want Dr Waller to draw on herself . 'However, antihistamines may not relieve the symptoms completely in all cases. 'In such cases, other treatments may need to be used in addition, or higher dosages of antihistamines may be prescribed than licensed recommendations suggest. 'Sufferers of dermographism may need to take antihistamines on a daily basis, as long as the symptoms persists. Usually, the non-sedating antihistamines are preferred as they have fewer side effects. 'Treatment needs to continue until the condition settles by itself which may take years. 'Your doctor will advise you on the best regime depending on the severity of your symptoms.'

Following one stunning round with another happens about as often at Augusta National as pieces of litter drifting across the property. Here, the youngest first-round leader in Masters history followed his 64 with a 66 to set a new 36-hole record total of 14 under par, beating the old mark of 13 under set by Ray Floyd way back in 1976. It also tied the lowest 36-hole total seen in a major, set by three others, including Sir Nick Faldo at The Open. Jordan Spieth chips on the 17th hole during the second round of the Masters on Friday . Spieth watches his tee shot from the 16th in front of a packed crowd at Augusta . The 21-year-old walks past the scoreboard on the 18th hole following his sensational performance . Dustin Johnson eyes up a putt no the 18th green during his record-breaking display on Friday . Johnson started with a double bogey but positively pillaged the course\u2019s scoreable par fives to devastating effect. He had eagles at the second and the 8th, birdied the 13th, before striking a wondrous blow to the 15th that pulled up 12 inches from the flag. The difference between him and Spieth is he makes far more errors and one at the last meant he had to settle for a 67. Johnson will start the third round seven behind his fellow American with game chorus line member Charley Hoffman two strokes nearer the lead following a creditable 68. Gutsy Englishmen Justin Rose and Paul Casey are on the same mark as Johnson, with the former weighing in with a fine recovery of his own. Rose was three over par after four holes but rallied strongly after drawing a line on his scorecard, like you\u2019d draw a line in the sand. He played the last 14 holes in a plucky five under for a 70, while Casey underlined he is a man reborn with a terrific bogey-free 68. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68, one shot ahead of Ernie Els (72), while Tiger Woods shot a commendable 69, his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors, and his first here since 2011. He is still no fewer than 12 shots behind, mind. What of the world No 1, Rory McIlroy? Alas, if it\u2019s Friday it must be time for one of those freaky nine holes that just kill him at the Masters every time. Ernie Els hits a shot off the fourth tee during his second day of action . Last year it was on the back nine and this time the outward half, as he followed a bogey at the 7th with a double at the 9th to turn in 40 strokes. It\u2019s the sixth year in a row the Northern Irishman has thrown in a horrific nine like this and until he addresses the problem, he simply cannot win a green jacket. At least on the back nine he showed the pride of a current double major champion and the improvement he has made mentally from the days when his shoulders used to slump. One shot outside the projected halfway cut mark, he birdied the 10th and then, at the 13th, the hole that has given him so much trouble in the past, he hit his second shot to 3ft for a tap-in eagle three. McIlroy missed from 3ft at the 14th for a par but, in a rousing finish, birdied the 15th, 17th and the 18th. To the accompaniment of loud rumbles of thunder in the distance, McIlroy came home in just 31 shots to stand alongside Woods on two under. Tiger Woods shot a commendable 69; his first score in the sixties in 15 rounds in majors . Woods's girlfriend\u00a0Lindsey Vonn watches on from the crowd during the second day of action . Texas golfers have a long and proud history of coming up with prodigious feats that stun the sporting world. Byron Nelson once won 11 events in a row on the PGA Tour in 1945. Ben Hogan won three major championships in succession in 1953 and probably would have won the fourth as well but for the fact The Open clashed that year with the USPGA. Now here comes Spieth, who to this point has turned this Masters into his very own \u2018hello, world\u2019 moment with an awesome demonstration of dominance the like of which we haven\u2019t seen since another 21-year-old named Tiger walked away with the 1997 edition. All this on the day another Lone Star legend, Ben Crenshaw, waved goodbye to the Masters. It\u2019s tempting to talk about a passing of the Texas torch, except Spieth is destined for a level of greatness twice Masters champion Crenshaw could only dream about. Think Hogan rather than Gentle Ben. Rory McIlroy reacts to a poor second shot on the fifth hole in what was a frustrating day for the World No 1 . Paul Casey tries to clear out of a bunker on the eighth hole . As for Tiger, his first round 73 was actually an awful lot better than his score and the reviews suggested. It was, in fact, the most encouraging signs we\u2019ve seen for him for well over a year. His short game was back to its best and his task on Friday was to instil some rhythm in his long game. That is exactly what happened. The rare sight of him finding the first fairway was encouraging and even better was the laser iron that followed. It finished 10ft away and the birdie putt found the middle of the hole. For 15 minutes, it was like watching Tiger at his best. The rest of the round was also heartening. He reached the turn in 34 to be one under for the event and inside the top 20. Justin Rose flips his club into the air after the English golfer cleared a sand trap on the 13th green . Ben Crenshaw closed out his Masters career with two mediocre rounds at Augusta . A birdie at the 11th and he was on the fringes of the top ten. How he does over the final two rounds is one more fascinating question during a weekend featuring many. Els was trying to build on the small miracle of his opening 67. The South African finished eighth on his Augusta National debut in 1994. Two months later, at the age of 25, he claimed the United States Open. Everyone looked at his languid grace off the tee and gossamer touch around the greens and wondered how many green jackets he would win. Twenty years on, he\u2019s still waiting for his first. But he\u2019s still in there trying. Depending on your viewpoint, his 72 leaves him perfectly placed to take advantage if Spieth feels the pressure over the weekend; or well in the mix to notch his third runner-up finish at the Masters. Phil Mickelson lies tied sixth after a 68 just one shot ahead of Els .\n"]}

Moya Gerber was travelling in her vehicle through the Kruger National Park, South Africa, when she spotted a male and female lion trying to bring down a Cape Buffalo. Moya's sister Rone Odendaal, 24, who is a teacher at\u00a0Laerskool Lothair, located in the village of Lothair, began taking pictures of the struggle, before noticing the buffalo was heading for the road. Battle:\u00a0Moya Gerber and her sister Rone Odendaal, 24, spotted this struggle between two lions and a buffalo in the Kruger National Park in South Africa, so they stopped to photograph it . Collision: After a few moments the buffalo managed to escape the lions' clutches, but headed straight for the road instead before running into the side of Ms Odendaal's car . While the beast managed to escape being eaten by the lions, it did receive a nasty knock to the head after running into the side of their van. Speaking to MailOnline, Ms Odendaal, who uploaded the pictures to her Instagram, said: 'We were on holiday. We go to the park a couple of times every year but this is the first time something like this has happened. 'It was on the third day of a five day trip in the morning that we saw the buffalo.\u00a0We were on the h3 road, going from the from Malelane satellite camp  towards Skukuza camp. 'It started when we saw two male lions just past abridge heading towards a waterhole. 'They got a drink of water and then slept under bushes on our left hand side and then we spotted the buffalo on our right side. 'The wind was in the lions favour, they jumped up in unison and walked fast over the road towards the buffalo.They looked really hungry and needed food, that's when the action started. 'The lions stalked the buffalo before one jumped on its back. That lion held on for almost 30 minutes until the buffalo ran towards the cars. It's horn punctured a car wheel which gave the lion a fright. 'The other male lion got thrown through the air but came back and also started biting the buffalo by its tail. We could smell the blood. Life or death: Miss\u00a0Odendaal, a teacher from the village of\u00a0Lothair, captured these images of the beasts fighting with one-another before the buffalo crashed into her vehicle . Explain that to the insurers! A fully grown buffalo can weigh up to 1,750lbs - about half the weight of a VW Golf - and stands six foot tall, meaning it left quite a dent in the car's door . 'Just before the lions could bring the buffalo down it punctured the car wheel and then ran into our car taking the mirror off. 'I was in the car with my sister and her two children, one-year-old Hendri, and Lisa who is four. 'The children started crying after the buffalo hit the car but we told them to sit really still. 'I hoped that the lions would manage to bring the buffalo down in order to feed. They need to eat as well but other people were screaming for the poor buffalo. 'I\u00a0gained even more respect for lions watching this with my own eyes the perseverance it takes to try and bring it down and the buffalo really hurt them running through the bush with them.' She also revealed that the unlucky buffalo caused around \u00a311,000 worth of damage to the car. Nadav Ossendryver, the founder of\u00a0Latest Sightings, a website that tracks animals in the Kruger park, uploaded the pictures last week and said it was something he'd never seen before. Ms Odendaal's friends also joked about the close-shave on Facebook, with Jeremy Hallett quipping: 'Explain that to your insurance!' The Kruger National Park spans 7,500 square miles of territory in the north east of South Africa along its border with Mozambique, making it one of the largest game reserves in Africa. One of a kind: When Miss Odendaal's images were uploaded to website for spotting wildlife in the Kruger park, it's founder said he had never seen anything like it before . The park is home to more 12,000 elephants, 1,000 leopards, 2,800 lions, and 27,000 African Buffalo, with the climate ranging from savanna scrubland in the south, to tropical in the north. The buffalo that call the park home can reach heights of six foot and weigh around 1,750lbs - or around half the weight of a VW Golf. The male African lion, pictured here, reaches an adult weight of just under 500lbs, making it the second largest big cat after the tiger, but still nowhere near as large as the buffalo.\n"]}

A coroner has raised concerns over the lack of swimming lessons included in the national curriculum after a 15-year-old drowned in a river on the first day of his summer holidays. Rony John, 15, died after jumping into the River Great Ouse in Hartford, Cambridgeshire, despite being unable to swim. At an inquest into his death, the coroner said she would now write to Government chiefs to ask why swimming is not included in secondary school education. The hearing heard that swimming is compulsory during primary school but is not enforced for those aged 11 or over. Assistant Cambridgeshire Coroner Belinda Cheney said: 'Swimming is not a difficult skill to learn yet it is a critical life skill.' The hearing heard how Rony was\u00a0with friends on the bank of the river in July last year when he dived into the water. When it was clear he was in difficulty, Rony's friends desperately tried to rescue the teenager. A group of adults also attempted to bring the young boy to safety, while firefighters arrived at the scene within ten minutes. But an inquest heard how Rony was swept away by the current and would have died within four minutes of jumping into the water. His body was not found until the following day. The hearing, which took place in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, heard how Rony came to Britain from India in 2012 and did not know how to swim. According to his headteacher, Mr Bennet said he had been eligible for six 30-minute lessons a year at St. Peter's School in Huntingdon. But Christopher Bennet said that he had also been excused from some of the sessions after taking notes to school, written by his family, requesting he not take part. Just weeks after Rony's death, the school also cancelled swimming lessons for all older pupils. After the hearing, Mr Bennet said: 'Rony came to school at the beginning of year eight. As his family said in the inquest he needed help to stay afloat. The teenager was swimming with friends in the Great River Ouse at Hatford, Cambridgeshire in July last year . Firefighters were on the scene within ten minutes and his friends also tried to bring Rony to safety, but the young man could not be saved . 'Pupils of his age were entitled to six half-an-hour lessons a year and we know that for all of the lessons that took place he was in school. 'We know that he attended some of those lessons but he also came in with notes which could have come from the family stating that he couldn't take part.' He added: 'Swimming is in the national curriculum for primary school pupils but not for those in secondary education. 'We had to cancel lessons for secondary school pupils because of the cost and it would be beneficial to have extra provisions for those students. 'It is a life skill and at the end of the day we live on an island so we are never very far away from water.' Tributes were left at the scene, on the bank of the river, following Rony's death. His headteacher Christopher Bennet said he was a 'hugely popular young man' He added that Rony was a 'hugely popular young man' and there were plans for a memorial cricket match on the first anniversary of his death. Rony's father John Thomas, from Huntingdon, told the inquest: 'He was extremely well-behaved. He was always a good boy.' Yesterday,\u00a0Moses Yitzchok Greenfeld, 19, from Stamford Hill, London, drowned in Hampstead Heath pond after going for a swim with four friends in the 25C heat. His body was eventually discovered five foot below the surface and 20ft from the water's edge just before 11pm on Wednesday - nearly six hours after he was reported in trouble at 5.30pm. It is thought Mr Greenfield may have had a cardiac arrest because of the shock of jumping into the cold water. It has since been claimed that police officers 'watched' as the desperately tried to save their friend. An eyewitness has said at least seven police officers stood on a bank and watched as the boys dived in and out looking for their friend.\n"]}
{"question_id": 796, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Host commentator . Wow. Real Madrid haven't got going tonight (I was about to write a post about how Barcelona were 5-0 up at this point) but James Rodriguez produces a bit of individual magic to opening the scoring. The ball bounces up to the Colombian who unleashes a stunning left-footed volley, dipping over the goalkeeper and into the top corner at some speed. That was very World Cup-esque, if you don't mind me saying. 39mins: As bad as Real have been, credit must go to Almeria. Their work rate has been exceptional while they are passing and moving, not exactly looking like a side who are \u00a0sitting just above the relegation zone. They have completed 184 passes so far today, which is a decent stat given it's not even half time yet. 31mins: But still, it's the visitors who are getting in behind more than Real. There are a few whistles in the crowd, and that's about the only atmosphere there is at this point. Things may get better now though, it's Ronaldo time again with the dead ball... but oh dear. That sums it all up, a limp effort rises way over the crossbar. 27mins: Uh oh. Free-kick time. James is clipped from 30 yards out and Ronaldo is licking his lips. Can he spark this game into life? Nearly! A swerving effort from left to right, the keeper is beaten but the ball doesn't quite dip in time and lands on the roof of the net. 24mins: Again, nice play from Almeria! Thomas, on loan from Atletico, shows his skills down the right before cutting the ball back for Corona, who fluffs his lines. Definitely a half chance for the visitors. Real need to wake up. 19mins: Considering the pace Barcelona were playing at last night this is pretty, er... slow. Real haven't found their rhythm yet while Almeria are just letting them pass from side to side. 15mins: Few more shots for the visitors, but they're both from around 25 yards and Keylor Navas won't be worried by those. Still, they're getting forward while leaving enough men back to fend against what could be a devastating counter attack. 12mins: Better from Almeria. They've won two out of their last three and are trying to bring some of that confidence into this one. Some sloppy passing from Illarramendi almost leads to a chance, as top scorer Hemed looks to get on the end of a cross. 7mins: Three shots already for the hosts, with Ronaldo having the latest two. No goals? Come on Cristiano! First, he runs at the Almeria defence but his left-footed strike is straight at the keeper who flicks it behind - and then from the resulting corner he rises highest but that's ballooned over the bar. 3mins: Almeria have quite a bit of the ball early on but unsurprisingly it's Real who almost force the opening. Javier Hernandez gets space down the left flank and his first time ball is just inches away from Cristiano Ronaldo at the back post. Soon after James meets Arbeloa's drilled cross from the right, but the goalkeeper can watch that one wide. Ominous signs for the visitors with all this space early on though... Away we go! Real Madrid kicking from left to right in the first half. The sun is shining at the Bernabeu, where Odegaard came out prior to kick-off to take a picture. Cute.\u00a0Minutes until kick-off now, Madrid will be hoping to follow Barca's lead and turn on the style too. Both sets of players wearing 'Todos Con Nepal' t-shirts in\u00a0support of the victims of the Nepal earthquake, and there will also be a minute's silence. Under the terms set out by Manchester United when they loaned the 26-year-old to Madrid, Thursday April 30 marks the end of the Spanish club's 'exclusivity period' to buy the player. So, will he impress tonight? Real Madrid have scored 21 goals in their last four games against Almeria, including an 8-1 victory at the Bernabeu two years ago. Carlo Ancelotti has made nine changes tonight with\u00a0\u00a0Iker Casillas, Dani Carvajal, Sergio Ramos, Marcelo dropping out, though there is still place for Cristiano Ronaldo and Javier Hernandez. And on that note... Real Madrid:\u00a0Navas, Arbeloa, Pepe, Varane, Coentrao, Kroos, Illarramendi, Rodriguez, Ronaldo, Jese, Hernandez . Subs:\u00a0Casillas, Marcelo, Nacho, Lucas Silva, Isco, Odegaard, Mayoral . Almeria:\u00a0Ruben, Ximo, Trujillo, Mauro, Mane, Verza, Thomas, Corona, Dubarbier, Hemed, Edgar . Subs:\u00a0Julian, Casado, Jonathan, Sanchez, Espinosa, Marin, Azeez . Referee:\u00a0Ignacio Iglesias Villanueva . It may only be a home clash against lowly Almeria, but tonight could be the biggest night of a 16-year-old's life. Norwegian wonderkid Martin Odegaard has been named on the bench for this evening's La Liga game and may make his debut. Before that though, there is the small matter of Real closing the gap on archrivals Barcelona. Team news coming up. Pressure is on Real Madrid as they aim to narrow the five-point gap Barcelona have opened up at the top of La Liga. Barca hammered Getafe 6-0 on Tuesday to extend their lead at the La Liga summit, but Madrid will hope to reel in their rivals with victory over a struggling Almeria team. Carlo Ancelotti has named Martin Odegaard on the Madrd bench, with the 16-year-old set to make his club debut at the Bernabeu, so follow Sportsmail's coverage of all the action here.\n"]}

{"question_id": 799, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Have you ever found the creative inspiration you were seeking at the most unexpected time, or thought you were having that long-awaited problem-solving epiphany just as you nodded off to sleep? According to neuroscientists John Kounios and Mark Beeman, there's a reason for that. Their book, \"The Eureka Factor\", explores the influences at work behind that much sought-after \"Aha!\" moment. Research suggests that in trying to conjure up inspiration, most of us end up suppressing it. The book explains how to clear out mental junk, in order to make way for pivotal revelations. Dr. Kounios explained: \"Insights involve unusual connections. Cognitive psychologists call these 'remote associations'. They are processed mostly in the brain's right hemisphere. Insights occur when a subconscious remote association suddenly pops into awareness. This is accompanied by a burst of activity in the brain's right temporal lobe.\" \"We wrote \"The Eureka Factor\" to help people understand how creative insight works in the brain so they can use various strategies harmoniously without having them cross-circuit each other, \" said Kounios. \"For example, there is evidence that imagining the future helps to put someone in an insightful state. However, if a person imagines a specific future that makes them anxious, then insightfulness could decrease because anxiety is a creativity killer.\" \"That said, a positive mood and a broad, expansive spread of attention are a couple of key features of the insightful state,\" he added. Following are some of the tips they suggest for unleashing your creative potential -- both at home and at work. Spaciousness helps broaden thoughts. Even high ceilings have been shown to broaden attention. Small, windowless offices, low ceilings and narrow corridors will do little to inspire our brains and make us flexible, creative thinkers. Relaxing outdoor colors such as blue and green contribute to this state. \"Emergency\" colors such as red suppress it. Surprisingly, dark colors and dim lighting can also be beneficial: by obscuring visual details, they help people think more abstractly. Static surroundings encourage static thinking. Don't be predictable. You should sometimes change everyday routines, such as where you go for coffee or your route to work. Rearrange your furniture and decor from time to time, at home and in your workplace. Hold meetings in a variety of places. Make sure to include some nonconformists in your inner circle. Unusual people tend to be out-of-the-box thinkers, and their unique outlook might help you attack a problem from a different angle. The threat of a firm deadline will narrow your thinking and inhibit your insight. Try and use soft target dates and a flexible schedule to establish a helpful, nonthreatening time frame. Rewards and punishments for meeting or missing deadlines, if needed at all, should be vague and mild so they don't contribute added pressure. A positive outlook will help stimulate a more open mind, one that can process a greater number of ideas. If you struggle to think happy, try focusing on the people and things that bring you joy. To put a twist on Pasteur's famous saying, chance favors the happy mind. When you're stuck on a problem, take a break to do or think about something very different. Expose yourself to a variety of people and places. Listen to music or go to a pleasing movie, art exhibit or talk a walk. Play a game, dance, do yoga, read. Insight triggers appear at the most unlikely times and places. We all know how important sleep is to our cognitive thinking. The sleep-deprived mind is more likely to fixate on small matters -- an absolute killer to creativity. Ample sleep also helps foster the discovery of hidden connections between ideas. Insightful thought is at its best when your powers of inhibition are weaker, because reduced focus opens up your awareness to remote associations that wouldn't come to you when you're feeling sharp. If you're an early bird, you should try doing your creative work at night. If you're a night owl, try the morning. Perhaps the single most important thing to remember is that your mental state can change. It takes a while to sink into an insightful mindset. Try and schedule uninterrupted blocks of time for relaxed, freewheeling creative thought. Turn off your phone. Get rid of the clock. Let abstract ideas and vague impressions flow where they will. Tips have been extracted from the book \"The Eureka Factor\", which has been written by Dr. John Kounios and Dr. Mark Beeman. How missing sleep can damage your IQ .

And with a world gold medal still proving elusive, the 32-year-old Adams insists she has absolutely no plan to set a time-scale on when it will finally be time to hang up her golden gloves. British boxer Nicola Adams is hoping to become a double Olympic gold medallist in Rio . Adams (right, pictured during her London 2012 final win over Cancan Ren) is hoping to retain her crown . Adams said: 'I will keep fighting as long as I have the motivation to do so and there is no reason why that should not continue after the Rio Olympics. 'At the moment becoming a double Olympic champion is the only thing on my mind but I have other goals left to achieve including world gold after only taking three silvers so far. 'Despite all my injury problems I have never lost my love for the sport and as long as I keep that love of fighting and entertaining the crowd I will still be eager to compete.' Adams will face a rare challenge to her domestic dominance in Liverpool with her 51kg category also including Lisa Whiteside, who won world silver in Adams' absence earlier this year. Natasha Jonas, pictured in blue at London 2012, announced her retirement from boxing on April 7 . The Preston fighter has boiled down to the flyweight division in order to challenge for Adams' Olympic spot and they should go head-to-head for the first time in next Sunday's final. But Adams, who underwent shoulder surgery earlier this year, warned: 'I am feeling really good - my speed and timing have returned and I feel like a whole new fighter. 'I had to change my style for the Commonwealth Games because I had to hide just how much of a problem my shoulder was causing, but I came through it and took the gold medal. 'Now it is not giving me any problems at all so I can revert to the way I have always fought and hopefully the fans in Liverpool will be able to see me at my best.'\n"]}

They become even more awe-inspiring at the realisation that they're paintings, and someone spent between 50 to 300 hours painstakingly creating them. Patrick Kramer is a 33-year-old artist hailing from Springville, Utah, who specialises in remarkably hyper-realistic paintings. Scroll down for video . Action shot: The artwork of 33-year-old Patrick Kramer is so realistic it's impossible to tell apart from a photo. In this image, he has painted a falling woman with a deeply intricate background . The US artist specialises in beautifully in-depth oil painted portraits, including this intricate black and white portrait of a man called Matt . The paintings, including this of a sleeping young girl called Anna, take the artist up to 50 to 300 hours to complete . It's almost impossible to tell that Kramer's flawless creations are in fact oil paintings due to their incredible pin-sharp detail and clarity. His portrayals vary between vivid city scenes, still-life objects, portraits and breathtaking motion-shots. As well as his portfolio of hyper-realistic paintings, he also constructs more surreal variations on still life, involving insects or inanimate objects in front of a background. One of his images is an imitation of the cover art for musician Drake's 2013 album, Nothing Was the Same. Kramer also paints highly-detailed urban shots, which are impossible to tell apart from a photo . His technique involves building layers of oil paint in order to achieve the intense level of detail . The US artist works from photos and builds up delicate layers of oil paint on a board or canvas. This allows him to add controlled detail and subtle shadowing, which appear almost three-dimensional in the pieces of artwork. Kramer has admitted that an oil painting can take anywhere between 50 to 300 hours (one to six weeks) to complete. The length of time taken depends entirely on the size of the painting and the level of detail.\u00a0The 33-year-old artist has admitted that this type of artwork suits his precise preferences and personality. Kramer also constructs more surreal imagery of insects, which all still have the same high level of detail - including (left) a dragonfly on an intricate background, and (right)\u00a0Kramer's painting of a butterfly resting on a wad of letters . Cracks in the surface: The artist, from Utah, specialises in creating exceptionally-realistic works of art. In this case, it is a paintbrush against a background of cracked paint . Kramer said: 'Being a perfectionist, I have always been considering art as an outlet for my slightly obsessive personality. The artist's background and education was also important in honing his interests. 'I studied painting in college, and experimented with hyper realism as a way of perfecting my craft. 'I never intended to pursue the style, but found it hard to give up, as it suited my nature.' Kramer's artwork - including this painting of half-filled glasses - is astounding in its level of clarity . Glass half full or half empty? This painting is incredibly detailed, from the fine fish fins to the bubble floating at the top of the glass . Kramer's paintings can vary between still-life of subjects such as paint-brushes (left) and detailed portrayals, such as this harbour (right) Nothing Was the Same: This painting imitates the album cover art for Drake's 2013 album, but swaps Drake for a female model .\n"]}

Gone, show organizers hope, will be the scantily-clad \"car babes\" that in previous years have posed provocatively on car hoods and sashayed through the aisles to draw crowds to the 9-day event. The focus, instead, will be the latest offerings from an array of global car manufacturers, which -- models or not -- are pulling out all the stops to compete for Chinese customers in what since 2009 has been the world's largest car market. \"It's a major industry event for us,\" said Andrew Boyle, global product communications manager at Rolls Royce. It sells several hundred of its super-luxury vehicles in China each year, and in Shanghai this week will launch its latest model, the Phantom Limelight. Vehicle sales in China totaled 23.5 million units last year, almost a third more than in the United States. However, the show comes at a turning point for China's auto market, which is facing a second year of slower growth in 2015 after a decade-long sales and production frenzy. Intense competition for China's drivers means that car manufacturers are increasingly developing vehicles that cater to Chinese preferences. Nissan will use Auto Shanghai 2015 to unveil the Lannia mid-size sedan, which it says has been specially created for \"the rising young Chinese generation.\" The country's gearheads have embraced the SUV or sport utility vehicle, sales of which jumped a third last year, and many will feature in the displays planned by dozens of European, Japanese U.S., South Korea and Chinese automakers. This year MG, once known for its sleek sports cars and now owned by Shanghai Automotive Industries Corp, enters the fray with its first SUV, the GS, while Ford will give two new luxury SUVs their China market debut --  the Lincoln MKX and Lincoln Navigator, the latter favored by hip hop stars. \"The SUV is popular as a first car,\" said Raymond Tsang, a Shanghai-based partner at consultancy Bain & Company. \"If you only have one, you want one that you can commute in and take on a road trip.\" Foreign brands have dominated sales in the past two years, but as they improve product quality and design, local rivals like Geely, which also owns Sweden's Volvo, and Great Wall Motor are clawing back market share, especially when it comes to SUVs. Geely, which already exports to Russia, the Middle East and Africa, is also stepping up its efforts to crack more developed markets. It is preparing to export the Volvo S60 Inscription to the United States from a factory in the southwestern city of Chengdu. It would be the first car made in China to hit U.S showrooms and may pave the way for Chinese brands to shake up the U.S. market like Japanese and Korean car manufacturers did decades earlier. With car ownership still at much lower levels than the U.S. and Europe, China is likely to remain the industry's most important market for decades. However, the breakneck growth may be a thing of the past. In 2014, growth in sales halved to 7% and according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, the slowdown continued in the first three months of this year when sales rose just 3.9%. It comes as the wider economy slows and a prolonged campaign against corruption has hit sales of luxury vehicles, especially brands like Audi that have been the ride of choice for Chinese officials. On top of that, the hassles of car ownership are deterring some potential buyers, as is an awareness of the environmental costs. Congested and chaotic roads, restrictions on the number of new vehicle license plates and a shortage of residential parking space  may trigger a backlash against car ownership, according to a recent report from Bain & Company. \"The car was seen as a status symbol,\" says Pierre-Henri Boutot, a partner at Bain and co-author of the report. \"But now in larger cities they see the hassle and some of these people are thinking of giving up their car.\" Just maybe, China will need those car babes to boost sales after all.\n"]}

Mike Pence, state health officials said on Friday. There are now 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky. That's up from 106 last week, said the Indiana State Department of Health. Health officials who declared an epidemic last month have said they expect the number of cases to rise as more people are tested. But the growing number could put pressure on Pence to extend the 30-day needle exchange program that he approved on March 26. Scroll down for video . More than two weeks into a short-term needle exchange program approved by Gov. Mike Pence, there are now 120 confirmed HIV cases and 10 preliminary positive cases tied to Scott County, about 30 miles north of Louisville, Kentucky . Spokeswoman Kara Brooks said Pence is reviewing reports and recommendations from health officials and will make a decision early next week about extending the program beyond April 25. The Scott County outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered painkiller Opana, health officials have said. The county typically sees about five HIV cases each year. Since Pence approved the temporary needle exchange, 5,322 clean syringes have been provided to 86 participants, health officials said Friday. About 1,400 used syringes have been returned. Brittany Combs, public health nurse for the Scott County Health Department, said the needle-exchange program had 'really picked up a lot this week,' in large part because a mobile unit has been traveling around neighborhoods seeking to get more IV drug users into the program. 'It's that trust factor. You have to gain that trust, and I think we're slowly starting to do that,' Combs said. But the future of the Scott County program, as well as the fate of legislation that would allow needle-exchange programs in other counties, isn't clear. The Scott County outbreak has occurred among intravenous drug users and primarily involves the use of the high-powered prescription painkiller Opana, health officials have said . Pence opposes needle exchanges as an anti-drug policy. Senate President Pro Tem David Long said on Thursday that the emergency exchange for Scott County was 'the right reaction' but wasn't sure if it is the correct approach long-term. Nor was he sure whether the Senate would support legislation sponsored by House Public Health Committee Chairman Ed Clere, R-New Albany, that would allow the 23 Indiana counties with the highest rate-per-population of hepatitis C to establish their own needle-exchange programs. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that between 50 percent and 90 percent of people with hepatitis C are also infected with HIV. Health officials say because of this, high rates of hepatitis C are a key indicator of needle-sharing and a potential HIV outbreak. The House approved the bill on April 7 in a 54-39 vote, and the measure is scheduled for a hearing on Monday in a House-Senate conference committee, which will try to work out a final version for lawmakers to consider before the Legislature's April 29 adjournment deadline. Long said Pence isn't alone in his concerns that needle exchanges could promote drug use instead of prevent it. 'At the same time, you adapt and you evolve based on the world we live in, so we're going to have to see if that requires a pivot for us,' Long said. Medical waste containers stored in preparation for Scott County residents that are looking to exchange used needles. The needle-exchange program was created through an emergency executive order signed last week by Gov. Mike Pence in an attempt to curb the state's largest-ever HIV outbreak . Clere said he appreciates Pence's approval of the short-term needle exchange but that 'it doesn't help in other areas of the state that are at risk for a similar outbreak. It's just not enough.' He said the association between needle exchanges and illegal drug activity makes many people, including lawmakers, uncomfortable. But he thinks the exchange program shouldn't be viewed as anti-drug policy, but as 'a proven and effective harm-reduction policy.' 'We simply can't afford to view this as a short-term problem,' Clere said. Money could also be an issue as lawmakers weigh their options. Since 1989, the federal government has banned public funding of needle exchange programs. Pence's executive order didn't include money for the Scott County program. 'They asked the state agencies to find their own money. How sustainable is that?' said Dr. Beth Meyerson, co-director of the Rural Center for AIDS/STD Prevention at Indiana University. 'There's no evidence that the Pence administration is thinking about this in the long term at all.'\n"]}

Ed Miliband was accused of hypocrisy last night after Labour town halls and MPs were revealed to be hiring thousands of workers on zero-hours contracts. The Labour leader yesterday vowed to end casual employment contracts that \u2018undermine living standards and family life\u2019. But his crackdown, which was intended to regain the political initiative after boosts for the Tories on jobs and incomes, backfired spectacularly. In a disastrous day for Labour\u2019s General Election hopes: . Speaking in Huddersfield, Mr Miliband said a Labour government would legislate to require employers to offer a contract to anyone who had been working regular hours for 12 weeks. He made a stinging attack on both David Cameron and firms that use \u2018exploitative\u2019 contracts which fail to guarantee minimum hours of work. Scroll down for video . \u2018The Conservatives believe by looking after a few big firms and individuals at the top, everyone else will be OK,\u2019 said Mr Miliband. But, far from being the preserve of business, the contracts are\u00a0being routinely used by charities, the public sector and the Labour Party itself. It emerged that 68 Labour MPs had also signed up researchers and other staff on zero-hour contracts in the last two years including shadow health secretary Andy Burnham (right) and shadow chancellor Ed Balls (left) Freedom of information requests circulated by the Conservatives reveal that Labour councils are behind 21,798 zero-hours contracts. In December last year, the director of finance at Doncaster Council admitted to still having 300 relief workers on their books. Among the worst authorities are Wolverhampton, which had 738 staff on zero-hours contracts as of May 2014; Liverpool with 442 as of September 2014; and Ealing with 278 as of January 2015. In an even greater embarrassment, it emerged that 68 Labour MPs had also signed up researchers and other staff on the deals over the past two years. They included shadow health secretary Andy Burnham, shadow chancellor Ed Balls, Mr Miliband\u2019s parliamentary bag carrier Karen Buck and his election supremo Lucy Powell. The Labour politicians said they had been told by the Parliamentary expenses watchdog to use the contracts in order to pay a living wage. Freedom of Information requests found 22,000 zero-hours contracts were handed out by Labour-run councils, including Doncaster (pictured) where Mr Miliband is standing for MP . Tory chairman Grant Shapps said: \u2018It\u2019s the same old hypocrisy from Ed Miliband. 'On the day he generates a load of hot air about zero-hours contracts it emerges that his party is one of the most prolific users of them. \u2018It\u2019s chaos in the Labour Party that would cause chaos for the country. Ed Miliband\u2019s not up to the job because he says one thing and does another. A hung parliament could send financial markets into a tailspin and the pound and shares crashing, experts warned last night. Sterling has already fallen nearly 5 per cent against the US dollar in the past five weeks amid jitters about the outcome of the General Election. George Buckley of Deutsche Bank said: \u2018The 2015 General Election is set to be the most unpredictable for nearly a century. There may be no good outcome for investors.\u2019 David Buik, of stockbroker Panmure Gordon, said: \u2018Markets are incapable of dealing with uncertainty.\u2019 'If you can\u2019t trust him on the basics you can\u2019t trust him to lead the country.\u2019 Conservative candidate Charlie Elphicke added: \u2018This is total hypocrisy from Ed Miliband. 'Labour did nothing about zero-hours contracts during its 13 years in power, and now we learn that Labour MPs and councils use them routinely.\u2019 The spotlight was also turned on a number of startling claims made by Mr Miliband yesterday \u2013 whose speech worsened already bad relations with big business. His suggestion that Britain has an \u2018epidemic\u2019 of zero hours contracts was rubbished by official statistics from the ONS. The ONS had explicitly warned the 697,000 people who reported having a zero-hours contract between October and December 2014 should not be compared with the 586,000 in the previous year. The UK\u2019s official statistician said: \u2018It is not possible to say how much of this increase is due to greater recognition of the term zero-hours contracts rather than new contracts.\u2019 However, Mr Miliband still made the claim the centre-piece of his headline grabbing announcement yesterday. The organisation Full Fact said the Labour leader\u2019s claims were unjustified. The Tories say they have tightened the law to end abuse of zero-hours. Employers can no longer insist on \u2018exclusivity\u2019 deals which ban staff from working for other firms. Last week David Cameron said he could not live on an \u2018exploitative zero-hours contract\u2019. Labour MP Karen Buck (left) and Mr Miliband's election supremo Lucy Powell (right) also use zero-hours . Chancellor George Osborne made similar comments last night, saying: \u2018Of course it would be very difficult \u2026 There are some zero-hour contracts that people want.\u2019 Christian May of the Institute of Directors said Labour\u2019s plans \u2018go too far\u2019. Matthew Irvine, associate at the law firm Thomas Eggar, said: \u2018To many this will seem an eye-catching and attractive policy with Miliband championing workers rights over capitalist employers who are putting profit above workers\u2019 welfare. The risk, however, is that this proposal goes too far and would endanger the continued economic recovery. \u2018In reality, employers may well choose to dismiss workers before they reach 12 weeks or be reluctant to offer work in the first place. 'Miliband\u2019s proposal would potentially undermine job creation, jeopardise zero-hours workers\u2019 current jobs and increase their insecurity.\u2019 Yesterday, opening up yet another front in his war on business, Ed Miliband pledged a Labour Government would \u2018end the exploitation of zero-hours contracts\u2019. Here. JAMES SLACK sorts the Labour leader\u2019s emotive claims about the contracts from the very different reality. CLAIM: We have an epidemic of zero-hours contracts in our country. REALITY: According to the Office for National Statistics, between October and December last year a total of 697,000 people said they were employed on zero-hours contracts in their main job. This represents only 2.3 per cent of people in employment \u2013 or one in every 43 workers. This hardly constitutes an epidemic. CLAIM: There has been a 20 per cent increase in the last year alone. REALITY: It is true the number of people reporting they were on a zero-hours contract rose by 110,000 in the year to December 2014, but the ONS says the two sets of figures are not comparable. In some cases, they will have been on the contracts for years but only just become aware of the fact\u2026 because Miliband had spent so much time talking about them. Labour was warned by statisticians not to use the figures \u2013 but carried on regardless. CLAIM: Zero-hours contracts \u2018undermine hard work, undermining living standards, undermining family life.\u2019 REALITY: Far from inflicting untold misery on the majority of workers, by making it impossible for them to make ends meet, 66 per cent said they did not want to work more hours. Only one in ten on zero-hours contracts said they would like a different job. The average number of hours worked was 22.6 per week. Almost one in five were in full-time education, which would make it hard for them to work any more hours even if they wished to. CLAIM: The Tories won\u2019t end the exploitation of zero-hours contracts. We will. REALITY: Last June the Conservative-led Government took action to ban so-called exclusivity deals which prevented people on zero-hours contracts from working elsewhere. Labour\u2019s record, by contrast, is nothing to boast about: Tony Blair promised in 1995 to ban them after it emerged they were used in UK fast food chains but his Government failed to act in three terms in power. CLAIM: If it\u2019s not good enough for us, it\u2019s not good enough for you. One rule for all. REALITY: Mr Miliband said he could not survive on one of the contracts \u2013 but plenty employed by Labour councils and officials have to do so. Some 68 Labour MPs are reported to have employed staff on the contracts over the last two years, including Ed Balls, Mr Miliband\u2019s parliamentary bag carrier Karen Buck and his election chief Lucy Powell. Meanwhile, Freedom of Information requests show Labour-run town halls are responsible for 21,798 of the contracts \u2013 including 300 in Doncaster, where the Labour leader is seeking re-election as the local MP. CLAIM: The Conservatives believe by looking after a few big firms and individuals at the top, everyone else will be OK. REALITY: It\u2019s by no means only big business that appreciates the flexibility the contracts can provide. A survey of employers by the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development found that a third of voluntary sector organisations used zero-hours contracts, along with a quarter of public sector employers. The figure for private firms \u2013 once again the target for an attack by Mr Miliband \u2013 was only 17 per cent. PS: Even the ever-meddling EU does not object to zero-hours contracts. Despite intense lobbying by Labour MEPs and the party\u2019s trade union paymasters, Brussels has opted to stay out of the row. It insists only that workers should not work more hours than permitted by the Working Time Directive and should be entitled to any holiday rights they have accrued.\n"]}
{"question_id": 808, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: TESTOSTERONE . by Joe Herbert . (OUP \u00a316.99) Testosterone doesn\u2019t always get a good press. Everything that\u2019s unpleasant about male behaviour has been ascribed to the effects of this much maligned hormone. Violence? It\u2019s all testosterone\u2019s fault. Sexual assault and rape? Just blame testosterone. Yet, as Joe Herbert makes clear in his engaging whistlestop tour of the science surrounding it, testosterone is at the heart of human life. \u2018Without our father\u2019s testosterone,\u2019 as he writes, \u2018none of us would exist.\u2019 It has only one basic function \u2014 to enable a male to reproduce, and for that it\u2019s essential. Although this is the case and it\u2019s impossible to think of \u2018maleness\u2019 without testosterone, it\u2019s also important for sexual behaviour in women. The blood of an adult woman before menopause actually contains about five times more testosterone than oestrogen, the supposedly \u2018female\u2019 hormone. However, it\u2019s as a metaphor for masculinity that testosterone is best known. All that\u2019s unpleasant about male behaviour is ascribed to testosterone, yet as Joe Herbert explains, testosterone is at the heart of human life . It begins its influence in the womb as it helps to shape the distinctive characteristics of the male body. This influence continues immediately after birth. That three-month-old baby boy, sweetly smiling at you from his pram, may well have testosterone levels that rival his father\u2019s. We don\u2019t know why but, starting two weeks after birth and lasting for four to six months, a little boy\u2019s testes are producing testosterone in substantial amounts. The hormone\u2019s power then recedes, but returns \u2014 and how! \u2014 in puberty. Post-puberty, testosterone drives the competition for females. In the animal world, stags lock antlers, elephants enter the aggressive state known as musth and male rhinos go horn-to-horn. Even male giraffes, aroused by the hormone\u2019s influence, flail at one another with their long necks. Elaborate colourings emerge in some species, designed to emphasise masculinity and attract female attention. In guenon monkeys the scrotum turns bright blue. They don\u2019t seem to mind. They adopt the habit of sitting with their legs apart to show the female guenons just how big and blue they are. We can only be thankful that testosterone\u2019s effects on sexual display in humans are not so visually dramatic. Adult human males have varying levels of the hormone in different circumstances. Entirely unsurprisingly, having sex increases testosterone levels. So, too, does talking to an attractive woman and watching pornographic movies. Winning at sports sends the levels racing upwards. Just supporting a winning team can have the same effect. It works in politics as well. A study showed that, during the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, Barack Obama supporters were pumped full of testosterone. Levels fell in the supporters of his defeated rival, John McCain. Testosterone also helps in the City. Another study, on a London trading floor, showed that male traders made more money on days on which their morning testosterone levels were higher than usual. A challenge is obviously stimulating. Surgeons facing difficult procedures often find their testosterone levels shooting up. One would assume that the theatre of war would have the same effect as the operating theatre, if not more so. After all, testosterone is supposed to be the hormone behind violence and aggression. In fact, soldiers in the heat of battle can have testosterone levels not much above those of men who have been castrated. It\u2019s the appalling stress that reduces it. Once they leave the front line, however, the soldiers revert to more normal levels. When levels are high, the effects of testosterone on male behaviour are so strong that the human brain has had to find a multitude of ways of regulating and channelling them. The creation of laws, religion and customs has, to some extent, been shaped by the need to do so. In that sense, as Joe Herbert writes, \u2018testosterone lies at the heart of much of our history\u2019. His own fascination with the \u2018simple but wondrous chemical\u2019 that is his subject is clear. His book does a fine job of conveying that fascination to the rest of us.\n"]}

Presumably a victory that strengthens City\u2019s position among the Champions League places, on a weekend when Manchester United lost, eases the pressure on Manuel Pellegrini. But there is sure to remain a fair amount of frustration in Abu Dhabi that the last few months have proved so problematic. By the end of this encounter the greater, more pressing, concern was for the welfare of Silva. Injured from what both managers agreed was an accidental elbow in the face from Cheikhou Kouyate midway through the second half, the Spanish international required oxygen before leaving the pitch on a stretcher after eight minutes of treatment. He was then taken to hospital. But other problems nevertheless remain for City\u2019s manager Pellegrini when he had to wake to headlines being generated by the notoriously vocal agent of Toure, who reportedly accused the Chilean of being \u2018a weak manager\u2019 as well as criticising other prominent members of the club hierarchy, too. Pellegrini was asked to respond but declined to comment. With managers such as Jurgen Klopp now available for hire, these stories are poorly timed for Pellegrini. But he can at least take comfort in the way his team responded to that crushing defeat at Old Trafford the previous weekend. \u2018After two defeats in a row it was a very important win,\u2019 added Pellegrini.

With another match here at home coming next, against Aston Villa, City\u2019s manager is sure to be encouraged by the form of Aguero. Until Sunday he had failed to score a Premier League goal from open play at the Etihad since November 2. But the goal he scored in this contest was neatly taken; much more like the striker City\u2019s subdued supporters have grown to admire. He thrived on the possession City were enjoying \u2014 75 per cent for the first 15 minutes \u2014 and joined Silva and Alek-sandar Kolarov in threatening West Ham\u2019s goal early on. City\u2019s opening goal, scored after 18 minutes, was an absolute horror for West Ham. First came Aaron Cresswell\u2019s failure to win an aerial contest with the diminutive Navas, and then a spectacular own goal from James Collins.

In trying to intercept a cross from Navas, the West Ham centre half succeeded only in scoring with a sliced volley, the ball spinning off his boot and over the head of Adrian before flying home via the underside of the crossbar. If it was a little unfortunate for the visitors it remained a product of the pressure City were exerting. A West Ham side probably unsettled by the uncertainty surrounding their own manager offered little in return. Carlton Cole almost seized on a mistake from Martin Demichelis only for Joe Hart to block his shot, while City\u2019s goalkeeper then marked his 28th birthday by denying Enner Valencia.

The control nevertheless remained with City, a second goal arriving in the 36th minute after Toure had regained possession from Stewart Downing. A rapidly executed counter-attack followed, with Aguero and Navas combining impressively before Aguero slotted home his 101st Manchester City goal. In the dug-out Sam Allardyce appeared thoroughly hacked off, and understandably so given the ineptitude of his defenders and his side\u2019s lack of ambition going forward. He responded at the start of the second half by pushing Valencia into a more attacking role alongside Cole. But it was City who continued to press, with Adrian doing well to deny Aguero a second. The injury to Silva \u2014 earning Kouyate a yellow card despite the fact that it really didn\u2019t look intentional \u2014 disrupted City\u2019s rhythm and gave West Ham a little encouragement. Downing went close, as did Valencia. But to no avail. For once Pellegrini had reason to feel a touch more secure.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a particle accelerator and the largest machine in the world, is ready for action following a two-year shutdown. After problems that delayed the restart in March, scientists at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) completed final tests, enabling the first beams to start circulating Sunday inside the LHC's 17 mile (27 km) ring. \"Operating accelerators for the benefit of the physics community is what CERN's here for,\" CERN Director-General Rolf Heuer said on the organization's website. \"Today, CERN's heart beats once more to the rhythm of the LHC.\" The LHC generates up to 600 million particles per second, with a beam circulating for 10 hours, traveling more than 6 billion miles (more than 10 billion kilometers) -- the distance from Earth to Neptune and back again. At near light-speed, a proton in the LHC makes 11,245 circuits per second. It took thousands of scientists, engineers and technicians decades to devise and build the particle accelerator, housed in a tunnel between Lake Geneva and the Jura mountain range. The purpose of the lengthy project is to recreate the conditions that existed moments after the \"Big Bang\" -- the scientific theory said to explain the creation of the universe. By replicating the energy density and temperature, scientists hope to uncover how the universe evolved. Our current, limited, knowledge is based on what's called The Standard Model of particle physics.  \"But we know that this model is not complete,\" Dr. Mike Lamont, operations group leader at the LHC, told CNN in March. The burning questions that remain include the origin of mass and why some particles are very heavy, while others have no mass at all; a unified description of all the fundamental forces such as gravity; and uncovering dark matter and dark energy, since visible matter accounts for only 4 percent of the universe. The LHC could also question the idea that the universe is only made of matter, despite the theory that antimatter must have been produced in the same amounts at the time of the Big Bang. CERN says the energies achievable by the LHC have only ever been found in nature. The machine alone costs approximately three billion euros (about $3.3 billion), paid for by member countries of CERN and contributions by non-member nations. The organization also asserts that its guidelines for the protection of the environment and personnel comply with standards set by Swiss and French laws and a European Council Directive. Scientists and physics enthusiasts will be waiting with bated breath as the LHC ventures into the great unknown. \"After two years of effort, the LHC is in great shape,\" said CERN Director for Accelerators and Technology, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9rick Bordry. \"But the most important step is still to come when we increase the energy of the beams to new record levels.\" Peter Shadbolt contributed to this report.\n"]}

Los Angeles judge Richard Fruin Jr. awarded Shelly Sterling most of the nearly $3million she had sought. Lawyers for Sterling had claimed that money used to buy V. Stiviano a house, luxury cars and stocks was her community property the couple had acquired over six decades of marriage. Stiviano's lawyer had argued that the gifts were made when Donald and Shelly were separated and that Shelly Sterling couldn't seek them from a third party. Scroll down for video . Shelly Sterling has been awarded nearly all of the $3 million she had sought to be returned from V. Stiviano, who had argued that the gifts were made when Donald Sterling was separated from his wife . Tuesday's ruling comes nearly a year after Stiviano's recording of Donald Sterling making racially offensive remarks bounced him from the NBA and cost him team ownership. Shelly Sterling's lawyers used other recordings to show he bought Stiviano a house, a Ferrari and other things. In the recordings on Stiviano's iPhone, she and the 80-year-old billionaire are heard discussing how to shield gifts from his wife. 'The truth is that everything that I have, you've given me from your heart without me begging or asking or throwing myself all over you,' Stiviano said in snippet played in court. During the course of their 2 1/2 years together, Sterling gave her a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex. Sterling testified that he paid for the entire house, though Stiviano said she had contributed an unknown amount of money given to her in small bills by family members that she saved in a bedroom drawer. During the course of their 2 1/2 years together, Donald Sterling had given Stiviano a Ferrari, a Bentley and a Range Rover, and paid the lion's share of a $1.8 million duplex . Donald Sterling said Stiviano hadn't contributed '50 cents' to the house and, noting that Stiviano is part black and Hispanic, said she illegally got her name inserted into escrow documents by befriending Hispanic bank and escrow employees. Shelly Sterling filed the suit against Stiviano about a month before the recording of Donald Sterling telling Stiviano not to associate with black people created an uproar and led the NBA to ban him for life and fine him $2.5 million. In closing arguments, late last month, Shelly Sterling's lawyer had relied on the words of Miss Stiviano to show that the elderly billionaire was her sugar daddy. Testimony in Los Angeles Superior Court wasn't as clear-cut even after Sterling's lawyers went to great lengths to show that checks Donald Sterling drew from his real estate business ended up in accounts that financed most of Stiviano's $1.8 million Spanish-style duplex near Beverly Hills. While an accountant for Sterling conservatively estimated that Stiviano got more than $3.6 million in Sterling gifts that included a Ferrari and Paris shopping spree, O'Donnell said he would only seek return of the house and more than $1 million in cash, saying the lower figure lined up with Stiviano's own admissions on the witness stand, depositions and court filings. V. Stiviano, 32, pictured arriving at Los Angeles Superior court last month, painted two conflicting portraits of Donald Sterling, saying he was a kind, generous mentor and father figure to her but also a 'bigot' who was mean to others . Judge Richard Fruin Jr had noted earlier that there was no clear documentation that funds went from the Sterling family's real estate company to Stiviano's bank accounts. Defense lawyer Mac Nehoray reiterated that point in his closing argument. He attacked the credibility of witnesses, particularly Donald Sterling, who had suggested Stiviano got her name on the home title illegally. It was Stiviano who recorded the now-infamous conversation with Donald Sterling in which he berated her for associating with black people and urged her not to bring minorities with her to Clippers basketball games. In the furor sparked when the remarks were made public, the NBA banned Sterling from the league for life, and he was ultimately forced to sell the Clippers franchise he had owned for 33 years for a record $2 billion. Nehoray spent most of his argument trying to convince the judge that the law doesn't allow Shelly Sterling to go after a third party like Stiviano because of a breach of fiduciary duty by her husband. 'Say he gave $2,000 to a call girl,' Nehoray said. 'Mrs. Sterling can't go and try to get that money back. We know that's not how it works.' In her testimony, Stiviano testified that the 80-year-old billionaire real estate mogul spent far more time with her and members of her family during the two and a half years she spent as his personal assistant, driver and confidante than he did with his own wife and children. 'We were so interconnected on a level that was more spiritual. He became my everything and I became his all,' she said, though she repeated under oath that the relationship was never sexual in nature. Shelly Sterling, who accused Stiviano of fraud when she testified, painted her rival as a gold digger who seduced her husband into lavishing her with money and gifts and was now out to hurt him. Wife speaks:\u00a0Shelly Sterling, estranged wife of former Los Angeles Clippers basketball team owner Donald Sterling, and her attorney Pierce O'Donnell arrive at Los Angeles Superior Court last month. Mrs Sterling\u00a0painted Stiviano as a gold digger who seduced her husband into giving her cash and gifts . Stiviano, seen here outside the court during last month's trial, testified that tolerating Sterling's racist moments was 'part of the job' Platonic relationship: The 32-year-old repeatedly stated under oath that her relationship with the Clippers owner nearly five decades her senior was spiritual in nature . Stiviano never not disputed Donald Sterling's largesse, though she quibbled with the sums at stake and emphatically denied that she used sex to manipulate him. She repeatedly testified that Sterling tried to manipulate her. The apparent contradictions finally led Shelly Sterling's lawyer, Pierce O'Donnell, to confront Stiviano with the question: 'Who is the real Donald Sterling?' 'The real Donald Sterling is a con artist, a bigot ... he's mean, he's despicable,' Stiviano replied, before quickly adding that to her, he was 'kind, loving, sweet ... a mentor, a father. ... He treated me as he treated no one else.' She added that tolerating his racist moments was 'part of the job' that had its rewards in the way he treated her and her family. Stiviano broke down in tears as she described the Clippers owner showing up at the hospital when her brother needed a heart transplant and described how he appeared in court to support her adoption of two boys. In her testimony, Miss Stiviano claimed that she was not the only recipient of cash gifts from her octogenarian benefactor, and she named a male friend of Sterling's who accompanied them on trips to Dubai, Paris and Thailand. Shelly Sterling said outside court that the assertion was crazy, and she described the man as a longtime family friend who despises Stiviano. The judge allowed the testimony as Stiviano's lawyer tried to show where large, unexplained checks may have gone from Sterling's real estate company that his wife claims were used to pay for a $1.8million duplex, luxury cars, jewelry and shopping sprees for the woman Shelly Sterling asserts was his mistress. Stiviano said she saw cashier's checks given to the man for $800,000 for a 'so-called business deal' involving a property in Los Angeles and a check for $75,000 to reimburse him for the Dubai travel. Stiviano couldn't say if any of that money ended up in accounts identified as sources for the home purchase. She has denied that those were her bank accounts, and Sterling's lawyers couldn't make that connection. The 32-year-old witness said she had worked for Sterling's charity and spent about 12 hours a day with him over more than two years, driving him to view real estate or attending Clippers meetings and games together. She said he provided money, but it was not regular income \u2014 and that became a problem in late 2013 when she wanted a job. 'As long as you're with me side by side, I will take care of everything you need,' she said he assured her. But Stiviano became suspicious when he wanted her to sign a confidentiality agreement. She said she was offended and refused twice to sign any such paperwork. 'I know how he works his trickery,' she said. 'I knew something wasn't right.'\n"]}

Doctors are putting the health of women and their babies at risk by performing caesarean sections too readily, UN officials warn. They say the procedure should only be carried out when \u2018medically necessary\u2019 because it can lead to infections and even death. Just over a quarter of women giving birth in England now have a caesarean and the rate has more than doubled since the early 1990s. This includes a growing number of women opting to have planned caesareans because they are very anxious about giving birth naturally. But last night experts from the World Health Organisation, the UN\u2019s public health agency, said this figure should ideally be between just 10 per cent and 15 per cent, due to the dangers and costs involved. In a statement, they said: \u2018Although it can save lives, caesarean section is often performed without medical need, putting women and their babies at risk of short- and long-term health problems.\u2019 They added that the procedure can lead to \u2018significant complications, disability or death\u2019 and diverts precious money away from the needs of other patients. A planned caesarean costs the NHS an average of \u00a32,369, compared to a natural birth at \u00a31,665. The WHO statement sharply contradicts current NHS guidelines, which say the procedure should be offered to women even when there is no medical justification. The watchdog NICE issued revised recommendations in 2011 allowing women to have the operation if they were very anxious about childbirth, a condition known as tokophobia. Just over a quarter of women giving birth in England now have a caesarean and the rate has more than doubled since the early 1990s . Women are also advised to have planned caesareans if they have had a previous complicated birth, are over 40 or have a medical condition such as asthma, diabetes or depression. But the WHO said that doctors were carrying them out too often, and underestimating the risks. Previous research has found that as many as one in ten caesareans cause infections.\n"]}

Colby was born with a condition known as haemangioma, a  tumour, swelling or growth of the cells that line blood vessels - the\u00a0endothelial cells. These growths are usually benign but can cause severe pain and can bleed or weep easily if disturbed. Ms Ramos-Francis, from Corsham, Wiltshire, who endured a 46-hour labour, said she noticed something different straight after the birth. She said: 'He had a small, pink birthmark on the side of his eye and it was in the same shape as a love-heart. 'I wasn't really that concerned about it because a lot of children are born with them. 'After we got home and we'd settled in with Colby we went for a six-week check up. 'By that time his birthmark had ballooned and it was really bulbous and it wasn't really a nice sight. 'It should have shrunk by the age of one but it hadn't made any progress.' She said doctors in Britain used a range of topical medications and pills - including propranolol - to try and reduce the swelling, but to no avail. The toddler's parents say they were also been the victims of abuse and slurs over their son's appearance, and feared for his chances of living a 'normal' life . His mother added: 'In England they seemed to be picking random numbers hoping it would make a difference, hoping it would shrink it, but it didn't make a difference. 'They then offered steroids but I didn't think it would be right giving a baby steroids, I was against it. 'We didn't really have much of an option except the wait-and-see approach, which we knew deep down really wasn't the best thing for Colby. 'The lady we were seeing eventually said we could possibly see a plastic surgeon - but that it would take years for him to be seen. 'It was a shock we would have to wait that long for surgery. It was heartbreaking.' On top of medical worries, Colby was banned from several daycare centres because of the risk of his growth weeping, leaving his mother unable to seek work while she studies English at the Open University.

Dr Romo said: 'Treating children with facial birth deformities is the most gratifying surgery I can perform. The NHS trust treating Colby before his surgery said that haemangiomas are not routinely surgically removed in the UK . 'The Little Baby Face Foundation transforms not only the face of a child, but their entire life.' The family's claims they would have had to wait many years for plastic surgery have been denied by by Deborah Lee, deputy chief executive of University Hospital Bristol, where Colby received treatment. She said: 'The Trust does not recognise the parents' recollection of the information they were given. 'General advice for this condition in that UK practice is to treat conservatively in the initial stages in the hope that surgery would not be necessary, but even if a decision to proceed to surgery was reached, this would still be during the childhood years. 'Haemangiomas are not routinely surgically removed in the UK. The standard treatment for the condition is propranolol, to which most haemangiomas respond well. 'In the event they do not, patients would be referred to a dermatologist. Any patient accepted for treatment is managed in accordance with national waiting-time standards, which aim to treat 90 per cent of patients within 18 weeks. 'We hope Colby's procedure in the USA was successful, and we wish him the very best for the future.' Colby will now be monitored remotely from New York with the family sending photographs back to the hospital every week.

The property in the Richmond area is said to have been crawling with rats, black widow spiders, dog feces and 300 bottles of urine. The remains which were removed from the house on Saturday are believed to be that of Anna Ragin who lived with her  65-year-old daughter Carolyn. Police removed the body, believed to be that of Anna Ragin, from the property in the Richmond area of San Francisco. Authorities said the home was covered in debris, including dog feces and bottles of urine . Neighbors told The San Francisco Chronicle the mother had not been seen for years. According to records another man, Archibald Ragin, lived at the property but died 15 years ago at the age of 101. Carolyn, said to be a retired Pacific Bell worker, was taken to hospital after her mother's body was removed from the house. Supervisor Eric Mar, a representative in charge of the area, told the Chronicle\u00a0: 'The police captains I've spoken with tell me this is the worst case of hoarding they have ever seen.' He was concerned for the health and safety of the residents, but questioned how the situation in the property could have gotten to such a point. Mr Mar said: 'We certainly want seniors to stay in their communities as long as possible, but when people aren\u2019t getting adequate health care and attention, this is what happens.

Two years ago, Miss Sturgeon said of the independence vote: \u2018We have always said it\u2019s a once in a generation thing.\u2019 But last night, in an election debate on Scottish TV, she said she respected last year\u2019s result, and said she would not call for another plebiscite in the SNP manifesto for the Westminster election in May.

She said she wanted to wanted to do a deal with Mr Miliband so she can influence the policies of a Labour government and keep it \u2018honest\u2019.

Debate: From left to right, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson, First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie . Plan: Speaking in the debate for STV, Ms Sturgeon (right) said wanted Scots to vote SNP rather than Labour because 'we can make sure Labour keeps its promises'. Left, Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy . Grant Shapps, Conservative Party chairman said: \u2018Tonight Nicola Sturgeon has promised that she\u2019d prop up a minority Labour government \u2013 and hold Great Britain to ransom, vote by vote, policy by policy. \u2018And that means more debt, higher taxes and the end of Trident \u2013 wreaking havoc on our economy and putting the security of British people and their families at risk. \u2018Weak Ed Miliband doesn\u2019t stand a chance. He\u2019s in the pocket of Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon: and you\u2019ll pay the price.\u2019 The SNP is way ahead in the polls north of the border, and Labour is expected to lose dozens of seats in May\u2019s election. The result is set to put Miss Sturgeon in a powerful position at Westminster, with the chance of choosing which party can form a government. She said she would never prop up a David Cameron government, but would help Mr Miliband get into Downing Street. But she said the polls showed that Labour could not beat the Tories on their own. Speaking in the debate for STV, Miss Sturgeon said wanted Scots to vote SNP rather than Labour because \u2018if there\u2019s a strong block of SNP MPs, we can make sure Labour keeps its promises. \u2018Tony Blair was elected on a wave of hope and optimism, but his Labour government began the process of NHS privatisation. \u2018I don\u2019t want to see a Labour government simply implement Tory policies.

Above, Ms Sturgeon, second from right, during the debate tonight . \u2018We need to send a strong team to make sure Labour get it; so we can keep Labour honest.\u2019 She said: \u2018We will work with Labour to keep David Cameron out of Downing Street. Labour is not offering an alternative to Tory austerity. \u2018I stood on a platform last week in the UK leaders debate with Ed Miliband and I heard Miliband say if Labour is elected and left to their own devices there will be further spending reductions. \u2018I don\u2019t want to see further spending reductions, I don\u2019t think the country can afford them. That\u2019s why we\u2019re proposing modest spending increases and with SNP influence we can force Labour down that path.' The Scottish first minister has already said offered to work with Labour to keep the Tories out of power if this is possible in a hung parliament. \u2018I\u2019ve said to Ed Miliband and I\u2019ll say to Jim Murphy this evening, that if there is an anti-Tory majority in the House of Commons after the election, even if the Tories are the biggest party we will work with Labour to keep David Cameron out of Downing Street.\u2019 Asked by Mr Murphy where she \u2018wanted\u2019 Mr Miliband to be prime minister, she said: \u2018I\u2019 don\u2019t want David Cameron to be prime minister; I\u2019m offering to help make Ed Miliband prime minister.\u2019 Mr Murphy replied: \u2018Nicola, we don\u2019t need your help. \u2018What we need is people north and south of the border, people in Scotland, people in England and people in across Wales coming together to kick out an out of touch government.\u2019 He claimed he believe Labour would win, saying: \u2018Even when my football team plays Barcelona, I don\u2019t expect us to lose. \u2018David Cameron ain\u2019t no Lionel Messi \u2013 he can be beaten. \u2018Any seat that Labour loses in Scotland reduces the chances of Ed Miliband becoming prime minister.\u2019 Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson said the SNP\u2019s position \u2013 urging Scots to vote against Labour and also promising to prop up a Labour government \u2013 was illogical. \u2018Vote for what you want,\u2019 she said.

{"question_id": 818, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)You may know Mindy Kaling from Fox's cult hit comedy \"The Mindy Project,\" in which she plays Mindy Lahiri, a perky, quirky OB/GYN juggling her career and love life in New York. (Only in the Big Apple can a doctor not afford an apartment!) The show was a breakthrough for on-screen representation \u2014 the first network sitcom created by and starring a woman of color \u2014 and it looks likely to be renewed for the coming 2015-16 season. Recently, however, Kaling's brother Vijay Chokalingam unveiled a project of his own, and while it has been getting a lot of attention, it hasn't generated quite as many laughs \u2014 either from observers or from his famous sibling, who told him it brought \"shame upon their family.\" You see, Chokalingam revealed that, as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago, he engaged in a daring (his view) or ridiculous and offensive (pretty much everyone else) scam: He applied to medical school claiming to be African-American. Chokalingam had spent his college years as a \"hard-partying frat boy,\" and achieved a less than stunning 3.1 GPA. Upon facing graduation and exploring his med school options, he realized that fellow Indian-Americans with his grades were getting turned down from the universities of his choice \u2014 but that \"black, Hispanic, and Native American applicants with my grades and test scores were much more likely to gain acceptance.\" This revelation led him to make the decision to pose as a black man, both to \"dramatically improve\" his chances of admission, and to illustrate the unfair advantage that blacks and other underrepresented minorities receive when applying to prestigious schools. To accomplish this goal, Chokalingam shaved his head of its naturally wavy black locks, trimmed his \"long Indian-American eyelashes,\" checked \"black\" under the optional race/ethnicity declaration and submitted his application to 14 schools under his childhood nickname \"JoJo.\" He received invitations for in-person interviews at 11 schools, results that he claims support the notion that African-Americans garner special privileges that are unavailable to whites or Asians. And now that the statute of limitations on his act of fraud has expired, he's looking to write a book on his experiences, titled \"Almost Black: The True Story of an Indian American Who Got Into Medical School Pretending to Be an African American.\" What's truly curious is that even if you agree with Chokalingam that affirmative action is merely a form of \"systematic racism,\" when all is said and done, it offers very little evidence of the \"privilege\" that he claims is accorded to black, Hispanic and Native American candidates. Chokalingam had mediocre grades and MCATs, but he graduated from one of the most prestigious schools in the nation. Yet even while representing himself as black, Chokalingam received only a single admission offer, to St. Louis University's School of Medicine, which falls somewhere between 57th and 67th in national rankings. Harvard, University of Pennsylvania, Columbia and all the higher ranked schools he applied to rejected him. Meanwhile, he admits, pretending to be black came with disadvantages. He found himself being accused of shoplifting by store clerks and harassed by cops \u2014 who would regularly stop him while driving and demand that he tell them how much his car cost, implying that he must have stolen it. These acts of very real prejudice, experienced regularly by blacks and Hispanics of all backgrounds \u2014 multimillionaire comedian Chris Rock has recently been tweeting pictures of the occasions when he is pulled over by police for no reason \u2014 didn't seem to dissuade Chokalingam from his adamant belief in the unfairness of a system that seeks to address the shockingly low numbers of minority health practitioners by providing some weight to race and ethnicity in decision-making. It's not just a matter of what individual applicants \"deserve.\" One-third of Americans are black, Hispanic or Native American; just one in 10 physicians are. Since minority medical practitioners are up to three times as likely to practice in their own communities, this lack of diversity has produced \"doctor deserts,\" in which urban and rural ethnic enclaves across the nation go without access to primary care physicians. Years ago, when I told my father \u2014 a doctor from a long line of doctors \u2014 that I didn't want to follow in his footsteps, he told me that was fine, because medicine is a service trade, and anyone not interested in serving should avoid the profession. A medical degree isn't a reward to be earned, he said, but a responsibility to be accepted. Which really cuts to the heart of what's so sad about Chokalingam's racial farce. Like others who've recently been exposed for falsely claiming racial identities \u2014 including putative presidential candidate Jeb Bush, who registered himself as \"Hispanic\" on a 2009 voter form, and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who was excoriated during her campaign for having claimed Native American ancestry in the past \u2014 Chokalingam wanted to claim the fruits of racial affiliation without having to carry black people's burden. Race isn't just about color or blood; it is about the collective experiences and inherited cultural context and present-day condition of a community of people. Many of the markers of race are persistently corrosive; others are deeply painful. Affirmative action programs are a means of redress for these awful realities of our nation's history; an imperfect one, but necessary. There are some fields where the imbalances might never correct themselves on their own. Industries like health care and Hollywood. Because what's most ironic about Chokalingam's decision to ride on his sister's coattails in telling his story: While Asians are well represented in medicine, our numbers are vanishingly low in the entertainment and media world, and until the recent breakthrough of modern pioneers like Mindy Kaling, it was impossible to imagine film and television that included our faces, voices and stories. Kaling's immense talent and charisma made her a star. But it was a quota-based affirmative action initiative -- NBC's Diversity Writers Program -- that gave her a start.\n"]}

I think that's becoming less and less true and indeed the two top rank female politicians sitting alongside me today are two of the main reasons for that. 'But we need to work harder and there still are occasions where people in the party, men in the party, who should know better, have occasionally resorted to boorishness or chauvinism.

Ms James said the party would tackle the problem of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she warned is 'accepted cultural practice' for some of 'our ethnic compatriots'. Mrs Evans, who is writing the party's election manifesto, blamed the gap in support for Ukip between men and women on 'lies' and 'myths' spread about the party.

The Hornets went into the game knowing a win would take them back into the automatic promotion places following Middlesbrough's victory at Norwich on Friday. They looked as though they would have to settle for second after Matt Ritchie put Bournemouth ahead against Sheffield Wednesday and on course for top spot, but Chris Maguire's stoppage-time penalty at the Goldsands Stadium denied the Cherries and left Watford on top of the pile. Craig Cathcart fired Watford into the lead with a stunning strike in the 56th minute . Birmingham goalkeeper\u00a0Darren Randolph. is powerless to stop Cathcart's sublime effort . The decisive goal at Vicarage Road came in the 56th minute when substitute Ikechi Anya crossed from the left and Cathcart sent a fine volleyed finish into the top corner past goalkeeper Darren Randolph. Despite looking good in possession going forward, it took the Hornets almost 20 minutes to begin to open up the Birmingham defence. They were unfortunate not to take the lead, though, when a fine pass from Adlene Guedioura created the opportunity for Troy Deeney who was denied by a good save with his legs by Randolph. The ball then broke for Matej Vydra, whose follow-up was deflected up and onto the crossbar. Vydra and Guedioura threatened before the home side went close again when the ball was played into Almen Abdi and he spun superbly away from his man to shift the ball onto his left foot before curling a shot narrowly wide of the far post. Cathcart races away to celebrate his decisive goal for the Hornets . Watford continued to press for the breakthrough in the remainder of the first half but they were unable to seriously threaten again before the interval. But it was a double change from manager Slavisa Jokanovic in the 54th minute that was to prove the catalyst for his side taking the lead as he brought on Anya and Odion Ighalo for Miguel Layun and Vydra. Within two minutes, Anya had been released down the left by Deeney and the Scotland international's first-time cross into the near post was met by a superb effort over his right shoulder by Cathcart.

Angella had another chance and on this occasion he did nothing wrong, meeting an Abdi corner with a downward header only to see it cleared off the goal-line.

Charles Kingham, 86, and partner Pauline Moore, 68, have been together for 40 years and bought their home in the quiet Lincolnshire seaside resort of Mablethorpe for \u00a335,000 in 1987. They spent two years converting it into their dream home, but it became a 'living hell' after it was converted into an integrated offender management centre, which deals with persistent criminals. Scroll down for video . Board stiff: The couple have been forced to board up every window in their home for protection . The pair have both suffered health problems as a result of the stress the ordeal has put them under. Mr Kingham, who served in the Merchant Navy and ran his own timber company before retiring, said: 'The biggest fear for me is going to bed and wondering if we are going to wake up if something is thrown through the letter box. 'We sit here sometimes and think how we have had such a wonderful life. 'But this is misery, absolute misery and nobody wants to do anything. That is the modern world.' Ms Moore claimed the problems started when people started selling drugs nearby and would walk up their garden path 'high'. Incidents intensified when the couple reported anti-social behaviour in the area. They were targeted on an almost weekly basis, with vandals smashing windows with stones and pelting their home with eggs and golf balls. The thugs even splashed cooking fat across the walls and path, urinated on their flowers and keyed their car. At least they have each other: The couple have been together for 40 years despite 'misery' caused by thugs . Every single window of their home has been smashed and the couple eventually got so sick of having to spend time and money replacing them that they took drastic measures. The pair spent \u00a3700 on wood and boarded up the house for protection. They have been living in the shadows ever since. And although the house should be worth \u00a3100,000, the couple believe they would have to sell for a knock-down price of \u00a360,000 to escape the darkness. Retired office worker Ms Moore sobbed: 'This house was a dream home but our life has been made a living hell. 'We can't sell and are just stuck here so we've barricaded ourselves in. It's the only thing we could think of doing to stop the abuse. 'We have both got so low. I have developed a heart condition through anxiety. 'When they were banging on the windows, Charles went down with a chest infection because of the stress. I thought he was going to die. Dark days: Mr Kingham has to perform normal daily tasks in constant gloom since boarding up his home . 'The trouble started four years ago when the old lady who lived next door died and the house was turned into an integrated offender management centre. 'It was basically for offenders coming out of prison. We didn't have a problem with that at first but suddenly people in the area started selling drugs and coming up our garden path high and even urinating on it. 'We reported it to the police and ever since then we have been plagued with problems. 'The police have been down and seen the damage caused. We've had a pan of chip fat put on the wall of the house\u00a0and we had our little red Ford Fiesta completely keyed down both sides. Keen reader Mr Kingham (left) has been forced to read in a dark room since they boarded up the windows (right) 'In November there was a big party nearby and at 3am people were banging on our windows and shouting. 'We've had eggs and golf balls thrown at our bungalow and three of our windows are still chipped. 'We didn't report every incident to the police because we thought we'd just sell up and we hoped it would all stop but it has just got worse. 'We decided enough was enough and got the windows boarded up because it's the only thing we could think of to do to protect ourselves. 'We have boarded up the two windows in the lounge, the two in the bedroom and the kitchen. The only ones that aren't boarded are the dining room and bathroom. 'It is quite dark inside and not nice sitting in total darkness when the weather is lovely but it was the only alternative and we do feel safer. Better days: The couple enjoying life on a holiday to the USA in the 1990s before the problems started . 'We could sell our bungalow which is not what we want to do. 'By law you have to declare anti-social behaviour so even though it is worth \u00a3100,000 we would probably only be able to sell it for \u00a360,000.' Mr Kingham added:\u00a0'We are compiling a full report of incidents against our home but I fear it won't make much difference. Boarding the windows seemed the most common sense thing to do.' Lincolnshire Police and East Lindsey District Council confirmed they were aware of the attacks on the couple's home. Jon Challen, community safety team leader at East Lindsey District Council, said: 'Both the council and police take all reports of antisocial behaviour very seriously. 'Both agencies are working closely together on this matter but at this time there is no evidence that any offence has been committed.' A spokesperson for Lincolnshire Police added: 'The local neighbourhood policing team are aware of the couple and the allegations of anti-social behaviour. 'Lincolnshire Police take all reports of ASB seriously and, together with partners at other agencies, have robust systems in place to assist those affected and identify the most vulnerable. 'To date in this case, no offences have been identified but police and ASB officers from East Lindsey District Council continue to offer support to Ms Moore and will investigate each reported allegation.'\n"]}

Torpedo supporters showed the flag during the club's 3-1 win over Arsenal Tula on Sunday. The punishment will not take effect until May because Torpedo are already required to play their next two home games behind closed doors for a separate incident in which fans abused Zenit St Petersburg striker Hulk with monkey chants. Sunday's clash between Torpedo Moscow and Arsenal Tula was marred by violence and racism . A fan lays on the ground after being attacked by rival supporters during Torpedo's latest away game . Sunday's game was also marred by crowd violence, with Torpedo fans attacking Arsenal supporters and police. For that, Torpedo fans will be barred from the club's next three away games, with the exception of women and children under 13. Torpedo was fined a total of 900,000 rubles (\u00a311,000) for various offenses including the Nazi banner, the fighting, use of pyrotechnics by fans, and insulting chants. Arsenal received a 480,000-ruble (\u00a36,000) fine on charges including failing to secure the stadium properly. Police detained 15 fans at the game, of which seven face charges, Russian agency Tass reported on Monday. In response to the incidents at Sunday's game, Torpedo president Alexander Tukmanov told the R-Sport agency that the club's fans seemed to be 'probably the most aggressive' of any top-flight Russian team. Torpedo's previous three racism offenses this season all involved monkey chants against opposition players. Torpedo are already due to play their next two home games behind closed doors after aiming monkey chants at Zenit St Petersburg during their fixture last month . Club were also punished after fans abused Dynamo Moscow defender Christopher Samba earlier in season . The latest punishment comes a week after the Russian Football Union appointed its first dedicated anti-racism inspector, who is tasked with gathering evidence to punish clubs for racism-related incidents at matches. A report by two anti-discrimination organizations last month said there were more than 200 cases of discriminatory behavior linked to Russian soccer over two seasons, as the country prepares to host the 2018 World Cup. Separately on Tuesday, Zenit coach Andre Villas-Boas was given a suspended one-game ban by the Russian Football Union for repeatedly breaking rules on leaving his technical area at games throughout the season.\n"]}

The Ukip leader was expected at a farm in Staffordshire, as he prepared to attack the government over defence spending, but organisers pulled the plug while he was trapped in his chauffeur-driven car. Mr Farage faced ridicule last year when he blamed immigrants clogging up the M4 after he missed an event charging supporters \u00a325-a-head to meet him. Nigel Farage's campaigning got off to a faltering start today as he missed a Ukip event after getting stuck in traffic. He did manage to make an appearance at an event in Carrick (pictured) Mr Farage is under pressure to show his election campaign is on track after polls showed a slump in support in Ukip and suggested he might struggle to win his own seat in South Thanet. He had hoped to use a return to the campaign trail after the bank holiday weekend to highlight Ukip's call to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence. But he missed the farm visit in Staffordshire after suffering travel delays, according to a party spokesman. In December the Ukip leader was branded 'silly and dangerous' after claiming high levels of immigration caused problems on the roads. He claimed he arrived too late for a \u00a325-a-head drinks reception in Port Talbot because the UK's 'open door immigration' policy meant that the M4 'is not as navigable as it used to be'. He insisted the no-show was 'nothing to do with professionalism' amid claims Ukip was struggling to cope with increased scrutiny and demands on his time. 'In all these years in Ukip that's probably about the third event out of a thousand that I haven't made in time,' he said in December. Mr Farage had hoped to use a return to the campaign trail after the bank holiday weekend to highlight Ukip's call to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic product on defence . Meanwhile Mr Farage now is battling to fend off an alarming slump in the polls for Ukip - with support falling by a quarter in less than six months. The Ukip leader has seen support for his party drop from 16.75 per cent in November to just 12.25 per cent today, with voters appearing to switch to the Tories in the run up to the election. Mr Farage is also facing a fight to win his own election battle after falling behind the Tories in Thanet South, Kent - despite enjoying a 12 point lead over his Conservative rival just two months ago. He will visit the West Midlands later where he is expected to condemn rising aid budgets under David Cameron and will accuse both Labour and the Conservatives of abandoning the military covenant. Speaking ahead of a visit to the West Midlands, Mr Farage had said: 'I am really looking forward to coming again to the West Midlands. It is the heartland of England.' He is due to give a speech at the Copthorne Hotel in Brierley Hill in the Black Country this evening.

In a direct attack on the Prime Minister, the Ukip leader will add: 'No previous Conservative prime minister in history would have countenanced sanctioning continual rises in foreign aid giveaways while at the same time pursuing a programme of continual cuts in defence.' A Conservative Party spokesman said Mr Farage was 'playing politics with the military in a calculated and completely irresponsible way'. He added: 'We've balanced the defence budget after inheriting a truly enormous black hole from Labour. We have the second largest defence budget in Nato after the United States and will spend over \u00a3160 billion in the next decade on new military equipment. 'It comes down to this: you can only have strong armed forces if you have a strong economy first. That's exactly what this Government is delivering.

Google confirmed to\u00a0Yahoo Finance\u00a0in a statement that its current policy changed - meaning the company will store the balances for users of the mobile transfer service (similar to PayPal and Venmo) in multiple federally-insured banking institutions. This is good news for people who place large amounts of money in their Wallet Balance because the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures funds for banking institutions up to $250,000. Currently, Google's user agreement says funds are not protected by the FDIC. However, a Google spokesperson told Yahoo Finance that the current policy has changed. The policy states that 'funds held by Google Payment Corp. or its service providers (including any bank service providers) in connection with the processing of Payment Transactions are not deposit obligations of Buyer, and\u00a0are not insured for the benefit of Buyer by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency', according to\u00a09to5. As a non-banking institution, Google Wallet, along with PayPal and Venmo, is not legally required to be federally insured. But with the new change to its policy, funds in Wallet Balance are protected if anything were to happen to the company like bankruptcy. For example, for those who use mobile payment services where funds are not FDIC insured, if a company files for bankruptcy, the user would become their creditor and would be required to go through bankruptcy court to get their money back. But for users with FDIC insurance, they would receive their money from the government in a matter of days, according to Yahoo Finance. Details on when Google Wallet's user agreement will be updated were not provided. How Google Wallet works: . Google Wallet, launched in 2011, stores credit and debit card information, and lets shoppers pay for goods by tapping their phones against special terminals at store checkout counters. It works with any debit or credit card, on every mobile carrier. The service allows users to send money to anyone in the US with a Gmail address, or request money on-the-go, directly from their bank account, debit card or Wallet Balance. Users can spend received money through the service in stores or withdraw cash from ATMs with the Google Wallet Card, as well as transfer the funds directly to their bank account. It comes with 24/7 fraud monitoring, and users can disable their Wallet app or card from their Google Wallet account if they're ever lost or stolen. Source: Google Wallet . Earlier this month, a federal judge rejected Google Inc's request to dismiss a lawsuit accusing the technology company of invading the privacy of users of its Google Wallet electronic payment service by sharing their personal information with outside app developers. The judge said Google must face claims it breached users' contracts, violated the federal Stored Communications Act which limits disclosure of electronic records, and violated a California consumer protection law. Judge Beth Labson Freeman in San Jose, California said Google Wallet users may try to show that Google 'frustrated' the purpose of its own privacy policy by allowing 'blanket, universal disclosure' of their personal information to app developers whenever they bought apps in Google's Play Store. The lead plaintiff is Alice Svenson, an Illinois resident who said Google sent unnecessary personal information about her to YCDroid when she paid that developer $1.77 for an email app. She said Google raised the risk of identity theft by routinely sending information about Google Wallet users such as addresses and zip codes, phone numbers and email addresses to app developers. Svenson said the Mountain View, California-based company ceased the practice soon after the lawsuit was filed in September 2013. Her lawsuit seeks class-action status, damages of $1,000 per violation, punitive damages and other remedies.\n"]}

But federal prosecutors charging Mohamud with supporting terrorism and making false statements say he was actually being instructed to carry out a terrorist act in the United States. Scroll down for video . Abdirahman Sheik Mohamud, 23, faces charges for attempting to provide and providing material support to terrorists, attempting to provide and providing material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization, and making false statements to the FBI . He pleaded not guilty to the charges Friday in a Columbus . federal court. Mohamud, 23, a naturalized American, had . been instructed by a Muslim cleric to return to the United . States and carry out an act of terrorism, a federal indictment . said. It said Mohamud had told an associate that he wanted to go . to a military base in Texas and 'kill three or four American . soldiers execution-style.' Before traveling from the United States to Syria, Mohamud . had posted material on social media promoting symbols of the . Islamic State militant group, the indictment said. However, a law enforcement official told Reuters that once . in Syria Mohamud and his brother, Aden, trained with the Nusra . Front, the local affiliate of al Qaeda. In Syria he sent videos of himself to an unnamed person, the . indictment said. In one video, he pointed to a gun in a holster . on his hip ,and in another he stood in front of a white house . with a black flag on it. Mohamud's brother, Abdifatah Aden, was killed fighting with the Nusra Front, . according to the indictment. NBC reports that a 17-year-old cousin of Mohamud's in the United Kingdom said that Mohamud's older brother had arrived in Syria 'to help out the oppressed Muslims there.' However neither brother showed any signs of hating their adopted country. '(Mohamud) loved Americans,\" he said. 'He was one of them.' Yet another brother, Abdiqani Aden, has also been arrested and after being accused of making a threatening gesture at a guard while visiting his brother in prison. Such accusations are completely foreign to friend Mohamed Elrayah, who had gotten the 'I'm chilling' years after the two lost touch. 'He did normal things \u2014 basketball, go to the park, go to the movies on Fridays,' Elrayah told NBC News. 'Everyone loved being around him. He was a nice person.' Elrayah, three years Mohamud's senior at school, did not recall the accused terrorist-in-training as a particularly religious man when they first met. However in 2011, he says he say his friend growing a long beard. 'I asked him about it and he said, 'Well, I'm kind of religious now,'' Elrayah told reporters, adding that he did not see the new religious interest a sign of being radicalized. In fact, he said he was astonished to hear of the charges. 'I would like to ask him, 'What happened?' I just keep thinking, 'What happened to this kid?'' Elrayah told reporters. Mohamud's friends expressed shock the man they knew as a normal, likable student would want to harm the country they believed he'd embraced as him home . Upon his return to the United States, authorities said, Mohamud told . an unidentified person that while in Syria, he had been trained . in shooting weapons, breaking into houses, using explosives and . engaging in hand-to-hand combat. According to the indictment, Mohamud 'wanted to kill . Americans, and specifically wanted to target armed forces, . police officers or any uniformed individuals.'

{"question_id": 832, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: With the coffee drinking scene continuing to grow in Britain, baristas and cafe owners are putting more thought into the cakes and pasties that accompany your beverage. And while coffee matching rules are not as hard and fast as wine pairing ones, there are still some things you should consider. So the next time you order a latte and reach for a slice of cake, you might want to want to rethink your choice of dessert and have a Chelsea bun instead. The next time you order your coffee give some thought to your choice of pastry . The classic English pastry has been identified as the perfect accompaniment to a creamy latte, as well as a cinnamon swirl and a pain au raisin. And espressos are best paired with chocolate truffles or a mini raspberry coulis. Flat whites are best accompanied by a blueberry muffin, and a plain black coffee is best drunk with a glazed ring doughnut. Will Corby, from online coffee subscription company Pact Coffee, told FEMAIL: \u2018It is worth remembering that the coffee used to brew different types of coffee will all have different flavour profiles so the acidity/bitterness/sweetness balance of the coffee used is something to consider when pairing it with pudding. From lattes to espresso and Americano to cafe au lait, here are Will's picks for the best puddings and pastries to accompany your cup of java. A latte (left) which has a light espresso flavour is best complemented with a Chelsea bun (right) LATTE: Cinnamon swirl, Chelsea bun or pain au raisin . Something big and hearty has to go with the light texture and sweetness of a latte. Delicate spice and toasted pastry flavours should work best, allowing you to detect the light espresso flavour through the warm milk. ESPRESSO: Chocolate truffle or mini raspberry couli . Espresso is strong and short drink, your taste buds will be exposed to very intense tastes when you drink it and any accompaniment needs to either pack an equally intense punch or complement in an alternative and cleansing way. I would suggest the chocolate truffle be paired with a fruity espresso and the raspberry couli with a more chocolatey espresso. FLAT WHITE: Muffins . A light fluffy muffin (blueberry is my choice of sweet) should accompany your flat white really well but if you are prepared to take things a little further a ham and cheese sweet/savoury muffin works even better! IRISH COFFEE: Cheese and crackers . Definitely an end of meal, post-dessert drink this is best paired with cheese - perhaps a crumbly hard cheese like a Lancashire - \u00a0and sweet crackers but maybe avoid the chutney. Glazed ring doughnuts (left) will bring out the flavour profile of a plain black coffee (right) CAPPUCCINO: Amaretti . Amaretti for dipping, avoid any extra milk or other intense flavours when it comes to this drink. BLACK COFFEE: Doughnuts . Black coffee (brewed filter or with a V60 dripper) with tends to have a more delicate flavour profile than coffee brewed in other ways. Drink it with a glazed ring doughnut to make the most of the coffee flavours. AMERICANO: Baked New York cheesecake . A cheesecake and an Americano should sit together really nicely... you will generally end up with a much more developed bitterness in an Americano and the heavy fat and intense sweetness from this cheesecake should balance that perfectly. MOCHA: Marshmallows . Opt for good quality squidgy vanilla marshmallows as this drink already has all the flavour going on. It just needs the addition of a little extra sweetness and texture from the desert. Good quality marshmallows (left) will complement the strong flavours of a mocha (right) CAFE AU LAIT: Croissant . A French classic, this should really be accompanied by croissant and blackcurrant jam. CORTADO: Custard tart . An espresso cut with a small amount of milk, this coffee is Spanish or Portuguese in origin, so I would lean towards a Portuguese (custard) tart for this. MACCHIATO: Almond brittle . To go with this espresso topped with foamy milk, choose almond brittle, which has short, intense caramelised sweetness but tastes more like toffee than sugar. AFFOGATO: Best by itself . This coffee is the dessert, in which an espresso is poured over ice cream so it should require no addition! A post-dessert drink, Irish coffee (left) is best paired with a crumbly, hard cheese such as  Lancashire (right) Latte: Coffee made with espresso and steamed milk. Espresso: Strong coffee made by forcing steam through ground coffee beans. Flat white: An Australian invention this is prepared by pouring microfoam (steamed milk with fine bubbles) over a single or double espresso. Irish coffee: Coffee made with Irish whisky and sugar, and topped with cream. Cappucino - Smaller in volume than a latte, a cappucino has hot milk and steamed milk foam with one shot of expresso. Affogato: Vanilla ice-cream topped with a hot shot of espresso. Americano: Espresso diluted with hot water. Mocha: A chocolate flavoured latte with espresso and hot milk. Cafe au lait: A light brown coffee with milk. Macchiato: Espresso with a small amount of steamed, foamed milk. Cortado: A Spanish version of the macchiato made with espresso and a small amount of steamed milk.\n"]}

An eerie serenity pervades the rolling landscape of this peninsula and, in the bright spring sunshine, there could scarcely be a more peaceful spot for a Sunday afternoon stroll. But a chill is never far from the spine, whatever the temperature. Scroll down for video . Sulva Bay, Gallipoli Peninsula, Turkey, where in the World War I there were nearly 400,00 Allied casualties . In the early hours of today, 25 April 2015, a bugle sounded a haunting dawn chorus to mark the moment when, at 0430, Allied troops landed at a point where Asia meets Europe, Anzac Cove, to commence the disastrous Dardanelles Campaign. Thousands of visitors from the UK, Australia, New Zealand, India and France have gathered to honour the fallen at one of the biggest commemorations of the Great War. Today this beautiful Turkish isthmus, facing the Aegean to the west, the Dardanelles Straits and the Sea of Marmara to the east, is a patchwork of monuments and memorial stones linked by country lanes, mountain tracks and undulating greenery. Allied soldiers land and begin the attack at Gallipoli, sometimes known as the Dardanelles Campaign . People have been gathering the graves at Beach Cemetery at Gallipoli to mark the campaigns's centenary . Allied cemeteries at Gallipoli are kept immaculately by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission . A cross left by a visitor at a graveside in Gallipoli bearing a personal thanks to the one of the soldiers killed . On a visit ahead of the poignant anniversary, we wandered among Anzac\u2019s sea-facing white headstones before heading down to the tip of the peninsula. Here stands one of the most magnificent of the cemeteries, the Helles Memorial to the British. Troops are remembered in row upon row of immaculate Commonwealth war graves and huge expanses of dazzling white marble, etched with the names of the fallen, which circle the cemetery. Accompanied by a feral dog and her puppies, we strolled down the dirt track to V Beach cemetery where the sea laps below the walls and where two Irish battalions were laid to rest. The mighty ruined fortress of Sedd\u00fclbahir, brought to its knees by Allied naval firepower in 1915, overlooks the cemetery. The ruins of the fortress at Sedd\u00fclbahir in Gallipoli - its name in Turkish means 'barrier to the sea' Seaside homes dot the flat sands and yellow sandstone bluffs rise out of the Aegean. In the valleys between the cliffs, olive and tamaris trees grow down the steep escarpments. We stopped for a stiff coffee at a modest coffee house on the square, opposite the mosque at Sedd al Bahr, and watched the fishermen\u2019s tiny rowing boats bobbing in the slack waters of Cape Helles. A far cry from the fateful morning of April 25 1915, when one of the bloodiest and most ill-conceived campaigns of the First World War kicked off, a campaign which almost brought to an end the career of its main instigator, Winston Churchill, and which witnessed almost 400,000 casualties. The Allied plan was as brilliantly simple in conception as it was hopeless in execution: secure the Straits and take Constantinople, giving access to the Black Sea to supply the Russians in order to free up a new line of attack on the Germans. It would also pull in the Greeks and Bulgarians, ancient enemies of the Ottoman Turks, and hey presto, the stalemate of the Western Front would be suddenly transformed into a glorious victory from the East. Churchill, who was First Lord of the Admiralty, had underestimated the strength of the Turkish troops, under the command of modern Turkey\u2019s founding father, Kemal Atat\u00fcrk, and had overestimated the potency of his own superannuated fleet, which fell easy prey to the mines and coastal gun batteries. Churchill (left) had been a soldier, but in 1916 underestimated the Turkish \u00a0forces led by Atat\u00fcrk (right) If the naval thrust was a failure, his attempt to consolidate on land was a calamity, and after nine months of blistering summer heat and frostbitten winter nights the ragbag army of dysentery-ridden men was evacuated the following December and January, and Churchill was forced to resign his post. The easiest way to access the peninsula is from the port of Canakkale, which is a quick ferry ride across the narrowest section of the Straits. The Gallipoli War Museum (Canakkale Destani Tanitim Merkezi), is well hidden from view but well worth finding. This 5,600 square metre visitor centre, on the road to Kabatepe, was commissioned by the army and the Ministry of Defence and was only recently finished. It is an architectural triumph that does justice to its subject. The Gallipoli War Museum has many relics from the campaign from both the Allies and Turkish sides . In addition to 11 rooms, with cinema screens shockingly simulating what it was like in the trenches of Gallipoli. There are also some rather more prosaic offerings which carry poignant memento mori: bullets with bullet holes in them as well as Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s waistcoat and dress shoes. There are also letters, watches, mangled boots and water canteens that would be inadequate for a summer school trip to Longleat safari park. Items of clothing worn in battle by\u00a0Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk who commanded the Turkish forces at Gallipoli . The battle sites and 31 memorials to the 130,000 dead covers a surprisingly small area. This is because Allied troops were unable to make much headway against the ferocious onslaught of Atat\u00fcrk\u2019s men. Heat, exhaustion, illness and difficult terrain also dogged every step. With an impressive flourish of national pride, the Turkish government has declared the whole area a Historic Park, to show the futility of war. Up at Chunuk Bair, where the Allies enjoyed a shortlived victory, the trenches have been preserved. You can look down on Suvla Bay 540m below, where British troops landed, and walk a few hundred metres along the preserved dug-outs in the footsteps of New Zealand\u2019s Wellington Battalion, before visiting the New Zealand monument. Here, a statue to Atat\u00fcrk, the Allies\u2019 nemesis, celebrates the moment when a fob watch covering his heart prevented a bullet from possibly changing the course of modern history. From the Australian monument at Lone Pine there are views across the peninsula, from the Aegean to the Dardanelles. Nearby is Kili\u00e7bayiri, the memorial to the Turkish 57th Infantry Regiment, which was wiped out following the Allied landings at Anzac. Atat\u00fcrk, the 19th Division commander, famously told his men: \"I am not ordering you to attack. I am ordering you to die. During the time before we die other forces and commanders will take our place.\" The great man, of course, lived to tell the tale. Before taking the 10-minute ferry back across the Straits to Canakkale we walked through the French Memorial at Morto Bay. Lined by rosemary bushes, baytrees and well-ordered flowerbeds, this is perhaps the biggest and most atmospheric of them all, with 3,236 graves and four ossuaries containing the bones of 12,000 unidentifiable soldiers. It surprises many to learn that more French soldiers were killed at Gallipoli than Australians and New Zealanders combined. Mark Porter was a guest of the Turkish Culture and Tourism Office.

While the 100th anniversary itself is going to be a tad too busy for most, the museum and Historic Park are open to all 365-days a year. For those unable to make the celebrations on the day, there is always a fallback position: Russell Crowe\u2019s film about it, The Water Diviner, is out now .\n"]}

Ms Berry was put through to a call centre in South Africa when she phoned the company over the issue last month. She says she made small talk with the man who answered the query to fill 'dead air', but did nothing to suggest she was interested in him. The 21-year-old was stunned when she later received a string of messages from the man, who said his name is 'Miguel'. In one text, the man referred to himself as her 'future hubby' and promised to buy her shoes when he met her. He also sent her a picture of himself in one message, and told her: 'Wow I knew you beautiful but damn you are super beautiful.' After asking how 'his in-laws' were, he said: 'I'm hope I'm not being too, how can I say, forward.' The man repeatedly sent Ms Berry messages featuring photos of himself and kissing emoticons . The man has sent her 18 messages since she made the call, some of which have referred to his family in Liverpool, making Ms Berry fear he may try to approach her. She told the\u00a0Manchester Evening News: 'It is quite scary, it is quite distressing. He won't leave me alone. Being pestered by someone I don't know gets me quite nervous.' The man has now been suspended by Vodafone, which says it has a number of call centres in the UK but also sends some callers through to their office in South Africa.

Four members of the Royals and three from the White Sox were punished for their roles in a series-opening brawl and six of the players drew suspensions. Major League Baseball placed the blame for the fighting squarely on both teams. Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura was handed a seven-game suspension, fellow starter Edinson Volquez given five games and outfielder Lorenzo Cain and reliever Kelvin Herrera got two games apiece. White Sox pitchers Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija were suspended five games each, while catcher Tyler Flowers escaped suspension but joined the others in getting an undisclosed fine. Mass brawl: Chicago White Sox's Jeff Samardzija (center) in the brawl with Kansas City Royals players during the seventh inning of Thursday's game. Smardzija and five others have been suspended as a result . All-in: Each player   ran onto the field for the brawl where there was pushing, shoving and a few punches . Several punches were thrown and Kansas City's Ventura, Lorenzo Cain and Edinson Volquez were ejected along with Chicago's Chris Sale and Jeff Samardzija (pictured going down) The Royals have not said whether they plan to appeal their punishments, which would begin with Sunday's series finale because of a rainout Saturday. Sale and Samardzija plan to appeal. 'I think everybody had some elements of their behavior over the course of that incident on both sides that they wish they handled differently,' White Sox general manager Rick Hahn said during a conference call Saturday. 'Respect the fact that our players stood up and took responsibility for their actions and expressed remorse over those things they wish had been handled better. 'It is something that happens from time to time,' Hahn added. 'It's part of the game.' It's a costly part of the game, though. Along with the suspensions, Hahn said reliever Matt Albers fractured a finger on his throwing hand in the melee and will go on the disabled list. Meanwhile, Herrera is already awaiting an appeal on a five-game suspension that was handed down after he threw a pitch behind Oakland third baseman Brett Lawrie during a series last weekend. Ventura was fined for hitting Lawrie with a 99 mph fastball during the same series. 'We understand that Major League Baseball has to do what they think is fair in situations like this,' Royals manager Ned Yost said in a team statement. 'Now, we just have to wait for the appeals process to play out.' Suspended:\u00a0Royals pitcher Yordano Ventura (left) was handed a seven-game suspension, fellow starter Edinson Volquez (right) given five games . Punished: Both\u00a0outfielder Lorenzo Cain (left) and reliever Kelvin Herrera (right) were suspended for two games . White Sox:\u00a0White Sox pitchers Chris Sale (left) and Jeff Samardzija (right) were suspended five games each . Tensions between the Royals and White Sox had been building since the opening series of the season, when the teams combined to hit six batters. Two more were plunked early Thursday night when Ventura hit Jose Abreu in the fourth inning and Sale hit Mike Moustakas in the fifth. The simmering anger finally boiled over in the seventh, when Ventura snagged a grounder from Chicago outfielder Adam Eaton and the two exchanged words before Eaton was thrown out at first. Eaton had to be restrained from Ventura, who was ejected from his second straight start. 'It was a messy situation,' Ventura said through a translator. Players from both dugouts and bullpens then ran onto the field. Volquez whiffed throwing a haymaker, and several other players threw punches in a fight that lasted several minutes. 'There are real negative repercussions of this,' Hahn said.' After he was thrown from the game, Sale went to the Royals clubhouse and was seen pounding on the door. While nothing more transpired, Hahn said he spoke to his star pitcher about it Friday. 'It was a private conversation,' Hahn said. 'We certainly understand where Chris was coming from in terms of the emotion involved in the moment and what he was hoping to accomplish, and at the same time realizing that perhaps there was a better way to handle these things going forward.' Five players ultimately were ejected from Thursday night's game, which the Royals won in 13 innings. Among them was Cain, who has been hit by pitches four times this season. Moustakas and teammate Alex Gordon have been hit an AL-leading five times apiece, and the Royals have been hit 17 times as a team - tied with Texas for the league lead entering the day. Umpires ejected a total of five players from both teams after the fight after the seventh inning of Thursday's game at Chicago's U.S. Cellular Field, Illinois . 'This game's emotional and it seems to follow them around,' said White Sox manager Robin Ventura, who famously charged the mound and was pummeled by the Rangers' Nolan Ryan during a game in 1993. 'Everybody gets emotional and reacts to things and that's what happened.' The Royals are starting to earn a fighting reputation. Along with their two series with the White Sox and a tense three-game set in Oakland, Ventura got into a heated argument with Angels slugger Mike Trout during a series in Los Angeles. While acknowledging that the Royals must do a better job of containing their emotions, Yost insisted that his club has rarely been the instigator in a string of testy situations. 'Hopefully it's all behind us,' he said Thursday night, 'and we can move forward.' The teams played eight innings Friday night without incident, but the rest of the game was postponed due to rain with the score 2-2. It was supposed to resume Saturday, but more rain in Chicago means that it will now resume Sunday with the Royals batting in the top of the ninth. John Danks is scheduled to start for the White Sox in the second game Sunday, while fellow left-hander Jason Vargas is expected to go for the Royals. No makeup date was announced for Saturday's game.\n"]}

ISIS fighters can be seen\u00a0hammering and drilling away at sculptures and stone slabs believed to be some 3,000 years old in the ruins of the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud, located near the Islamic State-controlled city of Mosul. The seven-minute expertly edited video, purportedly shows Islamic State destroying the relics before bulldozing and blowing up the ruins, completely obliterating the historic site. The destruction at Nimrud, which took place last month, follows other attacks on cultural heritage sites carried out by the Islamic State, which now holds a third of Iraq and neighboring Syria in its self-declared caliphate. Scroll down for video . Attack: An ISIS militant uses a sledgehammer to destroy a several thousand years old stone slab in a video allegedly showing the group's attack on the ancient ruins of the city of Nimrud, near Mosul, Iraq . As well as attacking the city by hand, hammer and drill, the video shows the group making barrel bombs which they lined up along the ancient relics inside the ruins of what was once the capital of the Assyrian Empire, founded some time in\u00a0the 13th century B.C. ISIS released the video, believed to have been filmed last month, showing militants smashing artifacts in the historic city, which is on UNESCO's tentative list of world heritage sites, before blowing it up . The attack on the ancient site horrified archaeologists when it was first reported last month, and has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. The seven-minute video, posted late Saturday, shows bearded militants using sledgehammers, jackhammers and saws to take down huge alabaster reliefs depicting Assyrian kings and deities. A bulldozer brings down walls, while militants fill barrels with explosives and later destroy three separate areas of the site in massive explosions. 'God has honored us in the Islamic State to remove all of these idols and statutes worshipped instead of Allah in the past days,' one militant says in the video. Another militant vows that 'whenever we seize a piece of land, we will remove signs of idolatry and spread monotheism.' Attack: The video, made available by a Jihadist media outlet, shows ISIS militants destroying a stoneslab with a sledgehammer at what they say is the ancient Assyrian city of Nimrud in northern Iraq . Horrified: The attack on the ancient site has been declared a 'war crime' by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon . Islamic State militants have been destroying ancient relics on several sites, daying they promote idolatry that violate their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law . It is believed parts of the footage may be from a nearby site as some of the figures in the Nimrud video appears to have rebar, ribbed steel bars designed to reinforce concrete that are a technique of modern building. However, an Iraqi Antiquities Ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said all the items at Nimrud were authentic. When the destruction was first reported several weeks ago a Mosul tribal leader confirmed that SIIS had 'looted the valuables in Nimrud and then proceeded to level the site to the ground. There used to be statues and walls as well as a castle that Islamic State has destroyed completely.' 'In a new crime in their series of reckless offenses they assaulted the ancient city of Nimrud and bulldozed it with heavy machinery, appropriating archaeological attractions dating back 13 centuries BC,' the United Nations cultural agency UNESCO said in a statement last month. UNESCO head Irina Bokova added: 'This is yet another attack against the Iraqi people, reminding us that nothing is safe from the cultural cleansing under way in the country: it targets human lives, minorities, and is marked by the systematic destruction of humanity's ancient heritage,' she said . Complete destruction: The end of the video allegedly shows Islamic State militants blowing up the ancient ruins near Mosul . One of many: This is only the most recent video purporting to show Islamic State fighters destroying invaluable heritage sites . Islamic State militants have been destroying ancient relics on several sites, saying they promote idolatry that violate their fundamentalist interpretation of Islamic law, including the ancient Iraqi city of Hatra, a UNESCO World Heritage site. Authorities also believe they've sold others on the black market to fund their atrocities. This is only the most recent proof of Islamic State fighters destroying invaluable heritage sites. A shocking video emerged last week, showing ISIS militants using sledgehammers and AK-47 rifles to destroy walls and statues in Iraq's UNESCO World Heritage city of Hatra. In the slickly produced seven minute footage, jihadists are shown smashing shrines and statues in the 2,000-year old city. Militants are also recorded chipping away at the bases of some of the larger wall sculptures and cracking boulders into ancient city pillars, while eerie music plays in the background. The video cuts to jihadists speaking directly to the camera with one declaring they destroyed the site because it is 'worshipped instead of God'. Last month, ISIS terrorists were pictured toppling crosses, smashing Christian relics with hammers and erecting the black flag of ISIS on churches in Nineveh, the ancient capital of the Assyrian empire. The Assyrians first rose around 2,500 B.C. and at one point ruled over a realm stretching from the Mediterranean coast to what is present-day Iran. They left dozens of palaces and temples decorated with huge reliefs mainly depicting their kings' military campaigns and conquests, hunting lions and making sacrifices to the gods. Their main hallmark was the colossal winged man-headed lions or bulls, protective deities put at the entrances of palaces and temples weighing about 10-30 tons each, some of which are now at the British Museum. Located on the eastern side of the Tigris River, Nimrud was founded in the 13th century B.C. During the reign of King Ashurnasirpal II, Nimrud served as the second capital for Assyrian Empire. Other Assyrian capitals were Ashur, Dur Sharrukin and Ninevah. Nimrud and some of its kings were mentioned in the Bible, the city mentioned under the name of Calah or Kalhu\u00a0in the Book of Genesis. Excavations at Nimrud were first started by the British traveler and archaeologist Austen Henry Layard from 1845 to 1851, followed by other foreign and local excavation missions. The city is surrounded by a four-side wall measuring 8 kilometers (5 miles) long. Among the ruins are the grand palace of Ashurnasirpal II, as well as the temples of Nabu, the god of writing and the arts, and other temples. Among the most significant discoveries at Nimrud were four tombs of royal women. There, a collection of 613 pieces of gold jewelry and precious stones were unearthed. They survived the looting of the Iraqi National Museum that followed the U.S.-led invasion in 2003 as they were kept in a vault at the Central Bank of Iraq building by Saddam Hussein's government.\n"]}

Former two-weight world champion Haye, 34, was stopped by officials on his arrival at Dubai International Airport and accused of fraud by writing a cheque as payment for a new property which bounced. The boxer, who has not fought since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012, also handed over his passport to authorities, and has been unable to leave the United Arab Emirates - forcing him to miss a mixed martial arts event in Birmingham at the weekend. Former heavyweight boxing champion David Haye was stopped at Dubai International Airport and questioned over allegations that he wrote a \u00a3341,000 cheque which bounced. He is pictured during his trip to Dubai . The cheque, worth 1.8million Emirati Dirham, was intended as a final payment on a newly-built property, as part of a deal with developers Emaar, which is part-owned by the Dubai government. Haye has said the 'bounced' cheque  was down to an administrative error. He told The Sun's Michael Hamilton: 'The cheque was presented to the bank four days before I landed. It was not due to be presented until final completion of my property, which is due in a few weeks. 'This was an administrative error which is being rectified. I explained to the police and presented documents as proof. But I can totally understand these mistakes can happen.' Writing a cheque that later bounces is a crime in Dubai, and can be punishable with jail, a fine, and being ordered to pay the amount. Haye had been due to attend a mixed martial arts event in Birmingham on Saturday but was unable to leave the UAE. Instead he went to a Robbie Williams concert in Abu Dhabi . Police give suspects one month to pay the value of the cheque before taking the case to court. Figures released last June showed that Dubai police dealt with almost 80,000 bounced cheques in 2013-14, worth 9.4billion Dirham, or \u00a31.7bn. According to The Sun, Haye was held at the airport as he arrived for a\u00a0holiday earlier this month after he was flagged up on a wanted list. He was reportedly taken to Bur Dubai police station, which has a department for bounced cheque suspects, and was released the same day. He surrendered his passport, as did two of his associates. The Foreign Office is understood to have had no involvement in the case. Haye has not been seen in the boxing ring since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012. He is pictured after the fight at Upton Park with the WBA and WBO International Heavyweight Championship belts . During his stay in Dubai, Haye has reportedly been staying at the luxurious Palm Jumeirah development, and has been tweeting photographs of himself enjoying the sunshine, as well as meeting fans. He posted a video to his Instagram account today thanking fans for their concern over an 'administrative issue' as he walked along a beach in the sunshine. In the video, which he captioned 'Don't worry about me too much!!!', he said: 'Thanks for all your worry and concern but don't get too stressed about me, things aren't that bad. 'A little administrative issue has left me in Dubai for a few days longer than anticipated but it's getting smoothed out as we speak and I'll be back - probably in London or Las Vegas soon.' Haye had been due to attend a BAMMA mixed martial arts event in Birmingham on Saturday, where he was to present a live broadcast for channel Spike TV, but was forced to cancel due to his extended stay in Dubai. Instead, his place on the commentary team was taken by WBA super-middleweight champion Carl Froch. In an Instagram message which was also posted to the event's Facebook page, Haye said: 'Sorry I can't be there tonight for BAMMA 20, I'm gutted, I'm stuck here in Dubai but I'll be there on June 13 in Birmingham for BAMMA 21.' 'Enjoy the action tonight, it's going to be great.' While he should have been in Birmingham, Haye instead told his 1.05 million Twitter followers that he had been to a Robbie Williams concert in Abu Dhabi, writing: 'Rluctantly came to @robbiewilliams concert Abu Dhabi, as not my style of music. But I'm a fan now, pure old school!' [sic]. Haye has not been seen in the  ring since he defeated Dereck Chisora in July 2012, while two planned fights against\u00a0British rival Tyson Fury have fallen through, the second as a result of shoulder surgery. Despite being advised by doctors to give up boxing, he is said to be planning a comeback and hopes to fight again within the next 18 months.

In a move that will be applauded by many, and is sure to dismay those accustomed to seeing scantily-clad beauties posing next to cars before a race, the FIA-backed series is adopting a more progressive stance. 'From Silverstone next week, you will see that for any race we will do - no grid girls like in the past,' WEC chief executive Gerard Neveu said after a presentation on Thursday for the opening Silverstone six-hour race. The world endurance championship have announced that there will be no more 'grid girls' before races . The decision by the FIA is seen as a progressive one by those in a male-dominated sport . 'For me that is the past. The condition of women is a little bit different now,' he said. The use of models, also referred to as 'race queens' or 'umbrella girls', to stand by cars with flags or placards displaying drivers' numbers has long been a feature of Formula One. It has also been a bone of contention for those seeking more equality and less sexism in a male-dominated sport, although in some series where women racers have joined the grid the 'umbrella' role has been taken by a man. The Hawiian Tropic Girls arrive on the grid before the start of the Le Mans 24 Hour Race in 2001 . Toyota's world champion Anthony Davidson said it was about time things changed. 'I talk about this with my wife quite a lot, and we both agree it's actually pretty backward,' the Briton, who has also raced in Formula One, said. 'It's old school to have such a concept as grid girls. Surely the world's moved on? And motor racing should follow quite closely what the rest of the world's doing in that respect. 'I think that's a really nice touch, a modern touch as well, from the WEC to take that aspect of racing away. It is a bit sexist.' Neveu said the cars would line up diagonally opposite the pit wall and grandstand as if for an old-style 'Le Mans start'. Current\u00a0world champion Anthony Davidson has backed the decision to remove grid girls for equality . In Le Mans of old, before safety concerns stopped the practice, drivers would run across the track to the cars but at Silverstone there will be a rolling start. Neveu said the changes were all part of catering for a new audience. 'The sport is sport, but around it we can do many things,' he said. 'We will have a DJ, entertainment, many things on the grid. The show will start from the grid... but the star at the end is the sportscars and the drivers of the car.'\n"]}

Freak coincidence: His brother had died at the same junction eight months earlier after colliding with a lorry . Mr Zhang, the elder of the two brothers, was taken to hospital for his injuries but died shortly after. The silver car that hit Mr Zhang on his motorbike when he pulled out of the junction sped away from the scene without stopping. A driver who witnessed the accident tried to chase after the car but eventually lost it in traffic.

During the video, the noise made by the phone is responded to with chirps from the ducklings. As the first bird moves towards him the firefighter, also armed with a torch, dived headfirst further into the drain and emerges with the panicked baby duck cupped in his hand. The adorable animal, who is also chirping away in a noise remarkably similar to the ringtone, is then passed to another officer standing above the storm drain. It took Mr Knecht 90 minutes to catch the first four ducklings during the rescue mission in the southeast Louisiana community of Slidell. But two members of the agitated gang needed more time to calm down and were not rescued until an hour later. All six ducklings were reunited with their mother on Saturday at their home on a nearby canal. Bizarrely it was the station's second duck rescue in a week - as on April 19, firefighters rescued a duck that got stuck in a chimney. Chad Duffaut, Chief of Fire Prevention, said: 'Unable to capture the other two baby ducks, the crew went back to the fire station to give the ducks a chance to calm dawn. 'They returned about an hour later and rescued the two remaining baby ducks.'\n"]}

Tyrus Byrd, 40, was sworn into office in Parma last week, but her election victory was overshadowed by the departure of the majority of the police force, the city attorney, clerk and\u00a0water treatment supervisor. The officials all cited 'safety concerns' in their resignation letters, the outgoing mayor says. There are 713 people living in the community and, according to the US Census Bureau, 57percent are white and 41percent are black. Unwelcome change: Tyrus Byrd, who was sworn in as mayor last week, must find replacements for five of the city's six police officers, the city attorney, the city clerk and the water treatment supervisor. Mrs Byrd, who was sworn in last Wednesday, told Daily Mail Online she still doesn't know why the employees quit - though the outgoing mayor says they cited 'safety concerns' in their resignations . Mrs Byrd, who was sworn in on Wednesday, told the Daily Mail Online on Sunday that she is still not sure why the city employees quit. Her father, former city board member Simon Wofford, insists his daughter has a good relationship with the police department. KFVS-TV\u00a0broke the story last week. Citizens rallied to Mrs Bryd's side, saying that the town didn't even need as many officers as it had. 'I think it was pretty dirty the way they all quit without giving her a chance, but I don't think they hurt the town with quitting because who needs six police for 740 people?' resident Martha Miller told KFVS. The run-down city, which is 175 miles south of St. Louis in southeastern Missouri, has suffered a spate of break-ins recently. Despite the surge in crime and the comparatively large police force, residents told the TV station that they almost never saw cops patrolling the streets. Mrs Byrd told Daily Mail Online that the election of the first\u00a0African American mayor should be celebrated instead of focusing on the departures of city employees. Randall Ramsey, the outgoing mayor who has spent 36 years in the job, told the Daily Mail Online he also has no idea why the group quit.

The head teacher of an Indian school has been arrested after he was accused of beating an 11-year-old pupil to death for stealing another's boy's pencil and eraser. Lalit Verma is said to have launched into a furious assault on a boy named only as Shiva after the stolen items were discovered in the boy's bag at\u00a0Dwarika Prasad School in Railamau village. The alleged beating was so severe that the child complained of a severe stomach ache and began vomiting blood once he arrived home. An ambulance was called but by the time Shiva got to nearby Fatehpur Hospital his condition deteriorated and he was declared dead on arrival. Verman has been charged with culpable homicide not amounting to murder and detained for questioning, the Times of India reported. The child's body has now been taken for post-mortem to establish the cause of death, but police told reporters that it is likely he died of internal bleeding. Police superintendent OP Singh said Shiva's father had filed a report with officers in\u00a0Biddupur relating to the 'unnatural' death of his son. Further legal action can only take place once an official verdict on the nature of Shiva's death has been established and recorded.

The Transport Workers' Union's National Secretary Tony Sheldon condemned the requested change to the Fair Work Act and accused Aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom. 'Major retailers like Aldi are trying to turn the clocks back on our modern society to reintroduce serfdom,' Mr Sheldon in a statement. Aldi has requested the ability to make employees work more than 38 hours in a submission to Workplace Relations Productivity Commission . 'Their model is to keep workers employed on vulnerable part-time and casual basis, increasing and reducing their hours when they see fit.' National Secretary of the Transport Workers' Union, Tony Sheldon, \u00a0accused Aldi of trying to reintroduce serfdom . His comment was made amidst a new submission from the supermarket giant to the Workplace Relations Productivity Commission, in which it recommended that the National Employment Standards be amended to 'enable employers and employees greater flexibility to determine reasonable working hours above the standard 38 hour week'. Aldi's last attempt to increase workers hours in 2012 failed despite the supermarket chain arguing that their employees 'overwhelmingly supported' and 'preferred' the proposals. 'ALDI's experience is that employees are keen for the opportunity of guaranteed additional hours and commensurate income, and prefer this arrangement to a limit of 38 hours plus additional hours to be worked as needed,' David Zalunardo, Aldi's managing director, wrote. However Mr Sheldon argued that the employer had been stopped for good reason, saying the chain had tried to 'strip workers of their rights'. 'The Transport Workers' Union and its members acted against this billion-dollar company in 2012, when it tried to strip workers of their right to refuse to work unreasonably long hours,' he said. Mr Sheldon responded by saying: 'Aldi... believes the right of workers to challenge bad workplace agreements is \"not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy\"' 'Aldi then failed the legal and fairness test, but now in a submission to the Productivity Commission it is seeking again to scrap the same safeguards. 'We can only hope that Aldi's dream for the Australian economy never comes true.' The grocery store also protested union's power to interfere in enterprise agreements, arguing that a recent incident, in which a union representing only 'a very small number of employees' delayed an agreement, caused 'negative consequences\u2026in terms of uncertainty, financial costs and distraction from managing the business'. 'Based on our experience, the length of time taken for FWC consideration of enterprise agreements can be unduly prolonged, costly and disruptive to continuing business operations, which is disadvantageous to all stakeholders. This is not acceptable in a modern, flexible economy,' Mr\u00a0Zalunardo wrote.

The first print ad, which shows images of various female American Apparel employees, who are identified by their first names and their start date at the company in small print below their pictures, has the words 'Hello Ladies' emblazoned across the page and appeared in the latest issue of Vice. 'Women have always been in charge at American Apparel,' the ad reads. \u2018In fact, women make up 55per cent of our global workforce (sorry, guys) and an even higher percentage of our leadership and executive roles. This structure is incredibly (and unfortunately) rare in the corporate world.' Major rebranding: Controversial retailer American Apparel debuted a new 'pro-women' ad campaign featuring this image of three female employees from the company . New message: The brand also shared images from the campaign on its Instagram account for International Women's Day . The images featured in the ad were also posted on the company's Instagram account last month in celebration of International Women's Day with more than 16,000 people liking the photo collage. American Apparel confirmed to WWD\u00a0that the ad only has thus far only appeared in Vice, and the outlet noted that it was an interesting choice for the company to make because the magazine 'isn\u2019t exactly known as female friendly'. 'We have had a great relationship with Vice for years and plan on continuing to work closely with them on future campaigns and partnerships,' American Apparel's senior vice president of marketing Cynthia Erland told WWD . Smiling faces: According to the ad, 55per cent of American Apparel's staffers are women . Work appropriate: These female employees\u00a0were photographed wearing modest button-down shirts, which is a far cry from the brand's more sexually explicit ads . But WWD went on to add that it was 'likely not a coincidence' that the ad ran in first issue helmed by Vice's new female editor-in-chief Ellis Jones. Before the Los Angeles-based company's founder and former CEO Dov Charney was ousted in December following a string of sexual harassment lawsuits, the retailer had a history of using boundary-pushing, sexually provocative ads featuring fresh-faced girls to sell its clothing. Now that Dov has since been replaced by Paula Schneider, the images have been significantly toned down as the brand rethinks its previous marketing strategy. New attitude: The company, which has a history of using sexually proactive ads like this one, is rethinking its marketing strategy under the helm of the American Apparel's new CEO\u00a0Paula Schneider . American Apparel has also started airbrushing out pubic hair and nipples from lingerie models in attempt to make the brand 'less pornographic'. But controversy continues to follow the company. The brand came under fire again after a leaked email written on March 18 by casting agent Phira Luon said the company would be hiring real models not 'Instagram Hoes' or 'THOTS', which is an acronym meaning 'That ho over there'. Both American Apparel and Phira publicly apologized for the email, and the brand posted an image of 'curvier models' to its Facebook page as a means of proving the sentiment in the email did not reflect the company\u2019s general ethos, writing: 'This is American Apparel, always has been and always will be. We love all of our models, all shapes and sizes. #welovediversity #weloveyouall! [sic]'\n"]}

Bournemouth were out of it. Then they were in it. Then it all went bonkers and Eddie Howe was caught between feelings of regret and unhappiness with Paul Tierney, the referee. The stripped-down fact is that it finished 2-2. The glorious detail is that Bournemouth trailed to a Kieran Lee sucker punch, levelled through Yann Kermorgant and then had a man sent off. A problem?

Matt Ritchie scored the kind of goal that belongs in the Premier League to put them in front. Job done? Not nearly. Chris Maguire scored a penalty for Wednesday deep into stoppage time and three point became one; a big step towards the top flight became a stumble. Howe was left 'heartbroken', but also frustrated, not least because he felt Callum Wilson deserved a penalty in the second half when he appeared to be fouled by Lewis Buxton. Bournemouth have had 15 penalties this season and Howe suggested that might be counting against them, saying in a radio interview: 'It looked like the referees have come together and talked about Callum Wilson and said don\u2019t give him any penalties because Bournemouth have had too many this season and we don\u2019 t want them to have any more.' His broader disappointment was also clear, having blown a major opportunity to keep top spot in a thrilling division. He said: 'It really is tough to take. That is why we love the game \u2013 the drama and twists and turns. 'The pain and frustration we need to transfer into motivation. This is our most successful season but we have had low moments. We have only two games and our objective is clear. We have to use this as motivation to move forward now. We have to respond.' Lee had put Wednesday in front with a 36th-minute header before Kermorgant levelled midway through the second half. A draw at that stage might have seemed fair but Simon Francis was sent off for two yellow cards and Bournemouth were back on the ropes. Cue bedlam. Ritchie launched a shot into the top corner after Andrew Surman laid off a free-kick but Maguire added to the madness in stoppage time. Wednesday manager Stuart Grey couldn't help but chuckle. He said: 'It took six and a half hours to get down here but we got on with it. If we left without anything it would have been disappointing.'

Justus Howell was gunned down from behind by an officer in Zion, Illinois on Saturday afternoon after officers were called to reports of an argument. The chief of the Zion Police Department has now said that the argument was in fact a scuffle over a handgun - during which the firearm went off and Howell allegedly pointed it at another teenager. Killed: Justus Howell, 17, was shot twice in the back by police in Zion, Illinois, on Saturday afternoon . 'Stole a handgun': Police say that Howell had just taken a weapon from Tramond Peet, 18, who was trying to sell it to him . Steve Dumyahn said Howell was struggling over a gun with Tramond Peet, 18, and started running when police showed up. Peet told officers he met Howell with the intention of selling him the gun - but Howell tried to snatch it without paying. He then claimed the two tussled over the weapon, which was fired into the ground. At one point, he said, Howell was pointing it at him. Peet told investigators that he let go of the gun when he heard sirens. He said Howell ran and that he heard officers shouting instructions, then opening fire. An autopsy on Howell revealed that he was hit by two bullets, both from behind. Aftermath: Investigators are pictured above at the scene of the shooting, which took place around 2pm . One his his left side and penetrated his heart, spleen and liver. The second hit him on the right side of his back. Tests to see whether there were drugs in Howell's body are not finished yet. In the wake of his death, Howell's mother LaToya told Fox News\u00a0her son 'couldn't have been a threat'. She said: 'Justus was a young man murdered by Zion police'. 'As he was fleeing from police, they killed my son. He couldn't have been a threat if he was running.' Peet appeared in court Monday on two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon. He is being held on a $15,000 bond. Dumyahn said the Zion Police Department was releasing the narrative from the shooting because media outlets had linked Peet's case to the shooting. He said the department has 'no desire to defame the deceased'. Courts: Peet appeared in court Monday charged with\u00a0two counts of aggravated unlawful use of a weapon . Claim: Zion Police chief Steve Dumyahn said the department had 'no desire to defame' Howell, but released the details because media outlets realized his case and Peet's are connected . Dumyahn said the officer who shot Howell is a nine-year veteran, and is now on administrative leave. He did not release the officer's name or any additional information about him, including his race. Lake County NAACP president Jennifer Witherspoon said his relatives have asked her organization to speak on their behalf. Witherspoon said authorities told the NAACP that they have videotape of the scuffle between Peet and Howell but can't yet say what led the officer to shoot Howell. She said Howell's relatives are hoping to find out exactly what happened as quickly as possible. She said: 'Whether it was a mistake on his part or a mistake on the police's part, they want answers to make sure something like this never happens again'. Howell's death is the latest in a series of unarmed black men being killed by police officers - the most high-profile example of which was the death of Michael Brown at the hands of Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Missouri. Witherspoon added: 'Here in America we are seeing this with too many brown and black boys.' Zion is a community of about 24,000 people along Lake Michigan, 45 miles north of Chicago, near Illinois' border with Wisconsin. Howell was a high school junior who transferred from a school in Wisconsin to Waukegan Public School District 60.\n"]}

He rejected the most recent offer of \u00a3100,000 a week and has attracted interest from Liverpool's Premier League rivals Manchester City and Chelsea. But Zidane has revealed that the European Champions are also after Sterling, pointing to recent Real captures like Gareth Bale and Raphael Varane as proof of their commitment to snapping up the continent's premier young talent. 'We know who Raheem Sterling is, and of course we are monitoring him as a player,' Zidane said. 'There are very few players in the world who can improve the Real Madrid squad, so it is going to make sense we monitor the progress of the best young players in the world. 'We monitored Bale for over a year, the same with Isco and also Varane. 'We monitor many of the best young players in Europe, then if we feel they have something to offer Real Madrid we will contact their club and try and make the next step.' Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has admitted Liverpool may struggle to attract top players . Real Madrid have the splashed the cash on the likes of Gareth Bale and Raphael Varane in recent years . La Liga giants broke the world transfer record in August 2013 by forking out \u00a386million on Bale . Sterling's boss Brendan Rodgers admitted after his side's dismal 4-1 defeat at Arsenal that Liverpool will have trouble attracting top players without Champions League football. He said: \u2018It makes it difficult, there\u2019s no doubt about that. Most players want to be in the Champions League. They want to play at the top level of the game and if you\u2019re not in the Champions League it makes it difficult for you. We know that. \u2018It\u2019s going to be a little like this until we become more stable. We\u2019ve got young players who are growing, getting more experience and then hopefully there will be a period where we qualify again. We want to be in the Champions League. That\u2019s important and it is key for us. \u2018It\u2019s highly unlikely this year. But Liverpool is a great club. I said that before I came into it. It\u2019s a phenomenal club that players want to play for.\u2019\n"]}

The teaser for \"Amy: The Girl Behind the Name,\" set for UK release on July 3, features early footage of Winehouse talking about how her music career was born and where she believed she was headed. \"Singing has always been important to me, but I never thought, 'I'll end up singing' or 'I'll be a singer,' \" Winehouse said. \"I felt like I had nothing new that was coming out at the time that really represented me or the way I felt, so, you know, I just started writing.\" Winehouse, known for her bluesy voice, bouffant hairdo and numerous tattoos, struggled publicly with drugs and alcohol during a career in which she recorded two albums and won six Grammys (one posthumous). She died from alcohol poisoning at the age of 27 on July 23, 2011. Her biggest hit, \"Rehab,\" chronicled the efforts of those around her to get her to submit to substance abuse treatment. \"Amy\" seeks to \"truly capture not just the great artist that she was, but also the funny and loving person that most people didn't get a chance to know,\" the filmmakers said on Facebook after announcing the film in 2013. Amy Winehouse documentary gets UK release date . The trailer conveys Winehouse's ambivalence about fame. \"I'm not a girl trying to be a star or trying to be anything other than a musician,\" she says. \"I don't think I'm gonna be at all famous,\" Winehouse tells an interviewer early in her career. \"I don't think I could handle it. I would probably go mad. Do you know what I mean? I would go mad.\" A life cut short: Remembering the tragedy of Amy Winehouse . Unlike an earlier look at the singer's life, 2013's \"Fallen Star,\" the documentary has been endorsed by Winehouse's family. It will feature \"extensive unseen archive footage and previously unheard tracks,\" Deadline reported. The team behind the new film includes Asif Kapadia, director of the documentary \"Senna,\" on the life of Brazilian Formula 1 racer Ayrton Senna. The film won two BAFTA awards. \"The award-winning producers of Senna presented a vision that would look at Amy's story sensitively, honestly and without sensationalising her,\" the family statement said. \"We want this to be a tribute to her musical legacy.\"' A U.S. release date for the film has yet to be announced.

Virgil van Dijk's sublime 16th free-kick gave the Parkhead side a dream start to their Scottish Cup semi-final clash with Inverness. But the Parkhead side were denied a clear penalty and the chance to go 2-0 ahead before half-time when additional assistant Alan Muir failed to spot a goalline handball from Josh Meekings. Ronny Deila was angry at the referee's decision to now send off Josh Meekings and award his side a penalty . Celtic's anger was further fuelled when McLean - rightly - sent off Parkhead keeper Craig Gordon for clattering into Marley Watkins in 53 minutes, Greg Tansey equalising from the spot. A man down for 67 minutes the Scottish champions wilted in extra-time, succumbing to goals from Edward Ofore and David Raven, despite John Guidetti making it 2-2. In measured tones, Deila chose his reaction to the penalty furore carefully saying: 'I don't think I have to say much about that. 'I think everybody can see what's happening. The Inverness defender (6) handled Leigh Griffiths goal-bound header but none of the officials saw it . 'When they played with 11 v 11 we had good control of the game and produced good chances and enough to win the game. 'But, of course, with ten it gets more difficult and we have to run more. 'And, again, we got very tired.' Pinning the blame for the incident on the unsighted additional assistant Muir rather than referee MacLean the Norwegian added: 'We have five referees, maybe we need seven \u2013 I don't know. One on each post. The Celtic boss remonstrated with Steven McLean at half-time and was angry at the poor decision . 'He has one task. He has to look at something on the goalline. 'You can't blame the main referee for that.' Asked if it was a big, critical moment in the game he added: 'I don't think. Everybody knows that. 'The game is finished if we get it. 'That's a tough day. Hard to take of course. Inverness' players celebrate at the final whistle after reaching the Scottish Cup final after extra time . 'I think we fought very hard. When you don't get the result you want of course it's a blow for us.' The Meekings incident, the latest in a wretched season for Scottish referees, will reopen the debate surrounding television replays. 'This will not help anything today,' said Deila, dismissing the idea. 'It's very hard for me to discuss this. 'It's a big blow for the boys. I'm very disappointed. 'We had control, eleven v eleven and should have killed the game before. Virgil van Dijk (left) had given Celtic the lead and put his side in control before all the incidents kicked off . 'We didn't do it and put ourselves in very sad situation. 'But Inverness are a good football team. I also have to congratulate them. They have had a good season and if they get a title it will be even better, so that's very good.' Insisting he had no issues over the red card for Gordon which forced him to remove the dangerous James Forrest and put Lukasz Zaluska in goals Deila vowed to lift his shatteted players for Wednesday's trip to Dundee on league business. Currently leading Aberdeen by five points with a game in hand he insisted: 'We have to move on. We still have a lot to fight for. Craig Gordon (left) was rightly sent off by the referee for fouling Marley Watkins when he went through . 'The league title is still the most important thing. We have to get back on track. 'Good teams bounce back quickly. Now on Wednesday we have to be back on track, and that's what we're aiming for. 'Everybody is very disappointed today. But I have had disappointing moments before in football. It's about how you handle it and what you learn from it. We've done a lot of good things so far and if we win the league as well we'll have had a good season. So we have a lot to build on. 'We just have to move on.

Describing her as an 'unbelievably good sport', he added: \u00a0'Harry got a sniff of a rumour on the night and the rumour mill was going into overdrive. 'But, in fact, she did such a good performance that she's been asked to star in the next Bond film. I'm thrilled for her.' Scroll down for video . Birthday: The Queen, pictured at Newbury Racecourse on Saturday, is celebrating her 89th birthday today . While the Queen's cameo role as a Bond girl came as a surprise to her grandsons, her still-sharp sense of fun did not and, as she turns 89, it's one that shows no sign of diminishing. Just last week, she was spotted looking animated and crossing her fingers at the Newbury Races while cheering on her filly, Ring of Truth. Although the two-year-old bay only managed second place, the Queen, who still goes to the races whenever she can, clearly enjoyed herself. Her Majesty is also a regular rider and is frequently spotted riding out in Windsor Great Park on her black Fell pony Carltonlima Emma - despite, as she turns 89, reaching an age where most other riders have hung up their hats for good. Sense of humour: The Queen proved her sense of humour remains undiminished with her James Bond spoof . Active: The Queen still rides regularly and is pictured out in Windsor Great Park last week . Long-standing love: The Queen, pictured in 1968 and 1972, has long adored all things equestrian . But the Queen is an expert when it comes to defying her advancing years and, along with maintaining a schedule that would leave people a third of her age exhausted, continues to enjoy herself much as she always has. Although recent years have seen her cut down on the amount of time she spends in the saddle - the result of a niggling knee injury that also forced her to give up presiding over Trooping the Colour on horseback - the Queen remains an enthusiastic equestrienne and, according to sources, is a familiar sight at her Windsor stables. She is said to take a keen interest in all her horses and ponies, some of whom are now ridden by her grandchildren, notably Prince Edward's children, Lady Louise and James, Viscount Severn. Her Majesty also puts in regular appearances at the Windsor Horse Show and is frequently seen watching the action during the Cartier Polo Cup - a tournament that takes place at the Guards' Polo Club in Windsor. Although, unlike her grandsons William and Harry, the Queen has never played polo herself, she has long been a fan of the sport. Showing her nerves: The Queen grimaces while watching her filly Ring of Truth last week . Shared love: The Duke of Edinburgh also shares her love of racing and polo . Popular: While the Queen cannot ride as much as she'd like, she still has a heavy work schedule . But while her advancing age has curtailed the Queen's ability to ride, she still partakes in many of the habits picked up as a young woman, among them a penchant for a pre-lunch gin and Dubonnet. Like her mother, who lived to be 102, Her Majesty is also said to be fond of a pre-dinner gin and tonic but turns down fancy fare in favour of plainer dishes. According to former royal chef Darren Brady, a typical lunch for Her Majesty is grilled Dover Sole served with wilted greens - that followed by an afternoon tea with 'at least two kinds of sandwiches' at four. For supper, the Queen has more fish or game such as pheasant sent to Windsor from her estate at Sandringham or Balmoral. Perhaps this hearty but plain fare explains her continuing good health and her ability to manage what remains a heavy workload . Meetings: She meets the British PM once a week and 'regularly speaks' to those elsewhere . Role: The Queen performing her role as Queen of Australia with a visit to an Aboriginal culture show in 2002 . State opening: The Queen, here as Queen of New Zealand, opening Parliament in Wellington in 1977 . Patriotic: The Queen, here of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, meeting children in Hampshire . Her Majesty  spends most afternoons welcoming incoming ambassadors to Buckingham Palace, presiding over investitures or, as she did last week, taking part in visits on behalf of one of the 16 countries of which she is head of state. She also has a weekly audience with the UK prime minister, currently David Cameron, and 'speaks regularly' to the prime ministers of the 15 other countries where she is head of state, among them Australia's Tony Abbott and Canada's Stephen Harper. Under the Queen, the monarchy has also modernised and embraces the latest technology, including social media. The Queen is currently the world's most followed royal, with her account, @BritishMonarchy, followed by 970,000 people. Her first post, an anodyne comment about the opening of an exhibition at the Science Museum, went viral - as did her first photo-bomb. The moment, which came during last summer's Commonwealth Games, saw Her Majesty appear in the background of a selfie being taken by Hockeyroos player, Jayde Taylor, 30. Her Majesty also made her first, if unscheduled, appearance in a selfie in June when 14-year-old Jack Surgenor darted in for a cheeky snap during a walkabout in Belfast's St. George's Market. Photo-bomb! This snap of the Queen by Australian hockey player Jayde Taylor rapidly went viral . First selfie: 14-year-old Jack Surgenor snaps a cheeky selfie with the Queen during a visit in Belfast . First Tweet: The Queen sends her first official Twitter message during a visit to the Science Museum . Beyond selfies and social media, the Queen continues to make waves in the sartorial world with her trademark shift dresses and colourful coats, all of which are regularly referenced by the world's top designers. Even her Launer London handbags are enjoying renewed popularity, with the brand regularly selling out colourful special edition versions of her favourite \u00a31,075 Traviata style. At home, her family are enjoying a period of relative peace and, as she celebrates her 89th birthday, the Queen is about to become a great-grandmother for the fifth time. But for Her Majesty, who is spending today privately with her family at Windsor Castle, the imminent arrival is just one of a number of reasons to be pleased. Still riding, still enjoying the races and still unafraid to surprise family and the public alike, the Queen, nearly ninety, surely is the world's coolest great-grandmother.

Busy street: Ms Flynn was in a state of sheer panic as she concerned heard passers-by screaming 'get her out because it's all going to collapse' She had been walking to her GPs on Thursday morning to pick up a prescription when a man told her to walk around a one-foot hole in the pavement. As she did so the ground gave way and she plummeted downwards. Speaking to The Sun, she added: 'I fell and I think I screamed. Bricks were falling but didn't hit me. I'm grateful I'm not badly injured.' A worker from the Marrakech Express cafe then came to the rescue opening up their basement and leading her upstairs for a coffee. 'I felt like something stronger! I was really shaky,' she joked. Ms Flynn was taken to a hospital in Fulham and was found to have suffered whiplash and bruising. Her partner Chris Jeffries, 48, claims she could have been killed in the accident. Immediately after the incident, onlookers hearing a loud scream before Ms Flynn 'disappeared' down the gap in the road and landed on the rubble below. Ambulance crews were called to the cafe at about 8.50am to provide medical care. A man takes a picture of the five foot wide by two and a half foot long hole that suddenly appeared on Thursday, exposing the cafe's basement below . At the time there was confusion over whether Ms Flynn had been pushing a pram - but this was not the case. Kate Sissons, who witnessed the fall, posted a picture on Instagram, saying: 'OMG! Poor woman and pram just disappeared down this hole on North End Rd. Shes stuck down there. She added: 'Loud scream and all I could see was the pram. Ambulance and fire on way to get her out. Scary. V v scary [sic].' A nearby flower stall owner, who asked not to be named, said she saw a man come running out of the cafe, shortly before the drama unfolded. 'The hole had been blocked off with tables and chairs but she had squeezed through and went straight down,' she said. 'She didn't have a pram or a buggy, it was a shopping trolley. 'The shop owner was shouting out to her \"Don't come through there\". 'We looked over and she was down, all the way down the hole. She had walked onto it and it had collapsed beneath her.' Scotland Yard confirmed that officers attended the scene at 8.42am and that a child had not been involved. Paul Smith, 28, a builder who was walking to work when he saw what he described as a 'shocking' scene. He said: 'Someone had fallen through - just like a trapdoor. It's crazy. There is a huge hole in the floor and someone has fallen through the pavement. 'It is about a metre wide and about eight foot deep. I couldn't see inside to see if it was a man or a woman but it was a person and the police were all around.' Atila Mohammed, who runs the Marrakech Express where the hole opened up in front of in North End Road, said he first became aware of the hole shortly before the incident. He said: 'A young man was passing, he came to me and said \"I was walking along and the pavement has broken\".' Mr Mohammed said that it was while he was checking the man was okay that woman, who was walking quite fast, approached the  hole, which at this point was only quite small. This is the first image that emerged of the incident on Thursday morning, taken by witness Kate Sissons . 'People were outside looking around and everyone said \"Stop, stop, stop\" as she put her foot on the pavement. 'I said \"stop, stop\", but I couldn't stop her. There was only a small hole from the man before, but when the lady stepped there she broke everything and it fell. 'I tried to hold her and she fell all the way down. But she's ok now I held her til the end.' He said he lowered her down the five foot wide by two and a half foot long\u00a0hole and she walked back up to the cafe via the basement and stairs and gave her a coffee while she waited for paramedics to arrive. The cafe manager claims he warned the council about the hole two years ago as he had noticed it was 'sagging'. Mr Mohammed said: 'We were shocked. We told the council nearly two years ago it looks like its sagging and they've done nothing.' Passers-by stop to take a look at the eight foot deep hole, which has been cordoned off since the incident . A cafe regular, who asked not to be named said: 'When we arrived about 9.10 all the police were here. 'We sit here every day and we were told that there was a large hole in the road and that the lady was running along the road, rushing.' The 76-year-old added: 'The cafe manager came out and grabbed her. She had a green coat and blue/black trousers, I heard. 'I thought the woman who told me was joking, but having said that there has been a big droop in that area of pavement for a long long time. I noticed it away back in February. 'I see elderly people pushing shopping trolleys along here - it could have been them we were all shocked it was an accident waiting to happen.' Laura Hill, 30, who lives in Wimbledon but works as a nanny in the area, walks up and down the road 'at least 10 times a day' and says it could have happened to anyone. 'It's an uneven pavement and a very busy area, with a bus stop really nearby. Lots of elderly people sit outside that cafe in the morning too. 'I walk up and down the street at least 10 times a day with the child I look after in a pushchair. When I heard I thought \"that could've been me\". 'It's all been boarded up now and you have to walk on the road to get past the hole now. People have been stopping to take pictures of it all day.' A London Ambulance spokesman confirmed paramedics were called to the scene at 8.53am after found the patient was 'shaken but not seriously injured' and took her to Charing Cross Hospital. Hammersmith & Fulham Council said that it is investigating claims that Mr Mohammed raised the issue with the council two months ago and the causes of the collapse. A council spokeswoman added: 'The council\u2019s structural engineer has carried out an initial investigation of the basement collapse in North End Road and secured the site. 'The freeholder of the property is legally responsible for the structural integrity of their basement but we are carrying out a full review of what\u2019s happened and will ensure the site is made safe and all necessary actions are taken once we have a full understanding of how this occurred.'

His family dispute his widow\u2019s allegations and the true extent of the tycoon\u2019s wealth will now be scrutinised by the High Court, which will assess Mrs Dellal\u2019s claim that she has been short-changed. She claims six of his children are the supposed beneficiaries of his alleged secret handouts. Siblings Lorraine, Diane, Gabrielle, Jasmine and Rowan were named along with son Guy, the father of Agent Provocateur lingerie model Alice Dellal. His grandson Alex and elderly sister Violet were also named. Yesterday, they failed in a bid to persuade a judge to throw out her claim before it could come to trial, setting the scene for a potentially explosive court battle. Mr Dellal, who was friends with celebrities including Sir Mick Jagger, was notoriously secretive about his financial dealings but is said to have gambled millions every year, regularly winning or losing up to a \u00a31million a night. He died in October 2012, aged 89, and left his entire estate to Mrs Dellal, his second wife, with nothing to his six adult children from previous relationships as he said he had already made provisions for them. Mrs Dellal, a former Miss South Africa, received \u00a315.4million and he also put \u00a320million in a trust fund for their two children, now aged 15 and 12. Son: Guy Dellal, pictured with his wife Andrea, is also being sued by his stepmother over his father's will . Granddaughters: Guy is the father of model Alice Dellal, left, and shoe designer Charlotte Dellal, right . But she claims his fortune appears to have shrunk mysteriously between his 2006 will which named her as his sole beneficiary and his death six years later. Mr Dellal, who was born in Chorlton, Manchester, to Iranian \u00e9migr\u00e9 parents, made a fortune in textiles, merchant banking and property and his wealth was once said to top \u00a31billion. Jack Dellal was the son of immigrants from Baghdad, and he started his career as a humbile textile dealer in his home city of Manchester. He became a multi-millionaire after starting a small banking business called Dalton Barton, which he sold to the bank Keyser Ullmann in 1972 for \u00a358million - more than \u00a3700million in today's money. Mr Dellal used the proceeds of the deal to set up Allied Commercial Holdings, which he used as a vehicle for property dealings for the rest of his life. In 1989, he made a vast profit from the purchase of Bush House on the Strand in central London, which was the headquarters of the BBC World Service. Allied Commercial bought the building for \u00a355million in 1987, and sold it on to Japanese firm Kato Kagaku for \u00a3130million just two years later. His final big deal came with the sale of the Art Deco Shell-Mex House, overlooking the Thames, which raked in a \u00a3150million profit when it changed hands in 2007. He had a son and four daughters from his first marriage to a former Israeli air stewardess, which ended in divorce, and two daughters from another relationship. He married his second wife in 1997 and transferred assets worth around \u00a356million to his six eldest children shortly after that wedding. By 2007 the couple\u2019s marriage was in trouble and they each consulted two of Britain\u2019s leading divorce lawyers, Raymond Tooth and Sandra Davis. Records of those meetings, revealed to the High Court, were said to show Mr Dellal did not dispute he was worth \u00a3400million. The couple did not divorce, but Mrs Dellal claims her husband began funnelling huge amounts of money into trusts for his children without her knowledge, and had a \u00a350million \u2018secret stash\u2019 hidden in an account. In his written ruling, High Court judge Mr Justice Mostyn said Mrs Dellal had argued a \u2018strong\u2019 case that her husband had access to \u2018very considerable resources\u2019, but said there was little evidence he had given it to his children in secret. He said: \u2018It goes like this. If Jack was very rich, and if his estate appears to have mysteriously shrunk, then the money can only have gone to his blood family. There are no other candidates.\u2019 Mr Dellal\u2019s family asked the judge to throw the case out as they said she cannot prove he gave money to them. They also argued Mrs Dellal\u2019s wealth meant there was \u2018no prospect\u2019 of the court awarding her any more money. She owns an \u00a38.5million mansion in Regent\u2019s Park, central London, a \u00a33million townhouse in Mayfair, the couple\u2019s \u00a35million home in Hampshire, a \u00a31.1million house in Cape Town in South Africa, cars, jewellery and art worth almost \u00a36million and has investments in the Middle East worth \u00a326.5million. Grandson: Art dealer Alex Dellal, pictured with his wife Elisa and their son Jack, is the son of Guy . She claims her fortune has been \u2018somewhat diminished\u2019 recently, although Mr Dellal\u2019s relatives argued that was down to her own mismanagement. Mr Justice Mostyn said it would be unfair to dismiss Mrs Dellal\u2019s case without further scrutiny of her late husband\u2019s finances. No date has yet been set for the case to be heard.\n"]}

If they go on to bat themselves into a strong position, they can look at it in one of two ways. England can be happy they are good enough to take wickets at home and when the ball is swinging and conditions are in their favour - like here. If that\u2019s the case then carry on as you are, but a position of strength is often a good one from which to take a long hard look at yourself and say \u2018how can we improve?\u2019 Alastair Cook needs something different to draw on in his same-same pace bowling attack . Cook is frustrated after dropping a catch off Marlon Samuel, who was on 32 and finished the day 94 not out . Cook and coach Peter Moores are under pressure to produce a result after drawing the first Test . The biggest reason England have not won away from home since 2012 is that they are lacking something different in their attack. The whole of England\u2019s bowling psyche is about containment, it\u2019s about bowling maidens and building pressure, as we saw for much of the first day here in Grenada until West Indies started to crack. That\u2019s fine and it has been very successful for them but with so much batting depth now, with Jos Buttler arguably the best Test No 8 England have ever had, they can afford to pick someone who gives them an extra ingredient. There are those who feel it could have been provided here by Adil Rashid but by all accounts he hasn\u2019t been bowling well enough to warrant selection. England have a good spinner in Moeen Ali - even though he looked rusty on day one - and a more than capable back-up in Joe Root. So perhaps that trump card could come in place of one of the four seamers who all have similar attributes. Leg-spinner Adil Rashid could offer what is needed but by all accounts he hasn\u2019t been bowling well enough . Cook speaks with paceman Mark Wood, who could be what is needed with comparisons to Simon Jones . The one I would keep an eye on is Mark Wood. From what I\u2019ve seen of him there is a bit of Simon Jones about him and the Welshman was a key element of England\u2019s best attack of the last 20 years - the 2005 Ashes line-up. Jones learnt a lot of the skills that made him the 2005 trump card on the Caribbean tour a year earlier, for instance the ability to gain skiddy reverse swing on flat pitches, and Wood might have done that now. I don\u2019t like building players up before they have played Test cricket and then quickly passing judgment on them when they are given their chance but Wood seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches. He is the sort of bowler who almost takes the pitch out of the equation - like Jones and like Darren Gough and perhaps Craig White from my day. Moeen Ali is a good spinner for England, even though he looked rusty after being recalled for Grenada . Wood seems to have that different trajectory which should suit overseas pitches on which England struggle . In England we don\u2019t produce enough of that sort of bowler and when we do get one we can hold them back a bit because they can be considered a luxury, or too much of a gamble. Look at the championship game which has just finished at Chelmsford between Essex and Kent. Wickets fell cheaply to medium-paced seam bowlers like David Masters, Jesse Ryder and Darren Stevens. Players like that will never have the attributes to take wickets overseas for England. A bowler like Tymal Mills, a left-armer with real pace who moved on from Essex to Sussex last winter, might. But will he be trusted to form part of a county attack in English conditions? Ben Stokes was the pick of the bowlers for me on day one because of the fuller length that he bowled. I was a bit surprised at how \u2018back of a length\u2019 he was in Antigua because I\u2019ve seen him play in county cricket, bowl full and reverse it. He was definitely searching for that fuller length. Ben Stokes, the pick of England's bowlers on day one, athletically fields a shot from  his own bowling . Umpire Steve Davis reprimands England's Ben Stokes after he exchanged words with Marlon Samuels . Yes, at times England bowled a bit short. It might have been a case of coming from Antigua, where it was certainly not a \u2018hit the top of off stump\u2019 pitch, to here four days later where they found conditions conducive to bowling. I would have done exactly the same as Alastair Cook and bowled first and even though England were not quite at their best wickets started to tumble. Yet you have to remember that conditions and pitches change during the course of a Test \u2014 Antigua swung for three days and then didn\u2019t for the last two \u2014 and sides have to aspire to a balanced attack. This England attack might be good enough for Grenada on a day like Tuesday but they must seek that little bit more.\n"]}

Mr Scheurle said that it was not the \u2018simplest solution\u2019, adding that similar technology is already available for piloting drones - but it could take a decade to develop it for passenger jets. Pilots associations are sceptical of the plans, with German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit saying the idea of remote control from the ground could be open to abuse.

A 'virus or malware\u2019 planted on websites visited by passengers could provide an opportunity for a malicious attack, one expert told Government Accountability Office investigators. A GAO report identified the hacking risk as one of several emerging weaknesses that the Federal Aviation Administration must address as air traffic control systems advance in technology.

The terrier, named Cookie, barked at  Joseph Devaney, 23, and Kieron Rolstron, 22, as they burst into the home of a young couple and demanded money. But as owners John and Emma Evans watched in horror, Devaney brought down the machete on the animal's head to stop it barking before making off in the victims' car. Cookie, pictured with his injuries, was slashed with a meat cleaver during the aggravated burglary in Chorley . Joseph Devaney, left, struck Cookie over the head with a meat cleaver while is accomplice Kieron Rolstron, right shouted at the terrified householders 'give me your money' and 'I will stab you' during last year's attack . Cookie suffered serious injuries and had be sedated whilst he was given stitches and is now recovering at home in Clayton Brook, near Chorley, Lancashire. At Preston Crown Court, Devaney and Rolstron were jailed after pleading guilty to aggravated burglary and aggravated vehicle taking. Devaney also pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. Rolstron was jailed for eight years seven months whilst Devaney was given nine years. The attack occurred at 10pm on September 15 last year whilst Mr and Mrs Evans' seven-year-old daughter was sleeping in her upstairs bedroom. The couple were watching TV with Cookie snoozing beside them when Devaney, who was wielding a meat cleaver and Rolstron, who was armed with a knife, raced into the living room before making demands for money and attacking the dog. As the animal yelped in agony, Rolstron, a former plaster's labourer from Bamber Bridge, began shouting over and over again, 'give me your money' before grabbing the frightened dad by his shirt. In a brave act of courage the court was told that Mr Evans attempted to reach for Rolstron's knife but he was repeatedly threatened with violence. Rolstron was said to shout 'I will stab you' before the couple were pushed into the kitchen. Both were then ordered to kneel down as the intruders repeated their demands for money despite pleas from the couple that there was none in the house. Prosecuting counsel Mr Henry Pepper told the court that Rolstron had been pointing and brandishing the knife at the couple before the duo fled from the scene with the couple's mobile telephones and car keys before making their getaway in the family's car. Preston Crown Court, pictured, heard that John and Emma Evans' seven-year-old daughter was sleeping upstairs when both men stormed into their house, attacking their dog and threatening them with violence . The court heard that Cookie, pictured, required stitches and is recovering at home following the attack . Mr Pepper said: 'Rolstron was shouting a number of times \"give me your money\" and grabbed John Evans' top. He said, \"I will stab you\" and shouted it a number of times. Both were pushed into the kitchen and both were told to kneel down. 'The occupiers were at home, there was violence used or threatened to be used, both defendants had weapons - a knife and a meat cleaver. The Crown say these weapons were present on entry, it was night time and there was a child asleep in the house. Both defendants had their faces covered.' The robbers took the couple's Citroen Picasso which was involved in a police pursuit at 1.30am the following morning after it was seen being driven dangerously through red lights and on the wrong side of the road. It was written-off after it crashed during the police chase. Both men were then located near to the crash and arrested. Rolstron was found in a field by a police helicopter whilst Devaney was found by police dogs hiding in a gazebo and in possession of one of the mobiles. The other phone is believed to have been sold soon after the theft. In a victim impact statement Mr Evans described the events as 'very frightening' and had feared he was going to be stabbed. Mrs Evans described the incident at 'absolutely terrifying'. Devaney had previous convictions for burglary, assault occasioning actual body harm, and possession of counterfeit money with intent. Rolstron had previous convictions for aggravated vehicle taking and possession of an offensive weapon. Both were also disqualified from driving for five years. For Devaney, Mr Daniel Prowse said that while violence was threatened against the victims, violence hadn't been used and said that 'mercifully' the child had remained asleep. He added that his client had shown 'clear and sincere remorse' and was 'extremely apologetic'. He added: 'He is very very sorry for his actions.' For Rolstron, Mr Philip Holden added: 'Mercifully there was no physical injury to the complainants and mercifully the child remained asleep upstairs. Mr Rolstron for what it is worth did not know there was going to be injury to the dog.' In passing sentence Judge Pamela Badley said that whatever the 'torturous' reasons had been for entering the house it had 'terrified' the couple. She said: 'One of the most unpleasant aspects was that the family pet was struck by you, Joseph Devaney. This was done to increase terror for the couple and it certainly had that effect. This was significant psychological abuse of the couple. The terror was such that you were able to achieve your aim. 'There was a child, a seven-year-old at home, she was upstairs, the commotion would not have been easy for her to ignore. The effect of the family dog would have been clear to her. Each of you were either under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 'Whilst you were there each of you knew the effect you were having on this couple and you continued in the way you did demanding money and pushing each of them around.'\n"]}

The specialised 77 Brigade, launched with great fanfare in January in response to the jihadis\u2019 mastery of online propaganda, is in disarray after failing to enlist the right personnel. Earlier this year, it was widely reported that the brigade would be made up of 2,000 social media and psychological warfare exponents who would enable UK forces to fight wars \u2018in the information age\u2019.

The businessman who brought KFC to the UK but has only ever eaten it once, says he will not go again and branded the fast-food chain 'dreadful.' Raymond Allen - who is only a handful of people in the world to know its secret recipe - opened the first franchise in Preston, Lancashire, in 1965. He had become a personal friend of Harland 'the Colonel' Sanders after meeting during a conference in Chicago 50 years ago. Mr Allen still has a personal hand-written copy of the recipe which is believed to be made up of 11 herbs and spices - and is a closely guarded secret by the firm. But the 87-year-old, from Jersey in the Channel islands, said the company has strayed so far from its original concept it's been 'ruined' and would never set foot in one again. He said: 'We have got one where I now live, but I would not go in there. I don't use it and I think it is dreadful. The company has ruined the product. 'Instead of staying with one good thing that was sellable, they have tried to compete with the other fast food units. They should have just stuck with the chicken.' His wife Shirley, 84, said: 'We tried KFC only once about a year ago. 'We had the traditional original chicken but there were so many different products it was difficult to know what to order. I don't think we will go back.' After the chance meeting in Chicago, Mr Allen helped Sanders establish the UK side of his empire while he was still a small-time restaurant owner in Louisville, Kentucky. He also gave him valuable advice on the legal side of the business including patents and was paid to seek out suitable locations for other branches across the world. He said: 'The Colonel was a very kind man, who was very forthright. 'But at the time we met he was a small-time Southern State restaurant owner, and I knew a lot about patents or registered trademarks. 'We had heard about him before the meeting. But when we first met him, he had only one franchisee in America who sold the chicken as a menu item in his restaurant. 'We were in the fast food business and thought it would be the ideal product to sell in a takeaway. 'We had several Wimpy bars so decided to convert them into KFC. That is what we did with the first one in Preston.' Mr Allen said he has a personal hand-written copy of the secret recipe for the unique taste of KFC chicken which is believed to be made up of 11 herbs and spices. He said: 'It is a lengthy recipe. I think there are 11 herbs and spices but I can't remember it off the top of my head so I couldn't tell you even if I wanted to. 'Dreadful': A KFC restaurant like the first one opened by Mr Allen in Preston, Lancashire. He said he ate one recently and found it 'dreadful' 'But it is locked away in a safe in a bank. We don't really get asked much about it. Not many people know about our involvement in it. 'We are a low key and private family and don't often talk about it. I have no idea how much it is worth but I would never sell it.' At the peak of Mr Allen's expansion of the franchise, he was opening a new shop every week through cash flow. He said: 'We were in a race against time with McDonalds as we both wanted to get the best sites. 'We wanted to expand a bit quicker than that so I walked the streets of London to go to a bank. 'We needed \u00a3100,000 trying to raise the money - but all the banks said there was no future in the business.' His company KFC UK Ltd, was eventually able to obtain a loan from Heublein Inc, a USA company which at the time owned Smirnoff Vodka. He said: 'They saw how well we were doing and lent us the money on condition that we sold the business once we had opened 100 units. That was what we did.' Mr Sanders had started his KFC business in 1930 at a service station in Corbin, Kentucky, where he began cooking for hungry travellers who stopped there for fuel, using a secret recipe for the coating of the restaurant's fried chicken. It became so popular that by 1935 the Governor of Kentucky made Mr Sanders a Kentucky Colonel in recognition of his promotion of the American state. Following the meeting Mr Allen acquired the rights to expand the KFC franchise outside the US, and returned home with big plans. He said: 'It was slow to catch on at first because people didn't know what it was. 'In the UK in those days chicken was something you ate for Sunday dinner. It was way before its time. We had to give it away to passers-by initially. 'We would only use fresh chickens, and they had to be two and a half pounds in weight. It was initially difficult to source the chickens because of the demand.' In recognition of his achievements in business, Mr Allen was named a Freeman of the City of London in 1979 and was commissioned a Kentucky Colonel in 1965. Mr and Mrs Allen sold the business in 1973.\n"]}

McDonald's announced Wednesday that it will increase starting wages for full- and part-time employees to a dollar over the minimum wage where company-owned restaurants operate. The company said the increase will be instituted starting July 1. It expects the average wage to be more than $10 an hour by the end of 2016, up from the current rate of $9 an hour. Fattening paychecks: McDonald's announced Wednesday that it will raise starting wages at its restaurants to a dollar over minimum wage beginning July 1 . McDonald's USA owns about 10 percent of the more than 14,300 McDonald's restaurants across the country, with the rest operated as franchises that will not be subject to the pay increases. The burger brand joins other large corporations raising basic pay against a backdrop of an improving economy and public pressure to increase wages. Workers at fast food chains, including McDonald's, staged protests last year, asking companies to raise wages to $15 an hour and demanding a union. Complaints in front of the National Labor Relations Board and the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration have also alleged violations including denial of overtime pay and unsafe working conditions at the restaurant chain. Meanwhile, the economy has continued to strengthen, with the unemployment rate falling from 6.7 percent to 5.5 percent over the last year. McDonald's USA President Mike Andres told the Associated Press that only a handful of McDonald's employees joined the demonstrations and that they didn't affect the company's reputation. Demonstrations: Labor organizers with a campaign to raise fast food industry wages to $15 an hour say they are fighting to unionize low-wage workers across various sectors . 'They're not taking a toll,' Andres claimed. 'It's a very competitive environment,' Andres stated. 'A significant rationale for this plan is that we want to be the most competitive and attractive employer.' Last month, McDonald's Chief Administrative Officer Pete Bensen hinted such an announcement could be in the works. Bensen said at the time that a big part of the turnaround effort in the U.S. would be what the company is doing 'around the employment image and our employee-employer relationship.' In addition to wage increases, McDonald's says workers at company-owned stores will get paid time off. Employees who have worked for the company for at least a year and work an average of 20 hours a week will be eligible to accrue about 20 hours of paid time off a year. Workers who don't take the time off will be paid for the value of that time, McDonald's said. Kwanza Brooks, a McDonald's worker in North Carolina, called the move 'too little to make a real difference.' 'Raising wages only a little for only a small fraction isn't change. It's a pure stunt,' she said in a conference call set up by labor organizers. McDonald's US business has been struggling, with sales and customers counts at established locations falling two years in a row. In January, the company named Steve Easterbrook, its chief brand officer, as its new CEO. That change took effect last month. 'We know that a motivated workforce leads to better customer service so we believe this initial step not only benefits our employees, it will improve the McDonald's restaurant experience,' Easterbrook said in a statement Wednesday. McDonald's also said it is expanding benefits to help workers at company- and franchise-owned restaurants complete high school and college. It did not immediately provide details on that program.\n"]}

Benteke has two years left on his contract once this season is completed and harbours ambitions to play in Europe. Sherwood said the Belgium international had given no suggestion he would like a transfer away and appeared to be enjoying his football at Villa Park. But the Villa manager admitted that, were the 24-year-old to demand a move, as he did two years ago, he would be inclined to sanction it. Villa are believed to value Benteke at upwards of \u00a325million and Wolfsburg have monitored his situation. Benteke has scored eight goals in his last six matches. Aston Villa striker Christian Benteke could be sold in the summer if he wants to go, says boss Tim Sherwood . The 24-year-old has two years left on his contract but harbours ambitions to play in Europe . Sherwood\u00a0said there would likely be talks over Benteke\u2019s \u00a350,000-a-week contract during the summer . \u2018We don\u2019t want to sell our best players,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018I also want players who want to play at the football club. \u2018He\u2019s made no indication to me that he wants to play elsewhere. If he does then we will assess the situation but we want to keep him at the club. \u2018You can\u2019t force any player, I\u2019ve been one myself. You might as well take the money because you end up without the money or the player if you don\u2019t take it.\u2019 Sherwood said there would likely be talks over Benteke\u2019s \u00a350,000-a-week contract during the summer. \u2018I know better how Tottenham went about their business regarding their contracts. I\u2019m not too sure how they go about it here,\u2019 said Sherwood. \u2018But it\u2019s certainly something that will have to be addressed. You don\u2019t really want players going into the last 18 months of their contract, he\u2019s someone for the long-term future and you need to protect your interests.\u2019 Sherwood accepts winning the FA Cup, meaning a place in the Europa League, could help. \u2018That would put everyone in a good mood, not only Christian,\u2019 he said. \u2018I think he is enjoying his time here and everyone is seeing that. He is a top player. We have a lot of top players in here and no-one wants to fight relegation. If we can get through this season we will build something where we are going to step upwards \u2014 we won\u2019t be in that position again.\u2019 Sherwood also wants to wipe any smile from Raheem Sterling\u2019s face by causing an FA Cup shock at Wembley on Sunday. Benteke (second left) scored the only goal of the game as Villa won 1-0 at Tottenham on April 11 . That goal at White Hart Lane was the Belgium international's eighth in his last six games for club and country . Footage this week emerged showing the Liverpool forward inhaling nitrous oxide, a legal high commonly known as laughing gas because it creates feelings of euphoria. Sherwood said: \u2018Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s not laughing after Sunday.\u2019 The Villa boss knows his ambitions to beat Liverpool and reach the FA Cup final may rest on taming Sterling, a player he tried to sign for Tottenham\u2019s academy as a schoolboy. The 20-year-old is enduring a tough time off the pitch, in a contract stand-off with Liverpool and coming under question for his recreational activities. Sherwood added: \u2018I have a wee bit of sympathy. I am not condoning it, but he is a young man, isn\u2019t he? He obviously has fortunes but is growing up like everyone else. It is tough in the public eye.\u2019 Raheem Sterling (right) was pictured smoking a shisha pipe with team-mate Jordon Ibe earlier this season . Another Liverpool player Sherwood discussed on Friday was Steven Gerrard, whose birthday falls on the FA Cup final on May 30. Those associated with the Merseyside club feel an ideal silverware send-off is brewing before Gerrard heads to LA Galaxy. \u2018Believe it or not it\u2019s not about spoiling the party for Steven Gerrard,\u2019 insisted Sherwood. \u2018It\u2019s about what we can do. To be honest we\u2019re hoping he\u2019s on his holiday in May.\u2019 Sherwood played against a teenage Gerrard in his latter days and hailed the 34-year-old\u2019s clear talent from the off. He added: \u2018I\u2019m sure Steven could still do a job for a Premier League side but I\u2019m not sure he can go and play for anyone other than Liverpool. He can earn \u00a31 a week or \u00a3200,000, he\u2019ll still play the same way. That\u2019s a dying breed \u2014 there aren\u2019t many of them about.\u2019 Liverpool have captain Steven Gerrard (centre) back for the FA Cup semi after serving a three-match ban . Sherwood has led a Villa resurgence since taking over in February, steering the club away from relegation danger and into this Wembley showpiece. They are on a run of four wins in seven. He believes his team can upset favourites Liverpool. \u2018It\u2019s a very exciting game, a great opportunity for this club to get to an FA Cup final,\u2019 he said. \u2018I\u2019ve lost semi-finals myself, not a great feeling. \u2018We\u2019re going in with a positive state of mind. This club\u2019s relegation is not at stake, it is about us maybe getting some glory for the football club. \u2018We have the mindset to win the game, impose ourselves on a very good Liverpool side. We have a good blend of players who can play and maybe go direct at times.

The kid's six legs were of similar length initially, but as he grew two of the forelegs became shorter than the rest and can no longer touch the ground. Mr Xiao said the six-legged kid was born to two normal 'lake goats' and he was puzzled as to what caused the mutation. He said he will not take the kid to the vet to remove the two extra legs.

The lawsuit, which has 750 plantiffs and includes victims and their families, is seeking $1billion, claiming that officials from Hopkins approved the study at the time and even helped to plan and monitor it as it ran from 1945 to 1956. The few victims who are still alive were almost all children when they were unknowingly infected, and many among them were orphans. In the aftermath of the experiment, some of the individuals died of syphilis, with open sores covering their bodies, while those who did survive claim they passed the disease down to their children, ending up with babies that were born blind, severely handicapped, and, in at least one case, without a brain. It is estimated approximately 700 people were infected with the disease, and of the roughly 75% who were treated, only 25% were reported to have completed their treatment. Scroll down for video . Marta Orellana (above) was just 9-years-old when one day at the orphanage she was ordered to go to the infirmary and infected with the disease . Federico Mesa (above) was a solider who was forcibly injected with syphilis as a soldier and passed it along to his family . In a $1billion lawsuit, 750 plaintiffs claim Johns Hopkins (above) approved and helped to plan the study, which ran from 1945 to 1956 . Marta Orellana was just 9-years-old when one day at the orphanage she was ordered to go to the infirmary. She was told the lie down and spread her legs, which she resisted at first, but eventually succumbed to the doctors around her. At that point she claims that men with gauze or cotton on their fingers penetrated her, infecting her with syphilis. A few weeks later they called her in to take fluid from her spine, and she says when she turned around to look it was yellow. Even after the study ended she recalls one instance in which she saw one of her doctors and was convinced he was going to kidnap her to continue studying her. In addition to orphans, soldiers, prisoners, mental patients and prostitutes were also sought out for the study. Prostitutes in particular, who would be injected with the disease and then sent to sleep with prisoners. Marta Ruiz's (above) husband was infected, and she gave birth to one child who did not have a brain . Ruiz's other child was born severely handicapped (above) Marta Cesarea P\u00e9rez Ruiz did not get infected with the disease during the experiemnt, but her husband did, and it caused major problems with two of their children when he passed it along to her. One was born without a brain, while another was born with syphilis which was left untreated, and is now severely handicapped. Another woman, Victoria, was born blind, which she believes to be a result of her father having been infected with the disease and, again, not having been treated when she was born with syphilis. Federico Mesa, like Orellana, is one of the few original patients still alive. He was a solider at the time he was first infected, and acknowledges that he infected his wife and others with the disease. He was injected with the disease he claims and subjected to numerous tests, and never once told what any of them were for. The United States government only admitted to this experiment in 2010, which was run by Dr. John Cutler (above) Dr. Cutler was also known for his infamous syphilis experiment in Tuskegee, Alabama (above) The United States government only admitted to this experiment in 2010, which was run by Dr. John Cutler, also known for his infamous experiment in Tuskegee, Alabama. In that study, conducted between 1932 and 1972, Dr. Cutler and the US Public Health Service found\u00a0African-American men in Alabama who had syphilis and claimed they were treating them for the disease, when they were not in fact doing so but rather studying how it progressed. They also unknowingly infected some men with syphilis who did not have the disease. Dr. Cutler defended the experiment even after public outcry had shut it down, saying in 1993: 'It was important that they were supposedly untreated, and it would be undesirable to go ahead and use large amounts of penicillin to treat the disease, because you\u2019d interfere with the study.' He would at one point in his career be appointed assistant Surgeon General of the United States. In the end, the experiment resulted in the death of at least 83 individuals from syphilis. In 1974, a $10million settlement was awarded along with lifetime medical benefits and burial services to all living participants. Those benefits later grew to include all direct family members of victims in 1975. In that study, conducted between 1932 and 1972, Dr. Cutler and the US Public Health Service infected some African-American men in Alabama with syphilis . Guatemalan President Alvaro Colom (right) described the syphilis experiments as 'crimes against humanity' at the time while President Obama and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton apologized (left) A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against the U.S. government by many of the same plaintiffs in the current Hopkins lawsuit back in 2012. That suit listed then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius as defendants, who released a statement at the time saying; 'Although these events occurred more than 64 years ago, we are outraged that such reprehensible research could have occurred under the guise of public health.' They then added; 'We deeply regret that it happened, and we apologize to all the individuals who were affected by such abhorrent research practices.' And while the case was dismissed on a legal technicality, Judge Reggie B. Walton, who rendered the decision, urged the plaintiffs to appeal for the compensation they deserve. The US government cannot be held responsible in a court of law for any action committed in another country. 'For more than half a century since the time of the Guatemala study, scholars, ethicists and clinicians have worked with government officials to establish rigorous ethical standards for human research. Johns Hopkins welcomes bioethical inquiry into the U.S. Government's Guatemala study and its legacy,' Hopkins spokeswoman Kim Hoppe told The Baltimore Sun said in an email. 'This lawsuit, however, is an attempt by plaintiffs' counsel to exploit a historic tragedy for monetary gain.' One of the attorneys for Hopkins meanwhile calls this suit 'baseless.' It was\u00a0medical historian Susan Reverby from Wellesley College in Massachusetts who first unearthed the shocking details of the tests while researching Dr. Cutler's archives in Pennsylvania. 'I was just completely blown away. I was floored,' she said at the time. 'I expected to find something on Tuskegee. There was nothing. What he left behind were these records from the Guatemala study.' She then said; 'That was all he left behind. Why he did this, I have no idea. Why would you leave this?'\n"]}
{"question_id": 881, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)When drinkers in Clayton's, a beachfront bar in South Padre Island, Texas, belly up for a round of shots, bartender Casey Belue can usually guess what they'll order. It comes in a yellow-labeled bottle with a fire-breathing demon on it. It tastes like Big Red chewing gum. It's Fireball Cinnamon Whisky, and lately it's been as hot as its name. \"Fireball is number one, definitely. That's pretty much the chosen shot,\" said Belue, who enjoys it herself now and then. \"On an average night, we probably go through three or four bottles.\" If you're young -- say, under 35 -- this may not be news to you. Fireball, which didn't exist in its current form a decade ago, is the fastest-growing big brand of liquor in America. Retail sales more than doubled last year, and Fireball has come seemingly out of nowhere to become the sixth-most popular liquor brand in the U.S. as measured by retail sales -- ahead of such venerable labels as Jim Beam, Jose Cuervo and Grey Goose. And these figures don't include sales in bars, where Fireball has dethroned Jagermeister as America's party shot of choice. Or social media feeds, which fill with photos of Fireball-flavored revelry and #FireballFriday hashtags. \"Fireball is an incredible phenomenon. The growth of it has just been astounding,\" said Lew Bryson, managing editor of Whisky Advocate and author of several books on whiskey and other spirits. \"For a whiskey, this is unprecedented.\" To the uninitiated, Fireball is basically made from Canadian whisky, aged in used bourbon barrels, flavored with sweetener and spicy cinnamon. (The \"whisky\" spelling generally refers to Scotches or Canadian varieties, while \"whiskey\" refers to Irish or American styles.) Its slogan is \"Tastes like heaven, burns like hell,\" but that's an exaggeration. Fireball has a kick, but it doesn't burn as much as straight whiskeys, cheap tequilas or even the Atomic Fireball hard candy that helped inspire its name. It's also only 66 proof, or 33% alcohol -- less than most whiskeys. \"It's so easy to drink that you forget you're drinking alcohol. It's very sweet. You hardly taste the whiskey at all,\" said Zachary Jones, a bartender at Community Smith in Atlanta. \"I've known people who can't do shots, but they can do Fireball.\" Fireball is especially popular among young drinkers and women, many of whom say they like that it doesn't singe their throat and leaves a Dentyne-like aftertaste. But not everyone is a fan. Whiskey enthusiasts -- the types who can talk knowledgeably about single-malt Scotches -- mostly turn up their noses at the stuff. \"I've got to be honest: It's not anything I'd reach for, at any occasion,\" Bryson said. \"But clearly I'm not in the mainstream.\" Fireball wasn't always Fireball. It used to be known as Dr. McGillicuddy's Fireball Whisky before its maker, the Sazerac Co., rebranded it in 2006. Sales were modest until about five years ago, when Sazerac hired a \"national brand ambassador,\" Richard Pomes, to spread the word about Fireball through event planning and bartender outreach. In other words, Pomes traveled the country serving up Fireball shots in bars. He started in college towns and cities with vibrant bar cultures, such as Austin and Nashville, and then spread to other places. Everywhere he went, Pomes shared his Fireballing exploits on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and encouraged patrons to do the same. Soon, Fireball started gaining traction. Then it exploded. Retail sales jumped from just under $2 million in 2011 to $63 million in 2013 to $130 million last year, according to IRI, a Chicago-based market research firm. Along the way, Sazerac has cultivated a party-hearty social ethos around Fireball, encouraging pics of shots with hashtags such as #WhiskyWednesday. The brand has more than 85,000 followers on Twitter and another 43,000 on Instagram -- more than twice the social reach of Jagermeister -- although on Twitter, it still trails Jack Daniel's whiskey and Patron tequila. And it got a boost in October when someone taped a GoPro camera to a large bottle of the liquor and filmed dozens of guests chugging from it at a wedding reception. The resulting video has more than 2.3 million YouTube views. \"Our fans love it, and they spread the word. The Fireball nation is devoted -- and this is the best kind of marketing,\" said Amy Preske, public relations and events manager for Sazerac, who declined to offer any further explanation for the brand's booming popularity. \"We are very excited and humbled.\" So is Fireball a future cornerstone of every well-stocked bar or just a fad? It may be too soon to say. Retail sales remain strong, according to IRI, although Fireball's skyrocketing growth has slowed in recent months. But it's under siege from several fronts. The past year has brought copycats Jim Beam Kentucky Fire and Jack Daniels Tennessee Fire, both bourbon whiskeys infused with spicy cinnamon syrup, along with cinnamon vodkas, cinnamon tequilas and other cinnamon liqueurs. Fireball also endured a public-relations mess last fall when several European countries briefly recalled the liquor over concerns about one of its ingredients: propylene glycol, a chemical used in a variety of food products, e-cigarettes and antifreeze. Sazerac responded that propylene glycol exists in Fireball \"in very small quantities\" -- less than 1/8th of the amount allowed by the FDA (PDF) -- and reassured customers that Fireball is \"absolutely safe to drink.\" Then there's the question of whether Fireball will become a victim of its own success. Young consumers are notoriously fickle, and there is anecdotal evidence that some people are getting sick of it. \"It just reached a point where I couldn't drink it anymore,\" said Jones, the Atlanta bartender. \"I think it was the sugar.\" Still, its popularity remains on display nightly wherever young people gather. Glasses are raised, someone makes a toast, and down go shots of an orange, syrupy and seemingly unstoppable concoction. \"It's an easy shot. You can drink a lot of them. With Fireball, you don't need a chaser,\" said Kelvin Davis, a bartender at the Nook in Atlanta. \"It's the one thing I can throw out there and it never fails.\"\n"]}
{"question_id": 882, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)The onslaught on Houthis rebels in Yemen continued Tuesday, with the Saudi-led coalition asserting increasing control while locals fled the chaos and casualties piled up -- dozens of civilians among them. Five days after their first airstrikes, the coalition has destroyed air defense systems of the Houthis and supporters of Yemen's longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh, and rendered all but a fraction of air bases and stripes unusable, a Saudi source said. Saudi Arabia's navy now controls all Yemeni ports, allowing only closely watched non-military medical goods to pass its blockade, according to the source. This effort isn't over, including widespread attempts to locate and destroy Scud missiles still in the country, the source said. The Saudis appear intent on seeing it through, as evidenced by remarks from Saudi Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal in Riyadh. \"The Houthi militia and agents of the former president -- supported by Iran -- insist to meddle in Yemen, reshuffle the cards, rob the Yemeni will, make a coup against the constitutional legitimacy and reject all peaceful solutions,\" al-Faisal said, according to the state-run Saudi Press Agency. \"We are not warmongers,\" he added. \"But if war's drums are beaten, we are ready for them.\" The airstrikes -- the latest focused around Aden, Taiz and coastal cities -- come at a cost, and not just to Houthi rebel fighters. The International Red Cross said that intense fighting had brought \"disturbing reports of civilian casualties,\" with some of the worst violence around the port city of Aden. Erich Ogoso, a spokesman with the United Nations' humanitarian agency, reported 182 dead and hundreds more wounded just between last Wednesday and Sunday. Some 75,000 people have been displaced in the past week,  many health facilities shut down and food prices have skyrocketed. \"Increasing hostilities have led to (the) targeting of schools, health facilities and other social infrastructure,\" Ogoso said. \"... There are reports of damage to residential areas in different cities, and in Aden, minors have reportedly taken part in the fighting on all sides.\" Airstrikes that hit the Al-Mazraq camp for displaced persons near Sanaa killed at least 29 people -- women and children among them, according to aid group Doctors Without Borders. About 1,100 families live in the camp, said U.N.'s humanitarian affairs coordinator for Yemen, Johannes Van Der Klaauw. \"They are,\" he said, \"among the most vulnerable people in Yemen.\" Yemen has been in disarray for some time, beset by widespread poverty and insecurity. Those factors helped terror groups like al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula find homes in the Arab nation, but didn't help its 26 million citizens in their quest for peace and prosperity. The instability escalated as the Houthis, a minority group long marginalized in Yemen, increasingly challenged the government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi (who in 2012 took over for Saleh, who had been in power for 33 years). The Houthis began moving into Sanaa in September, then headed into Aden earlier this month -- advancing despite intermittent (and, time and again, unsuccessful) talks aimed a peaceful political solution to the unrest. Things finally came to a head last week, with Hadi -- who claims to still be President, even though the Houthis control government institutions -- left Yemen. At roughly the same time, Saudi Arabia and its allies came in with force to support Hadi, who they say remains Yemen's legitimate leader. The burgeoning conflict threatened to open a wider rift, not just in the region but in the Muslim world. That's because the Saudis have painted the Houthis as tools of Iran's government, an accusation that also reflects the fact Saudi Arabia (and their allies in the coalition) are predominantly Sunni Muslims, while Iran and the Houthis are Shiites. The state-run Saudi Press Agency quoted Saudi Minister of Foreign Affairs Prince Saud al-Faisal as saying Tuesday that he would not condemn Iran, but would instead test the country's intentions \"by extending our hands to it as a Muslim neighbor to open a new page.\" If those two countries could achieve real cooperation, it could ease the pressures that are tearing Yemen apart. On the other side, Iranian Deputy Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said that officials in his country and Saudi Arabia can help bring about a \"political solution\" in Yemen, according to Iran's state-run Press TV, citing AFP. If they don't, war could inflame the entire region. \"We strongly object to the military solution in Yemen,\" Amir-Abdollahian said, reiterating a view made by other Iranian officials. \"We believe that the Saudi military attack against Yemen is a strategic mistake.\"\n"]}
{"question_id": 883, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Are we alone in the cosmos? Or might there be intelligent life elsewhere? Last week, NASA scientists discussed in very concrete terms the steps to discovering life elsewhere in the universe over the next decade or two. This year is the 20th anniversary of the discovery of a planet around a star like our own sun, 51 Pegasi. Since then, ground-based surveys and NASA's Kepler satellite have discovered nearly 2,000 confirmed \"exoplanets,\" and thousands more candidates await confirmation. Many of these planetary systems are quite unlike our own solar system. Some have large planets like Jupiter that orbit their stars far closer than Mercury, the innermost planet in our solar system. But smaller rocky planets like Earth, though harder to find, appear to be even more abundant. Life on Earth developed in its oceans about a billion years after the planet formed. That suggests that rocky planets with liquid water on their surfaces might also have developed primitive forms of life. Life as we know it is carbon-based and requires liquid water. Astronomers define the \"habitable zone\" around a star as the region within which liquid water can exist on a planet's surface. Any closer to the star, the water will boil into vapor; any farther and the water freezes into ice. Extrapolating from discoveries to date, astronomers estimate there are perhaps 40 billion Earth-like, habitable-zone planets in our Milky Way galaxy alone. Of course, there is a difference between single-celled organisms -- which developed 3.8 billion years ago and remained the most sophisticated form of life for another billion years or so -- and mammals, which appeared about 200 million years ago. And then the humans, who have existed for only 200,000 years. Intelligent life that can communicate via radio waves with other intelligent life is less than 100 years old here on Earth. So while planets that develop simple forms of life may be a dime a dozen, the number that have sentient beings with whom to converse -- even assuming they evolved as humans did, with ears and spoken language, or eyes and written language -- is likely to be tiny. And life that can use radio waves has existed on Earth for only 0.000002% of the planet's history -- 100 years out of 4.5 billion. If the half dozen or so rocky, Earth-like exoplanets now known are similar, the odds of discovering humanlike life on them are about the same as, well, winning your state lottery with one ticket. Of course, if there are 40 billion Earth-like planets out there, the odds improve quite a bit. If they all have histories like the Earth's, there might be 1,000 planets in the Milky Way that could support communicative beings. But before you start composing your first letter to an alien, think about this: The chance that those beings evolved on exactly the same time scale is minuscule. Another planet's 100 years of brilliance might have occurred a billion years ago, or it might happen a billion years in the future. A lot depends on how long communication capabilities last. Civilizations that can build huge telescopes and broadcast stations also have the technology to destroy their planet. So the duration of the Communication Age on a planet could be short. Not to mention: The average light-travel-time to such a planet could be tens of thousands of years, so unless humans evolve to be ageless, we're not exchanging IMs with aliens anytime soon. If advanced civilizations can maintain their capabilities for millions of years or more, the chances of communicating with them are not negligible. But in that case, they are likely to be far more sophisticated than we are (since they developed the capability far earlier than we did) -- so if they wanted us to know they exist, wouldn't they simply tell us? The SETI project has been listening for such broadcasts for more than 30 years in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Probably the most likely form of life on exoplanets is far more primitive. Astronomers have found signatures of organic molecules, the building blocks of life, in the interstellar material that permeates the space between stars in our galaxy. Possible signatures of living organisms on distant exoplanets include an oxygen-rich atmosphere, such as that created by the first bacteria on Earth, or perhaps methane or carbon dioxide. NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, to be launched in 2018, will look for evidence of life in the atmospheres of rocky, habitable exoplanets. NASA's rovers have shown that Mars was once much more habitable. It had fresh-water lakes and streams of water running along its surface. Some water still remains, and there may yet be life discovered on Mars. New missions plan to look at Europa and Ganymede, moons of Jupiter that have liquid water below their icy surfaces. Life elsewhere in the universe, and even elsewhere in our own Milky Way galaxy, is practically inevitable. Signs of life on exoplanets orbiting nearby stars will probably be discovered in the coming decades with advanced telescopes. But the chance of talking to those little green men will probably have to wait for another few hundred million years.\n"]}

Ms. Mihai separated from her New Zealand born partner after a two-year relationship. She was awarded full custody of their son, with her ex partner having little contact with Chris. Once they separated, immigration had Ms Mihai's Visa cancelled. 'I had to apply for a temporary Visa and residency,' she said. 'That was almost a year ago, and I've been fighting with them ever since.'

'Immigration doesn't take all of the facts into consideration,' she said. In order for Chris to move to Romania to be with his mother, his father would need to sign a contract allowing him to go, which Ms Mihai strongly doubts.

Dr Giorgi-Guarnieri testified on Friday during court hearings in Washington, D.C., that will ultimately determine whether and under which conditions John Hinckley Jr. will be allowed to live full time outside a mental hospital. Giorgi-Guarnieri said Hinckley should be allowed to start the band but not perform publicly. One of Hinckley's interests is music, and he sings and plays the guitar. He also participates in music therapy. John Hinckley Jr, in 2014, the would-be assassin of President Ronald Reagan, pictured for the first time since a court ruled he can spend 17 days a month away from a mental home where he has been for the last three decades at his mother's Virginia home . Secret Service agents and bystanders attend to those injured in the assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan by John Hinckley Jr on March 30, 1981. \u00a0Hinckley's lawyers said mental illness drove the then 25-year-old Hinckley to shoot the President in an effort to impress actress Jodie Foster . Hinckley's lawyer and treatment team say he's ready to live full time at his 89-year-old mother's home in Virginia under certain conditions. Hinckley has been allowed freedom in stages. He spends 17 days a month at his mother's Williamsburg home. If the man who shot President Reagan is allowed to leave a mental hospital for good, he should have to live under strict conditions, wearing an ankle monitoring device and driving a car with a GPS tracking device, government lawyers said on Thursday. Hinckley's attorney, Barry Levine, said on Wednesday on the first day of hearings that Hinckley is 'clinically ready' to live permanently outside the hospital, a position supported by his treatment team. Levine said that the mental illness that drove the then 25-year-old Hinckley to shoot the president in 1981 in an effort to impress actress Jodie Foster has been in 'full and stable remission' for more than two decades. But Levine and government lawyers disagree about the conditions Hinckley should have to comply with if he is allowed to live full-time outside of St. Elizabeth's mental hospital in Washington, his home since a jury found him not guilty by reason of insanity in the shooting. Prosecutors have proposed about three dozen conditions if Hinckley lives permanently at his mother's home in Williamsburg. Hinckley in his police mugshot in 1981 after he shot President Reagan.

Those restrictions include monitoring software on the home's computer and a ban on searching for information about: himself, Reagan, Foster, and Reagan press secretary James Brady, who also was injured in the shooting. Prosecutors also want him prohibited from setting up social media accounts on sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, at least partly because he has been diagnosed with a narcissistic personality disorder, though his doctors say its effects have diminished. Hinckley's lawyers and the hospital oppose many of the restrictions. VJ Hyde, one of the people involved with Hinckley's case at St. Elizabeths, testified on Thursday that it could be helpful for Hinckley to explore information about himself, including news stories and information about the shooting and the people he hurt. Hyde also said the hospital 'adamantly opposes' requiring Hinckley to wear an ankle monitor. Hyde said 'many people don't recognize' Hinckley anymore, and he said the monitor would further stigmatize him. The judge overseeing Hinckley's case, U.S. District Judge Paul L. Friedman, previously rejected prosecutors' request to have Hinckley wear an ankle monitor during the 17-day visits to his mother's home. Freedom for Hinckley, who turns 60 next month, has come gradually. For a dozen years, Friedman has allowed him increasing freedom, with the purpose of reintegrating him into society. Friedman first agreed in 2003 that he could have day visits with his family in the Washington area, then local overnight visits. Visits with his parents in Williamsburg followed. Those were expanded to 17 days by the judge in late 2013. It will ultimately be up to Friedman whether to let Hinckley live full time in Williamsburg and, if so, under what conditions. Some of the conditions attorneys are discussing are ones Hinckley already complies with while in Williamsburg and which both sides agree on: carrying a GPS-enabled cellphone, not talking to the media, and attending individual and group therapies. The U.S. Secret Service also keeps watch on Hinckley now and then, but it's not a condition of his release.

He unleashed an extraordinary expletive-filled rant outside court this week after he was re-bailed for sentence following his failure to turn up to a previous hearing. Scott Stephenson shouted and swore outside court after he was bailed ahead of his sentencing for a theft in which he stole a phone from a man dying of hypothermia . Stephenson was due to be sentenced for the offence, but failed to turn up to a previous court hearing . Scott Stephenson had been due to be jailed for the incident after admitting theft, but he skipped bail until he was arrested and sent back to court. The 19-year-old, from South Shields,  rifled through his 22-year-old unnamed victim's pockets and made off with the iPhone 4. His victim had tripped and fallen unconscious on the cold December day. Stephenson and friend Dale Walker, 25, found him but - instead of calling for help - took his phone and abandoned the man. The next morning the victim's body was discovered close to a playground, and a post mortem examination revealed he had died from hypothermia during the cold December night. Stephenson found the man lying on the floor on a cold December evening but instead of calling for help he and friend stole the man's iPhone . Members of the public looked on in horror during the extraordinary outburst near Newcastle Crown Court . Stephenson made rude gestures outside South Tyneside Magistrates when he appeared last month to plead guilty to theft and Walker admitted handling stolen goods. Appearing before Newcastle Crown Court on Tuesday, Stephenson made similar gestures as he stood on the street where members of the public were eating lunch. He was seized on Monday after a warrant was issued for his arrest when his failure to appear left his co-defendant sitting in the dock alone and his victim's family in anguish. He was re-bailed for the sentence - which will be arranged for a later date after a pre-sentence report has been prepared.\n"]}

Because, according to her, she has cancer. That's what she said in a video posted to Facebook that shows her group packing up from their Alaska Airlines plane as it sat at the gate in Hawaii. \"You're taking me off the airplane because I don't have a doctor's note saying I can fly,\" a woman is heard saying. \"All these people are waiting, and I'm being removed as if  I'm a criminal or contagious, because I have cancer and no note to fly.\" Sedway did eventually get on a flight back to San Jose, California, although she didn't get home until late Tuesday night. And she got an apology. \"We regret the inconvenience Ms. Sedway experienced ... and are very sorry for how the situation was handled,\" Alaska Airlines spokeswoman Bobbie Egan said. \"... While our employee had the customer's well-being in mind, the situation could have been handled differently.\" Her cancer fight notwithstanding, Sedway was in Hawaii in time to celebrate her 14th wedding anniversary. Still, on Monday, she was on a plane to head east. Then, according to her Facebook post, an airline employee who saw Sedway seated in the handicapped section asked her how she was doing. The second time she inquired, Sedway wrote that she responded by saying she sometimes felt weak. That was followed by a call to a doctor, then her removal from the plane. Egan, the Alaska Airlines spokeswoman, acknowledged that the carrier's policy when someone has a medical issue is to call MedLink, a group of ER nurses and doctors. The idea, she explained, is that \"it is better to address medical issues or concerns on the ground rather than in the air, especially on flights to or from Hawaii\" -- which in that case would last five-plus hours over open ocean. The decision to pull Sedway from the flight was done with \"the customer's well-being\" in mind, according to Egan. Still, that doesn't mean it was the right decision. Alaska Airlines since apologized to Sedway \"for the disruption this has caused,\" in addition to refunding her family's tickets and paying for their overnight accommodations.\" Even though she was stuck in Hawaii, Sedway made clear on Facebook that this was a real \"disruption.\" \"Because of this, I will miss my chemotherapy, my children will miss school and my husband will miss important meetings,\" she said.\n"]}

Robert Preston Boardwine provided his friend Joyce Rosemary Bruce with sperm and she impregnated herself using the kitchen accessory in 2010. She had opted for the bizarre method of conception because she believed that the absence of intercourse would mean Mr Boardwine had no parental rights. After the boy was born, the pair disagreed on the level of involvement Mr Boardwine would have in his son's life, with Ms Bruce intent on raising him alone. Unusual method: A court in Richmond, Virginia, has ruled that even though Joyce Rosemary Bruce impregnated herself using a turkey baster and Robert Preston Boardwine's sperm, he still has parental rights . Mr Boardwine had envisioned being more involved in the child's life, telling a lower court he had hoped to 'attend the boy's sporting events some day', and have a say in major decisions such as school. The Virginia Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that as the child's biological father, Mr Boardwine is more than a sperm donor and is entitled to be a part of his son's life. 'The path to fatherhood may have been unconventional,' the court said, but it doesn't remove Boardwine's parental rights. According to court filings, Ms Bruce impregnated herself with a turkey baster, believing that Mr Boardwine would not have any parental rights because they did not have intercourse. Mr Boardwine had agreed after some trepidation to provide the sperm, and the pair underwent several tries before Ms Bruce fell pregnant. They discussed a written contract but never signed one, a court heard. 'Bruce used an ordinary turkey baster to inseminate herself,' the court said. 'No other person was involved. They did not go to a doctor's office or to a medical facility.' After several visits from Mr Boardwine in 2010, Ms Bruce learned that she was pregnant in July. Their good relationship continued for the early part of the pregnancy, with Mr Boardwine visiting and bringing a stuffed bear and baby clothes. However, Ms Bruce  wanted him to be only 'as involved as her other friends', a lower court was told, while he sought  a more active role \u2014 attendance at the boy's sporting events someday, and a voice in major decisions. Ms Bruce fell pregnant after several 'tries' using Mr Boardwine's sperm, but despite an initially friendly relationship, the pair fell out when she rejected his suggestion for a name for their son . The relationship soured when Ms Bruce rejected Mr Boardwine's suggested name for the child. They didn't speak for about five months, until the boy was born and Boardwine showed up at the hospital. Later visits to her home were 'sort of strained,' Ms Bruice said, and she eventually told Boardwine to stay away. Ms Bruce argued that Boardwine had no rights because, under the state's assisted conception law, he was merely a sperm donor. But the law defines assisted conception as a pregnancy resulting from 'medical technology,' and that definition doomed her argument. 'The plain meaning of the term 'medical technology' does not encompass a kitchen implement such as a turkey baster,' Judge Stephen R. McCullough wrote for the appeals court. Ms Bruce can still appeal to the Virginia Supreme Court.\n"]}

'Prince Harry has been to Australia twice before, so he knows he is in for a great experience. He particularly appreciates the opportunity to pay his respects to the fallen and fully appreciates the significance of commemoration in this centenary year of the Gallipoli campaign.'

The hot spot, near the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, covers only about 2,500 square miles (6,500 square kilometers), or half the size of Connecticut. A recent Nasa map shows is produces more than triple the standard ground-based estimate - and researchers say they don't know why.. Scroll down for video . The Four Corners area (red) is the major U.S. hot spot for methane emissions in this map showing how much emissions varied from average background concentrations from 2003-2009 (dark colors are lower than average; lighter colors are higher). The hot spot, near the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah, covers only about 2,500 square miles. Methane is very efficient at trapping heat in the atmosphere. Like carbon dioxide, it contributes to global warming. To calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air, the authors performed high-resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model, which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds. Researchers from several institutions are now in the Four Corners region of the U.S. Southwest with a suite of airborne and ground-based instruments, aiming to uncover reasons for a mysterious methane 'hot spot' detected from space. 'With all the ground-based and airborne resources that the different groups are bringing to the region, we have the unique chance to unequivocally solve the Four Corners mystery,' said Christian Frankenberg, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California, who is heading NASA's part of the effort. Other investigators are from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) in Boulder, Colorado; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA); and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. Last fall, researchers including Frankenberg reported that a small region around the Four Corners intersection of Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico and Utah had the highest concentration of methane over background levels of any part of the United States. An instrument on a European Space Agency satellite measuring greenhouse gases showed a persistent atmospheric hot spot in the area between 2003 and 2009. The amount of methane observed by the satellite was much higher than previously estimated. The satellite observations were not detailed enough to reveal the actual sources of the methane in the Four Corners. Likely candidates include venting from oil and gas activities, which are primarily coalbed methane exploration and extraction in this region; active coal mines; and natural gas seeps. Researchers from CIRES, NOAA's Earth Systems Research Laboratory and Michigan are conducting a field campaign called TOPDOWN (Twin Otter Projects Defining Oil Well and Natural gas emissions) 2015, bringing airborne and ground-based instruments to investigate possible sources of the methane hot spot. Shiprock, New Mexico, is in the Four Corners region where an atmospheric methane \"hot spot\" can be seen from space. Researchers are currently in the area, trying to uncover the reasons for the hot spot. The JPL team will join the effort on April 17 and fly two complementary remote sensing instruments on two Twin Otter research aircraft. The Next-Generation Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRISng), which observes spectra of reflected sunlight, flies at a higher altitude and will be used to map methane at fine resolution over the entire region. Using this information and ground measurements from the other research teams, the Hyperspectral Thermal Emission Spectrometer (HyTES) will fly over suspected methane sources, making additional, highly sensitive measurements of methane. Depending on its flight altitude, the NASA aircraft can image methane features with a spatial resolution better than three feet (one meter) square. In other words, it can create a mosaic showing how methane levels vary every few feet, enabling the identification of individual sources. Hotspot of total column methane anomalies centered over the Four Corners region from 2003 to 2009, when a satellite-based methane-measuring instrument was operational. The April study will focus on verifying the hotspot and determining the methane sources producing the exceptionally elevated methane concentrations. With the combined resources, the investigators hope to quantify the region's overall methane emissions and pinpoint contributions from different sources. They will track changes over the course of the month-long effort and study how meteorology transports emissions through the region. 'If we can verify the methane detected by the satellite and identify its sources, decision-makers will have critical information for any actions they are considering,' said CIRES scientist Gabrielle P\u00e9tron, one of the mission's investigators. Part of President Obama's recent Climate Action Plan calls for reductions in methane emissions. The research team also includes scientists from the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research at the University of Colorado, Boulder; the U.S. Bureau of Land Management; and the state of New Mexico. Is this the cause? The Four Corners coal-fired power plant, near Farmington, is one of the targets Nasa wants to investigate as a possible cause of the methane . In each of the seven years studied from 2003-2009, the area released about 0.59 million metric tons of methane into the atmosphere. This is almost 3.5 times the estimate for the same area in the European Union's widely used Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research. In the study published online today in the journal Geophysical Research Letters, researchers used observations made by the European Space Agency's Scanning Imaging Absorption Spectrometer for Atmospheric Chartography (SCIAMACHY) instrument, which measured greenhouse gases from 2002 to 2012. The atmospheric hot spot persisted throughout the study period. A ground station in the Total Carbon Column Observing Network, operated by the Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory, provided independent validation of the measurement. To calculate the emissions rate that would be required to produce the observed concentration of methane in the air, the authors performed high-resolution regional simulations using a chemical transport model, which simulates how weather moves and changes airborne chemical compounds. Research scientist Christian Frankenberg of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, first noticed the Four Corners signal years ago in SCIAMACHY data. 'We didn't focus on it because we weren't sure if it was a true signal or an instrument error,' Frankenberg said. The study's lead author, Eric Kort of the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, noted the study period predates the widespread use of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, near the hot spot. This indicates the methane emissions should not be attributed to fracking but instead to leaks in natural gas production and processing equipment in New Mexico's San Juan Basin, which is the most active coalbed methane production area in the country. Natural gas is 95-98 percent methane. Methane is colorless and odorless, making leaks hard to detect without scientific instruments. 'The results are indicative that emissions from established fossil fuel harvesting techniques are greater than inventoried,' Kort said. 'There's been so much attention on high-volume hydraulic fracturing, but we need to consider the industry as a whole.' In just one place in the United States do four states meet. The borders of Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arizona intersect at Four Corners, west of the confluence of the Mancos and San Juan Rivers. Coalbed methane is gas that lines pores and cracks within coal. In underground coal mines, it is a deadly hazard that causes fatal explosions almost every year as it seeps out of the rock. After the U.S. energy crisis of the 1970s, techniques were invented to extract the methane from the coal and use it for fuel. By 2012, coalbed methane supplied about 8 percent of all natural gas in the United States. Frankenberg noted that the study demonstrates the unique role space-based measurements can play in monitoring greenhouse gases. 'Satellite data cannot be as accurate as ground-based estimates, but from space, there are no hiding places,' Frankenberg said. In March 2014 the Obama Administration announced a strategy to reduce methane emissions under its Climate Action Plan. The strategy includes improving the measurement and monitoring of methane emissions and assessing current methane emissions data.\n"]}

Since campaigning group GetUp launched The Gender Price Gap website last week, members and everyday consumers have identified nine separate products that have identical female versions which cost more. Bonds has been identified as one of the main culprits, advertising a button-up shirt, that comes in both 'summer blue' and 'blue denim' colour options, on their Australian website for $59.95. GetUp's new website,\u00a0The Gender Price Gap, has exposed nine everyday items that cost more for women . This is despite the products being identical in almost every way except whether they are targeted towards women or men . However, the exact same shirt advertised under the men's clothing section is advertised for only $49.95. Other examples highlighted on the website, which show increases from as little as 11c or even 1c for items marketed towards females, highlight the absurd and unexplained price difference even further. While some might argue that they don't mind paying an additional few cents now and again, GetUp's senior campaigner, Kelsey Cooke, told Daily Mail Australia that the costs accumulate significantly over a number of years. 'I don't mind paying an extra 60 cents for whatever item it might be that I like, but when you think about it in terms of weekly and yearly costs, it's hundreds or even thousands of dollars more than my partner would be paying - even if we had the same shopping list,' Ms Cooke said. Other examples highlighted on the website, which show price increases by as little as 11c or even 1c for items marketed towards females, highlight the absurd and unexplained price difference even further . Kinder Surprise chocolate eggs, for instance, which were advertised on Coles' website for $2.20, have a pink packaged 'girls' version for $2.30. Meanwhile a packet of five Gillette disposable razors for women was photographed costing $4.50 at a supermarket while the men's version, a packet of 10 disposables identical in everything but colour, cost $8.91. The reason for the 1c price difference per razor remains a mystery. When asked why companies would charge women more for the same items, Ms Cooke said there were two answers that GetUp had considered. While some might argue that they don't mind paying an additional few cents now and again, GetUp 's senior campaigner, Kelsey Cooke, told Daily Mail Australia that the costs accumulate significantly over the years . A children's mechanic set, sold by the same company, differs greatly in price. But is there really a difference? 'One is the idea that men's products are thought of as the standard product - the neutral or base product - but the women's version is usually a \"special\" version or a side product. It all comes down to a theory being debated, that women are considered \"the other\" and different, and thus it being OK to charge a premium for the product even if it's no different,' she said. 'The other reason is that they're probably just able to get away with it. I'm not privy to the conversations going on in these organisations, so I'm not sure, but I dare say that if they can find a way to make a profit on women's products by making them cost more, then they'll probably continue doing it.' Ms Cooke said that GetUp launched the website due to its interest in protesting against the gender pay gap, while drawing inspiration from similar campaigns being launched overseas. 'We know that the gender pay gap is growing at the moment and that it's only getting worse - right now it's at 18.8 per cent, and there's also a big superannuation gap so it's been on our members' minds for quite some time. We've also been hearing more examples about the cultural pressures for women to buy more products,' Ms Cooke said. Ms Cooke said that GetUp launched the website due to its interest in protesting against the gender pay gap, while drawing inspiration from similar campaigns being launched overseas .

The Gender Price Gap website aims to engage Australian women in the global conversation that is taking place around the 'pink tax' and encourage them to share their own experiences of the 'price gap' while seeing whether it's something they are interested in campaigning about. Ms Cooke warned that price differences were not always obvious due to items for different genders being held in different isles or floors, adding: 'it only becomes visible when you pay attention to it'.

But behind the scenes,\u00a0senior\u00a0party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the\u00a0thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. Nick Clegg today continued his tour of 60 seats where the party is defending perilous majorities or hope to make gains, stopping off in Eastleigh in Hampshire . Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats. Instead of battling to win seats across the country, the party has highly targeted strategy, effectively fighting 60 by-elections in constituencies where his candidates stand a chance. A party source said if the party had a group of MPs numbering 'in the 30s' it could potentially hold the balance of power after May 7 and be able to once again form part of a coalition government. The senior Lib Dem, closely involved in the party's election strategy, said the campaign's focus was increasingly on between 10 and 15 marginal seats - some held by the party and a few targets - with other constituencies either assessed as safe or effectively written off. Assessing the election outcome, the source said: 'Everything is so marginal, we need to get into the 30s and the other parties need to sort themselves out and we will see what the answer is. 'There are now basically two possible outcomes to this election - we can either get a minority government or a coalition with the Lib Dems in it.' Asked if a seat count in the 30s was realistic, the source said: 'Oh yes.' Pressed on whether that was a 'best case' scenario, the senior Lib Dem said: 'I would like to say 150, but I think in fairness you wouldn't believe me. 'There are lots of marginal seats. There's a marginal outcome in 40 seats for us and if we won every one of those marginal contests we would get to 40-odd.' Mr Clegg today admitted that his party was fighting 'tooth and nail' in fewer than a tenth of Westminster seats . Opinion polls by YouGov since 2010 show the dramatic collapse in the Lib Dem support, \u00a0to barely 8 per cent . The Lib Dems won 57 seats in the 2010 election but have been hit by a slump in popularity after forming the coalition government with the Conservatives. Mr Clegg travelled to Eastleigh, the scene of a 2013 by-election triumph, to spell out the intensity with which the party would fight in its target seats. The Lib Dems have built up a reputation as formidable campaigners in by-election contests, including in the Hampshire seat which they held following the resignation of disgraced former cabinet minister Chris Huhne, despite a Ukip surge. Mr Clegg and the party's election strategists have insisted the poor national opinion poll ratings, which have seen the party stuck around the 8 per cent mark, are not reflected in the data gathered by canvassers and internal polling. The Lib Dem leader told supporters: 'What we are going to do on May 7 isn't just, as the placards say, win here, we are going to win up and down the country. 'Because in effect what we are doing is running a campaign of not just one Eastleigh by-election but 60 Eastleigh by-elections - north, south, east, west, campaigning with exactly the same vigour that led to that famous victory.' He added: 'In the final week of this campaign two million voters will hear our message on Facebook, on YouTube and on social media. 'So we are fighting a campaign like we have never fought a campaign before. Sixty by-elections up and down the country.' Mr Clegg was all smiles at the Ageas Bowl cricket ground near Eastleigh, behind the scenes, senior party sources admit their current total of 57 MPs will be slashed to 'in the thirties' after a catastrophic collapse in support. The alternatives to a coalition involving the Lib Dems were a Labour-SNP alliance 'saddling our children with the dead weight of debts from this generation' or a 'hapless David Cameron administration dancing to the tune of Ukip, the DUP and - most chillingly and worryingly of all - his own MPs on the right wing of the Conservative Party'. In a rallying cry delivered at Hampshire County Cricket Club's Ageas Bowl stadium he said: 'If you don't want to run the risk of our country lurching to the right, lurching to the left, the only way to guarantee to keep our country on track is to vote Liberal Democrat. 'We will cut less than the Conservatives, we will borrow less than Labour. We have provided a heart to a government with the Conservatives, just as we would provide a brain to a government with the Labour Party on the economy.' He added: 'We will win again. We will campaign like no other party knows how to campaign again. We will serve our local community better than any other party does again. We will speak to more voters than any other party again.' Asked whether he was now even running a national campaign following his call for '60 Eastleighs', Mr Clegg said: 'I am saying that exactly the same zeal of that by-election is what we are applying in the 60-odd seats where we are fighting tooth and nail to get Liberal Democrats elected in this election.' A new\u00a0survey by Lord Ashcroft had the Tories on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent . The Tories could be six points ahead of Labour, or three points behind, depending on which opinion poll to believe. The latest batch of surveys agree on only one thing: the result is probably too close to call. David Cameron's day will have been brightened by a six-point lead in a survey by Lord Ashcroft. The Tories are on 36 per cent, with Labour trailing on 30 per cent, Ukip on 11 per cent and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Another poll by ICM for the Guardian also gave Mr Cameron's party a lead, but of only three points lead on 35 per cent to 32 per cent for Labour. However, the Sun's YouGov poll had Labour in the lead on 34 per cent to the Tories'\u00a033 per cent, indicating that the battle for No 10 remains agonisingly close for the party leaders. Labour enjoyed a three-point lead in a Populus poll, on 36 per cent (up one point) to the Conservatives' 33 per cent (up one). North of the border, a TNS poll found Scottish National Party support continuing to surge to 54 per cent, almost two-and-a-half times Labour's 22 per cent.\n"]}

The pair's workshop, aptly named the Masterclass Of Wellness: The Boardroom Retreat, is a way for executives and their staff to learn a set of skills that will help them every day. 1. Create good habits that support you: Make sure you always have a 'reward' built in to the habit for example when you go for a run allow yourself to walk the final few blocks home, or grab a coffee. 2. Reset throughout the day: As a stress reset try and take three deep breaths feeling your belly move rather than your chest. Do this as often as possible so you're building on an accumulative practice. 3.Use your phone as a form of healthcare: Have your key values programmed into your phone to pop up each morning and let these guide your decisions. 4. Set small sustainable habits:\u00a0It's the small things you do that have the biggest impact.\u00a0Look at something you already do and how can you make that into a habit. For example using your commuting time\u00a0effectively\u00a0by\u00a0listening to an audiobook. 5. Set technology boundaries: Switch off at least an hour before you go to bed at night, and don't check work emails until you're at your desk and able to deal with them. It takes attendees through a number of self-reflective activities, asking them to identify their key values and areas where they would like to improve. Four mediation sessions are spread throughout the workshops,which are filled with facts such as 80 per cent of thoughts can be negative, and 98 per cent may be the same as the previous day. 'One in six staff members now suffer from a form of mental illness, whether it be stress, anxiety, depression or suicide,' Shannah revealed. 'People don\u2019t go and have a day off because they have the flu, they actually need a mental health day.' Through their courses they work with executives and staff from organisations such as NAB, Macquarie Bank, PwC, kikki,K, Sportsgirl, Commonwealth Bank, Hewlett Packard and Mercedes Benz to help individuals and business be the most effective they can be.

'I've found in a lot of corporates that\u2019s shifting a little bit, because the consequence is too expensive for them' Shannah revealed. 'When their staff blow up and their staff do get depressed and are away the cost of replacing them is too much,' she added. Through their courses the pair teach different strategies and activities that can be implemented into daily life which stop staff 'burning out'. Decades of experience: Shannah (left) has been a life coach for 15 years, while Lyndall (right) started her career in a wellness retreat . Crash and burn: Lyndall and Shannah help CEOs and executives avoid career burnouts and balance all elements of their lives . 'There\u2019s all these different trains of thought in our mind, which train are you on?' Lyndall, who started working at a health retreat 22 years ago, said. 'Knowing that we have a choice because 80 percent of our thoughts can be negative, and 98 per cent can be the same as yesterday. 'We have 60,000-80,000 thoughts a day so that\u2019s a lot of activity, so if you imagine you\u2019re standing at a train station, that\u2019s a lot of activity going on,' she continued. Practices such as meditation and even simple reminders of priorities are taught to help people stay on top of their game. Shannah knows only too well the toll a demanding career can have on one's health and wellbeing, and the implications of it crashing down around you. 'I studied coaching after having chronic fatigue after a total burnout in the corporate world,' she revealed. '(I) Studied coaching, coached athletes into retirement and then turned corporate, so I now coach CEOs, state managers, business owners and have done so for a long time, Shannah added. Creating good habits: The pair share a number of key tips which help staff take control of their lives and be the best version of themselves . Thelma and Louise: Shannah and Lyndall liken themselves to the duo from the 1991 film . Whereas Lyndall's background is 'looking after type A achievers like Shannah'. 'I grew up in a remote part of Queensland and ended up working at Camp Eden health retreat, which was two doors away from my family home. 'That cemented my passion for wellness so helping people overcome self-destructive behaviours, so alcohol addiction, drug addiction. 'But then I decided retreat experiences are fantastic but how do you integrate this back into the real world?,' Lyndall said. It was around this time that the women met in a park while out with their kids, and decided to combine their knowledge to make it accessible for a wider audience. Busy lives:\u00a0As well as travelling teaching their masterclass, Lyndall (left) runs Aurora Spas and a training college, while Shannah (right) life coaches high profile athletes such as Brett Lee, but say they 'don't do stress' As well as travelling teaching their masterclass, Lyndall runs Aurora Spas and a training college, while Shannah life coaches high profile athletes such as Brett Lee, and executives such as the director of PwC, Cade Brow. 'We've got the busiest lives you've ever seen, but we don\u2019t do stress,' Shannah said. 'It\u2019s just having the right skill set to support yourself'. Some of the women's other high profile clients include former Olympian Benita Willis, Founder and Creative Director of kikki.K\u00a0Kristina Karlsson, and media personality Deborah Hutton. They also work with executives at Macquarie Bank and NAB - who they are about to embark on a national tour with, working with staff across all levels over the coming weeks. When it comes down to it, Shannah and Lyndall say they simply help people to be the 'best version of themselves'. 'It's about putting you back as the main priority,' Lyndall said.\n"]}

Stars Ray Liotta, Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and Paul Sorvino were all in attendance although director Scorsese was filming in Taiwan and Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in 1991 for his turn as Tommy DeVito, didn't show. 'Joe Pesci couldn't be here, but he sent this email: 'F***, f***, f***, f***ity f***, f***' read De Niro, introducing the screening at the Beacon Theatre. 'I'll translate: \"Dear Bob, sorry I can't be there. Love to all. Best, Joe.'\" Scroll down for video . The stars of Martin Scorsese's classic gangster film Goodfellas, Debi Mazar, Paul Sorvino, Robert De Niro, Ray Liotta and Lorraine Branco (from left to right) reunited in New York on Saturday night for a very special 25th anniversary screening of the movie which brought the 14th annual Tribeca Film Festival to a close . Released in 1990, Goodfellas charts the rise and fall of Lucchese crime family associate Henry Hill, played by Liotta, and his friends over a period from 1955 to 1980 . Scorsese and producer Irwin Winkler sent video messages to the audience. 'I remember the previews were one of the worst experiences of my life \u2014 we had three of them and they were all in California. ... It seemed that the audience had to be prepared for what it was, but there was a lot of controversy,' said the director. He went on to recall how he and screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi were no longer welcome at their favorite Italian restaurant after the movie - and its depiction of Italian-American mobsters - upset the owners. 'Remember that nice Italian restaurant in Tribeca that we used to go to? And then when the film came out, the owner of the restaurant said we're not allowed in anymore because we apparently denigrated a certain ethnic group for the picture?' said Scorsese. Throughout the two-and-a-half-hour screening the audience cheered each major character's first appearance along with iconic scenes like Karen Hill's doorbell-yelling session, and memorable lines like Henry Hill's opening narration: 'For as long as I can remember, I always wanted to be a gangster.' Afterwards, Liotta, Bracco, De Niro, Sorvino and Pileggi recalled making the beloved film in a panel discussion moderated by Daily Show host Jon Stewart. Actress Lorriane Bracco appeared in Goodfellas as Henry Hill's wife Karen before going on to star as Dr. Jennifer Melfi in The Sopranos . Paul Sorvino, right, who starred as mob boss Paul 'Paulie' Cicero in the movie, revealed during the Q&A that he had come close to quitting just days before filming as he failed to find the character . In the absense of Pesci, it was left to Liotta, who played mob informant Henry Hill, to recall how his co-star's famous 'Do I Amuse You' sequence was almost entirely improvised. 'Joe was just telling a story in rehearsal about something that happened to him in Queens,' said Liotta. 'Some guy, who happened to be a connected guy, said, \"You think that's funny?\" The scene helped snag Pesci his Best Supporting Actor Oscar. Liotta also recalled a bowling alley meeting with Hill, who told the actor he loved the movie. 'The first thing he said was thanks for not making me look like a s***bag,' said Liotta. 'I said, \"Did you see the movie?\" Sorvino, who starred as mob boss Paul 'Paulie' Cicero, then revealed that he had come close to quitting just days before filming. 'I was really lost, what do you do, I called my agent up and said, \"Get me out!,\" said the actor, who told the audiance that he is a 'soft guy' and nothing like his character. No show:\u00a0Joe Pesci, who won an Oscar for his turn as Tommy DeVito, didn't show for the 25th year anniversary but sent an email which read\u00a0'F***, f***, f***, f***ity f***, f***', said De Niro . Twenty five years on: Ray Liotta and Lorriane Bracco starred as husband and wife Henry and Karen Hill in Martin Scorsese's gangster epic Goodfellas, left, and shared a drink at Saturday's reunion, right . Robert De Niro, who founded the Tribeca Film Festival, arrived at Saturday's screening with his wife Grace Hightower . 'Then I was going to fix my tie and I saw this guy (in the mirror),' he added, flashing a cold stare. 'And it scared the hell out of me. That's the guy!' Also in attendance were several actors who had minor roles in the movie including Kevin Corrigan and Debi Mazar, who played Sandy, a friend of Henry Hill's mistress. Earlier on the red carpet, Liotta had recalled something Scorsese told him before filming began that made him believe he was going to be part of something special. 'He said, 'I want to shoot this like a gangster,'' said Liotta. '''If I want to freeze frame, if I want to voice over, if I want to whatever ...\" And that's what he did. It gave him a lot liberty to just be him.' That mindset paid off. Many regard the Oscar-nominated mob tale as more than just a great film of the genre, but also one of the greatest movies of all time. Scorsese used a compelling narrative with strong visuals married by a powerful rock soundtrack to reinvent the gangster film. 'I don't know if he reinvented it as much as he just created his own version of it,' Liotta said. Sorvino, who portrayed Paulie the mob capo that takes Liotta's Henry under his wing, thinks Scorsese went beyond reinventing the genre. 'It's not even part of a genre; it's like tearing off that wall and taking a look inside to see what it really is,' Sorvino said of the gritty depiction of life as a mid-level mobster. Jon Stewart, far right, hosted a Q&A with the film's star during which Ray Liotta, far left, recalled meeting the real Henry Hill, who thanked him for 'not making me look like a s***bag' In attendance at Saturday's screening of Goodfellas were actors Paul Sorvino, Debi Mazar, Robert De Niro, Lorraine Bracco and Kevin Corrigan (from left to right) The 76-year-old actor expressed gratitude to have a part in the film. 'It's part of the iconography of American film,' Sorvino said. 'It's one of the three or four greatest movies ever made, and if you get to do that in your career, you're pretty lucky.' Based on the nonfiction best-seller Wiseguy written by Nicholas Pileggi, the story traces the life of Henry Hill \u2014 a mobster-turned-informant \u2014 from his childhood and life of petty crime to rise and fall in the underworld. The film also stars De Niro as James 'Jimmy The Gent' Conway. De Niro is one of the film festival's co-creators. 'The fact that he helped put it together right after 9/11 and bring Tribeca back as well as New York \u2014 that was just honorable in itself. And to sustain it for so long now, it represents a great thing in movies, that's great for movies, and a great thing for the city,' Liotta said. De Niro, Jane Rosenthal and Craig Hatkoff founded the Tribeca Film Festival in 2002 as a means of stimulating the lower Manhattan neighborhood after the Sepember 11 attacks. But Lorraine Bracco, who played Henry's wife, Karen, thinks the festival did more than revitalize the city. 'It's for the world to see that we're still standing strong,' Bracco said. Saturday's screening of Goodfellas, staring Ray Liotta, marked the end of the 14th annual Tribeca Film Festival .\n"]}

The 'crystal clear' footage - said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain - was handed into the Metropolitan Police by a worker based 50ft from the crime scene. The worker had reportedly contacted 101 - the police non-emergency number - on Monday last week, believing detectives would already have similar images of the \u00a360m raid. Scroll down for video . Detectives investigating the Hatton Garden gem heist missed the most crucial CCTV footage so far until it was flagged up by a shocked worker more than one week later, it is claimed . But, even though police raced to obtain the CCTV once the report was made, the force has refused to make the images public \u2013 despite claims it is the best footage yet. It comes after the force was criticised  for ignoring an alarm that went off just after midnight on Good Friday - four days before the raid was discovered. A veteran trader in the London \u00adjewellery quarter told The Sunday Mirror: 'It is unreal it took this employee to bring these images to the attention of the police. The \u00adfootage could be crucial in collaring the crooks. 'You would assume the officers had done everything to get CCTV footage.' Scotland Yard has already come under fire for its handling of the heist, with the ex-head of the Flying Squad John O\u2019Connor criticising the decision to ignore the alarm as 'totally incompetent'. The Southern Monitoring Alarm Company had contacted the Metropolitan Police\u2019s Central Communications Command after the robbers set off the alarm  on Good Friday. But although police recorded the call, it was graded so that \u2018no police response was deemed to be required\u2019. It was not until Tuesday morning that detectives realised what had happened. When asked why the new footage had not been released, a police spokesman said the force would not discuss 'specifics' of CCTV being examined and would release appropriate footage when needed for a public appeal. The 'crystal clear' footage is said to be of a significantly higher quality than the video currently in the public domain, which was released last week (pictured) Last week, questioned were raised over the police's handling of the case after CCTV footage showing the robbers at work was published in The Daily Mirror - 21 hours before they were released by Scotland Yard . They said: 'The Metropolitan Police has \u00adobtained and is examining a substantial amount of CCTV footage in relation to the burglary at Hatton Garden Safe Deposit. 'This footage has come from many different places. We will not discuss the specifics of the CCTV we are examining and will release information in a timely manner for appeal purposes only. 'Police continue to seize CCTV with assistance from members of the public as the investigation progresses.' Last week, questioned were raised over the police's handling of the case after CCTV footage showing the robbers at work was published in The Daily Mirror, 21 hours before they were released by Scotland Yard. Mahendra Bavishi, joint director of the safe deposit company, said he was furious at police for ignoring an alarm which went off just on Good Friday . The tabloid claims it handed the images to police, who were 'delighted' with the find. One source said the footage 'blows the case wide open'. But detectives later insisted they already had the CCTV footage, which they claim was recovered 'at the earliest opportunity'. Hours earlier, police had refused to tell MailOnline whether they had the footage. The furore raised questions about why the police chose to keep the footage to themselves - or whether they even had the footage - despite it being one of the largest ever burglaries in the capital. But officers from Scotland Yard's Flying Squad did release images of three suspects. They refused to release a picture of the supposed ringleader, likely because he has already been identified. Earlier this week, Mahendra Bavishi, the joint director of the safe deposit company robbed in the raid, said  he believed it was an inside job. Mr Bavishi, who lives in Sudan, said detectives had asked to put some \u2018sensitive\u2019 questions to his British-based son Manish who runs the business - including whether he suspects someone connected to the company or other firms in the same premises had links with criminal gangs. He added that the robbers almost certainly had some inside information because they appeared to know that several CCTV cameras in the building where his firm is based were not working when they broke in. The 69-year-old also told of his fury at police for ignoring the alert from the state of the art alarm in the vault while the gang were carrying out the raid. The incident took place over the Easter weekend, when the gang forced their way into 72 safe deposit boxes by sneaking into the block, abseiling down a lift shaft to the underground vault and drilling through a 7ft-thick concrete wall. It is estimated that anything from \u00a360million to \u00a3200million of jewellery and cash was removed from the company\u2019s vaults in London\u2019s diamond district. Meanwhile, police are investigating links between the Hatton Garden incident and a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin. In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the \u00a360m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The gang, who fled the bank with diamonds, gold and silver worth more than \u00a38.3m, have never been found. It now appears that the Berlin heist bore all the hallmarks of the Easter weekend raid in London, including the use of a heavy-duty drill to bore through concrete walls, and the belief that the well-planned burglary was carried out with the help of an insider. German detectives are now keen to find out whether any DNA was recovered from the scene of the Easter weekend raid and whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in the robbery.\n"]}

The research claims that natural variability in surface temperatures over the course of a decade can account for increases and dips in warming rates. But it adds that these so-called 'climate wiggles' could also, in the future, cause our planet to warm up much faster than anticipated. Scroll down for video . The study compared its results to the most severe emissions scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).\u00a0Projected temperature change from 2081-2100 by the IPCC are pictured here. The latest study, however, says this climate model may be wrong . The study compared its results to the most severe emissions scenarios outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 'Based on our analysis, a middle-of-the-road warming scenario is more likely, at least for now,' said Patrick Brown, a doctoral student in climatology at Duke University. 'But this could change.' The Duke-led study says that variability is caused by interactions between the ocean and atmosphere, and other natural factors. They claim these 'wiggles' can slow or speed the rate of warming from decade to decade, and exaggerate or offset the effects of increases in greenhouse gas concentrations. If not properly explained and accounted for, they may skew the reliability of climate models and lead to over-interpretation of short-term temperature trends. Summary of projected changes in crop yields in a previous IPCC report. Because 'climate wiggles' were not accounted for, the Duke University researchers say the report may have been an over-interpretation of short-term temperature trends . The research, uses observed data, rather than the more commonly used climate models, to estimate decade-to-decade variability. 'At any given time, we could start warming at a faster rate if greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere increase without any offsetting changes in aerosol concentrations or natural variability,' said Wenhong Li, assistant professor of climate at Duke, who conducted the study with Brown. Infectious diseases, such as Ebola and West Nile virus, will rapidly spread to new areas as a result of global warming. This is according to zoologist, Professor Daniel Brooks, who warns humans can expect to face new illnesses as climate change brings crops, livestock, and humans into contact with pathogens. Professor Brooks says it will be 'the death of a thousand cuts' with society unable to keep up with the speed of disease as it spreads around the world. 'It's not that there's going to be one \"Andromeda Strain\" that will wipe everybody out on the planet,' Professor Brooks said, referring to the 1971 science fiction film about a deadly pathogen. 'There are going to be a lot of localised outbreaks that put a lot of pressure on our medical and veterinary health systems.' In his research, Professor Brooks has focused primarily on parasites in the tropics, while his colleague, Professor Eric Hoberg, has worked in Arctic regions. Each has observed the arrival of species that hadn't previously lived in that area and the departure of others, said Professor Brooks, who is affiliated with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The team examined whether climate models, such as those used by the IPCC, accurately account for natural chaotic variability that can occur in the rate of global warming. To test these, created a new statistical model based on reconstructed empirical records of surface temperatures over the last 1,000 years. 'By comparing our model against theirs, we found that climate models largely get the 'big picture' right but seem to underestimate the magnitude of natural decade-to-decade climate wiggles,' Brown said. 'Our model shows these wiggles can be big enough that they could have accounted for a reasonable portion of the accelerated warming we experienced from 1975 to 2000, as well as the reduced rate in warming that occurred from 2002 to 2013.' 'Statistically, it's pretty unlikely that an 11-year hiatus in warming, like the one we saw at the start of this century, would occur if the underlying human-caused warming was progressing at a rate as fast as the most severe IPCC projections,' Brown said. 'Hiatus periods of 11 years or longer are more likely to occur under a middle-of-the-road scenario.' Under the IPCC's middle-of-the-road scenario, there was a 70 per cent likelihood that at least one hiatus lasting 11 years or longer would occur between 1993 and 2050, Brown said. 'That matches up well with what we're seeing.' There's no guarantee, however, that this rate of warming will remain steady in coming years, Li stressed. 'Our analysis clearly shows that we shouldn't expect the observed rates of warming to be constant. They can and do change.' The IPCC has previously warmed that global warming is impacting 'all continents and across the oceans'. This map details some of the predicted affects of climate change in different continents. However the latest study claims that the worst-case scenario is unlikely to take place .\n"]}

So why are Arsenal destined to sign off from another campaign celebrating a top-four finish and not a serious title challenge? Finish second they may well, but never have they entered the race for the top-flight crown. This term they are simply the best of the ragged rest, each with their flaws which have made the title tussle something of a \u2018no contest\u2019. Arsenal celebrate after a fine strike from Alexis Sanchez put them 3-0 up against Liverpool on Saturday . This is the most impressive team the Gunners have boasted since the dying embers of the Invincibles side of more than a decade ago. They have pace, power, energy and invention in attack \u2013 and that is just Alexis Sanchez. At the other end they have hit upon an understanding which has seen them not concede more than once in the league since New Year\u2019s Day. But their failure to marry all of those components over the course of an entire campaign has cost them, again. This year, however, is a reverse of previous seasons. More recently we have built up Arsene Wenger\u2019s side as title challengers until the arrival of spring, only for it all to fall flat. Arsene Wenger watches on as his side cruise to a stylish win over their rivals for a top-four spot . This time, it is a stuttering start which has undermined their progress. By mid-October they had already dropped 13 points. There was talk of Wenger not even seeing the season out, let alone extending his stay into next term and beyond. But is the long-serving Frenchman finally about to hit upon a team which, given the manner in which they\u2019re finishing this campaign, could well be installed as title favourites come August? Should Wenger strengthen in key areas then they would surely be vying for such status at the head of the market. He needs no more Mesut Ozils, no more Santi Cazorlas or Tomas Rosickys. Rather, he needs a new spine and characters with backbone. Mesut Ozil celebrates his goal on Saturday as the German World Cup winner continued his fine form . A central defender, central midfielder and centre forward need to arrive if this current vintage is to avoid going the same way as those who have promised so much yet delivered so little in recent years. Interestingly, Wenger\u2019s policy of chasing the best British talent could be on the way out. Yes, there was the capture of Danny Welbeck last summer, but that was more opportunistic than a long-term pursuit. Welbeck, in turn, has netted just four league goals and watched from the bench as Liverpool were torn apart. So, too, did Theo Walcott. He has the mitigation of injury, of course, but does Wenger trust him to remain fit for an entire campaign? Likewise, Jack Wilshere. Teams which win titles have players who, in short, play. Jack Wilshere (centre) watches on from the stands on Saturday after missing out through injury . Theo Walcott (left) has struggled since returning from a year-long injury lay-off . Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey have both started just 17 of 31 league games. For the latter, a return of four goals is a sorry show given the 16 he plundered last season. So while there is the promise of better times ahead, issues remain for Wenger to sort. You feel he is finally on the cusp of something exciting at the Emirates. But then we have been there before and it ultimately ends in the celebration of failure. Wenger needs to think big this summer, or else goodwill from frustrated fans could be in short supply.\n"]}

The Gloucester No 8 has not played since breaking his left leg during an Aviva Premiership game against Saracens in early January. But the signs suggest he is on course to play a part during England's World Cup warm-up period ahead of the tournament kicking off in mid-September. Ben Morgan is hopeful of featuring for England at the forthcoming World Cup despite his long-term injury . Morgan last featured for England when he scored two tries during their victory over Australia five months ago. Injury then struck, and he missed the entire RBS 6 Nations campaign as a result. The 26-year-old, though, remains an integral part of England boss Stuart Lancaster's World Cup plans, and the current prognosis is a good one after Morgan recently underwent final surgery to remove a pin from his leg. 'To be honest, I have not found this difficult at all,' said 27 times-capped Morgan, after watching his Gloucester colleagues continue their preparations for Friday night's European Challenge Cup final against Edinburgh. 'I am really positive and using this as a great experience to make myself better for when I come back. Who else gets six months off to rest up and train hard? 'Yes, I will be at a disadvantage in terms of the fact I haven't played any rugby. 'But looking at the World Cup in particular, there will be lads who wouldn't have played for probably two and a bit months going into the first (warm-up) game, so everyone is going to be on an equal playing field.

Gloucester No 8 Morgan broke his left leg playing against Saracens in the Aviva Premiership in January . 'I have a lot of strengthening to do around my legs - in the early stages you don't want to rush that. When things strengthen up, that's when I can start chucking some serious tin around. 'I had an operation last week. It is a case of seeing if things affect my ankle, and if they don't, then I can do them again. 'It is very reactive. I just have to take it day by day. It could be a couple of weeks down the line or a couple of months down the line when I run again, but there is no point rushing this sort of thing.' Lancaster is due to name a 45-man World Cup training squad next month, followed by his final 31-man group for the tournament in late August. England's World Cup preparations, meanwhile, also feature home and away games against France in August, plus a September appointment with reigning Six Nations champions Ireland at Twickenham. Morgan last played for England during his side's victory against the Wallabies at Twickenham in November . Reflecting on the injury, Morgan added: 'It was tough, but it was one of those things. It happens - deal with it. 'If I start thinking about what I missed out on, I'm just going to become negative. I have this mindset going forward about living the law of attraction. 'It is basically positivity breeds positivity. If you get that positive mindset, you attract everything into your life that is positive. I'm thinking of this as a positive experience. 'I can get bigger, better, faster, stronger and improve myself as a player before I come back. I can use this to my advantage. Otherwise I could sit there and fester and get fat, lazy and never come back. 'I sat in the hospital and thought to myself 'okay, it's done. How long is it going to take me to get back?'' 'Ideally, I would like to be back playing in those warm-up games because that gives me a shot of getting in the squad. 'There are so many variables about what can happen, though.

Instead of going to work in an office, the Brisbane gamer known only as Bonnie Doll starts up her Xbox and goes on a killing spree with followers of her live stream. Originally from Sweden, Bonnie has been living in Australia since 2007. Playing Call Of Duty with others has become such a financial success that she has been able to give up her job working in hospitality. Scroll down for video . Tome Raider: Bonnie Doll is Australia's answer to Lara Croft in the gaming world . Followers of her live stream pay a subscription to join her online and also give donations . Bonnie used to work in hospitality, but once she started live streaming Call Of Duty there was no looking back . 'I got partnered with twitch.tv a few months after I started streaming.\u00a0I think I realised when I got enough funds from streaming I could pay the bills and have sufficient income to live comfortably,' Bonnie told Daily Mail Australia. 'I still sometimes have to pinch myself when I think that I can work from home playing video games and just interact with people.' Although the 28-year-old would not say exactly how much she now earned it was a good deal more than she got working in her previous job in the hospitality industry. 'Being partnered with twitch.tv means you get a percentage from your monthly subscribers and also ad revenue. Another big part is from donators (direct supporters of the stream),' she said.

Especially dresses,' she told Daily Mail Australia. 'I might not be going out to an actual work place and interact with people that way but being on a camera - where some days my channel might have over 10,000 channel clicks - I like to look and feel nice.

Unfortunately its everywhere online these days and you can\u2019t bring yourself down by listening to haters. 'I try to focus on the good audience in my streams, they are the ones that make me want to get up in the morning and do what I do.' Bonnie can play the game in the privacy of her own home and still earn some cash . The attractive Bonnie is constantly fending off the attentions of fanatical fans who ask her out on dates . Bonnie used to share a house with a friend who owned an Xbox and MW2 back in 2009 and started playing then. Since that day she hasn't looked back. 'When you first start playing and you start stacking up the score streaks and kills and feel better and better at the game - it's hard to stop.

While being beautiful, fit and healthy is expected, it's all about a demand for the 'influencer' now. Thanks to the proliferation of social media, in order for modelling agencies to keep up with client demand, 'influencer' and 'blogger' divisions are now being added to their traditional model portfolio. General manager of Vivien's Models Catherine McGill told Daily Mail Australia that they launched an 'influencers' section two months ago because of the growing need to accommodate client demand for social media numbers. Scroll down for video . Influencer: Gigi Hadid is one of many in-demand models whose social media following is as much a draw card as her good looks for clients booking her on jobs . Self-made model: Mimi Elashiry turned her social media following into a modelling career . Big on Instagram: Elashiry has almost 700,000 followers . 'Our bookers  were giving me feedback that clients wanted models who might be blonde, beachy and had a high social media following,' she said. 'Now when we\u2019re booking talent, in negotiation process, we talk about the girls numbers.' McGill says the average expectation of clients will range anywhere between 10,000 - 300,000 followers. 'It\u2019s not hard and fast number, but 10,000 is the minimum number clients are asking for,' she said. 'So if models are getting up to that, they might get added to our 'Influencer' page.' Joseph Tenni of Chadwick Models told News.com.au that 'It\u2019s not unusual for a client to ask \u201chow many followers does she have?\u201d before they ask what they look like.' Chic Management also started a 'blogger' management division two years ago. Of influencer: Prestigious model agency Vivien's has introduced an 'Influencer' page noting their models' social media stats . 'That line of just being a model is being blurred': Bloggers and influencers are now being snapped up by agencies capitalising on their following . General Manager Paul Thomas says it's now where all the money is being spent, with clients seeking hard and fast brand promotion. 'If you  think about it, your brand can send their product straight to someone's pocket rather than printing a catalogue in store and waiting for a customer go collect it.' Thomas told Daily Mail Australia it's all about the elusive 'cool girl' appeal. 'Influencers are like a captain of the ship - because there is so much information out there, people turn to models, fashion people and talent and begin liking what they are liking.' 'We do have clients that  book in a traditional sense, but new up-and-coming brands want a \u2018cool girl\u2019 with vast social numbers that they can book a campaign off the back of the model's social media,' he said. It's this combination of 'cool girl' meets followers and a 'lust-have' lifestyle that Thomas said is really drawing in clients, and models are now being trained how to self-promote on their Instagram to get work. International: American Alexis Ren has over 1.6million followers, and is in demand Down Under as much for her looks as her army of followers . 'Now that line of just being a model is being blurred, people want to know about the model but it's got to be organic, you can smell when it\u2019s all a bit too staged,' he said. Thomas said health and fitness is very 'on brand' at the moment, so that's something the girls are encouraged to promote, which most of them naturally will as they stay in shape. 'With new faces we sit down with them and do social media training, to make sure those girls are representing us as well. We don\u2019t need them to be serious posters, just once or twice a day, or one every day.' Chic manage American model Alexis Ren, who has over 1.6 million followers and has shot previous campaigns for Australian label General Pants. 'She has\u00a01.6 million followers, a  huge following in Australia, her boyfriend is this amazingly good looking surfie and her Instagram is a mood board that makes you want to be on holidays with them.' Thomas said it's a coup for Australian brands because she is not only 5\u20198, beautiful and blonde  but  she is 'insta-famous', has an increase of 45,000 followers per week and has a boyfriend with almost a million followers, so they have the tools they need to sell her as a talent. Chic Management also says bloggers like Sarah Donaldson from Harper and Harley and Brooke Testoni have scored major campaigns with Oral B and Pandora  based on their social outreach and style.\n"]}

And Wilson\u2019s strike was their 89th league goal of the season, moving clear of the previous record 88 they scored in the Division Three South in the 1956-57 season. Prior to the goals they had not looked like the typically fluent Bournemouth that has made them league leaders for the majority of the campaign. The passes were hit that little bit too long, the crosses went out for goal kicks and the through balls were slightly mistimed. Brighton\u2019s Leon Best got in behind their defence in the 58th minute and shaped to bend an effort into the right of goal but his shot was woeful, weak and straight at Artur Boruc.

{"question_id": 917, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: Women have long been warned that the older they are, the greater the risk of health problems for them and their baby - but research now suggests older fathers can also affect baby's health. This increases the risk of epilepsy, autism and breast cancer. Two-thirds of new UK fathers are now over 30, and the researchers say older would-be fathers should be better informed about the risks of conditions that can occur in their offspring. Whereas the menopause marks the end of reproduction, men are able to produce sperm throughout their lives. However, the quality declines and, according to the new research from doctors at the Centre for Reproductive Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Texas, and other centres, this could have implications for the next generation. Men are able to produce sperm throughout their lives. However, the quality declines and this could have implications for the next generation . Worldwide data from more than 60 teams of researchers on the health risks associated with older fathers found that men aged over 35 had a 50 per cent lower chance of conceiving over a 12-month period than men 25 and under, even after taking into account the age of the would-be mother. The risk of miscarriage and premature birth also rises when the man is more than 40. A study of 23,821 pregnant women analysed by the researchers found that pregnancies involving men aged 50 or older were twice as likely to end in the loss of the foetus compared to younger fathers. And the problems may not end with conception. Advanced paternal age (over 40) increases the risk of breast cancer in their daughters by around 60 per cent, according to one of the studies the American researchers looked at (one of five to find a link between advanced paternal age and breast cancer). Children conceived by fathers over 40 also have a 30 per cent increased risk of epilepsy, a 37 per cent higher risk of Down's syndrome, a 14 per cent greater chance of childhood leukaemia, and a 70 per cent greater likelihood of central nervous system cancers (such as brain tumours). If the father is over 45, there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer. Older fathers are thought to be at higher risk of having children with autism and schizophrenia. If the father is over 45, there is a threefold increased risk of retinoblastoma, a rare type of eye cancer . Some of the biggest increases in risk are seen in genetic disorders. Achondroplasia, a common cause of dwarfism, is nearly eight times more prevalent in the children of fathers aged 50 and over. So, why might this be? In order to produce new sperm, so-called sperm 'precursor' cells have to divide. They do this every 16 days, which means by the time a man reaches 70, these cells will have divided around 1,500 times. With each division comes a risk of DNA mutation and genetic defects. A study from Iceland in 2012 found that the average child born to a 20-year-old father has 25 DNA mutations in their genes and that the number increases annually, reaching 65 mutations for offspring of 40-year-old men, increasing the risk of problems. Another explanation is that, after the age of 60, a high percentage of sperm is affected by so-called DNA fragmentation. Normally, the genetic material in a sperm cell is wound up like a tight ball of yarn to prevent the strands of DNA breaking. When the genetic material is not safely packaged, the DNA strands are vulnerable to breakage, or DNA fragmentation, which means the fertilised egg may not be able to develop normally and, in some cases, become unviable. With age, a man's testosterone levels also drop, with one in five men over 60 having low levels, leading to poor semen quality, which can affect conception rates. Advanced paternal age can also lead to birth defects, say the Baylor researchers, whose study is being published in the journal Fertility and Sterility. Dr Simon Fishel, chief executive of CARE Fertility, says: 'Even though men keep producing sperm, the decline in sperm DNA with age is now uncontroversial, with potentially devastating effects on the offspring of older men. 'It is not as marked or obvious an effect that we observe in women, which makes it all the more insidious and risky for populations in which men are reproducing later in life. 'This study is telling us we need to sit up and take note, and start to educate the public on the risks of the male biological clock, and not just the female.' Women are generally counselled that as they reach their late-30s, their risk of not just conceiving, but of having a healthy child decreases as the quality and quantity of their eggs deteriorate. At 35, a woman's risk of conceiving a child with Down's syndrome is about one in 350, but by age 45, it is about one in 30. Yet currently, patients are rarely warned about how advanced paternal age may present risks to their offspring, but this should change, says Dr Dolores Lamb, director of the Centre for Reproductive Medicine and Professor of Urology and Molecular and Cellular Biology at Baylor College of Medicine. 'The medical community must do a better job of educating couples that there are some risks associated with conception at advanced paternal age,' she says. One issue will be identifying the age at which problems may occur. One study the researchers looked at, which set out to find a cut-off age for men, found that semen quality declined continuously with age, with no point at which risk suddenly increased.\n"]}

Now, researchers have shown that passive smoking affects plants too, which can take up nicotine from contaminated soil and plumes of smoke. The finding may explain why some spices, herbal teas and medicinal plants have high concentrations of nicotine in them, despite none being allowed in insecticides. Researchers have shown that passive smoking affects plants too, which can take up nicotine from contaminated soil and plumes of smoke (illustrated with a stock image) Nicotine was frequently used as an insecticide until it was banned by the European Union in 2009 because of its toxicity. But a surprisingly large number of food crops and plant-derived products still contain very high levels of nicotine. Dirk Selmar and his colleagues at the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany, set out to uncover whether there are reasons for this beyond the use of illegal insecticides. They used peppermint plants, which contain minimal traces of nicotine, in a series of mulching and fumigation experiments. He said: \u2018Tremendously elevated nicotine levels were detected after fumigation with cigarette smoke.\u2019 The researchers showed for the\u00a0that that peppermint plants (a stock image is shown) can take up high concentrations of nicotine from contaminated soils, as well as taking in the drug from smoke . Cats and dogs whose owners smoke are twice as likely to develop some types of cancer as those whose owners do not. Dogs that are exposed to tobacco smoke are much more likely to develop nose and lung cancers than dogs not exposed to smoke. Smaller pets and birds can also be affected as they are very sensitive to the effects of smoke. Previous research, by Tufts University, near Boston, US, also found that cats that live with smokers are twice as likely to develop Feline Lymphoma, a serious cancer of the blood and immune system. It is believed that when cats groom themselves they ingest contaminated dust, soot, ash and nicotine which was caught in their fur. They also showed for the first time that that peppermint plants can take up high concentrations of nicotine from contaminated soils. The team analysed plants in soil mulched with cigarette tobacco for more than nine days to find that the resulting nicotine concentrations in them were several times higher than the maximum residue level set by European authorities. The study, published in Springer\u2019s journal Agronomy for Sustainable Development, suggests that the reported high levels of this substance may indeed originate from tobacco. The researchers found a drastic decrease in nicotine concentration in plants as time progressed. This is likely because nicotine was taken up by the roots of the peppermint plants and processed in their leaves. \u2018Our results suggest that the widespread occurrence of nicotine in medicinal, spice and food plants may, at least in part, be due to other nicotine sources apart from the illegal use of insecticides,\u2019 Dr Selmar said. As well as being interesting to the food industry, the findings prove that substances such as alkaloids, can be transferred from one plant, after its death, to another. Such \u2018horizontal transfer of natural products\u2019 sheds light on the hitherto unexplained success behind farming practices such as crop rotation and the co-cultivation of certain vegetables.\n"]}

Kim Callaghan, 39, piled on the pounds after the birth of her two children, reaching a worrying  20st 3lb. However, the determined slimmer has now shrunk down to a slender 9st 10lb after taking up exercise and swapping starchy meals for smaller portions. Kim Callaghan became so worried that her weight was causing her to look like a man that she went on a dramatic diet that saw her lose half of her body weight . Kim's weight loss saw her drop an incredible ten dress sizes to slim down to a slinky size eight. Before she slimmed down Kim's wardrobe was limited to size 28 figure-hiding garments, and she was afraid she was losing her femininity. Kim who lives in Ardee, County Louth, Ireland, says she turned to masculine clothing as a way of hiding her shape. 'I only wore baggy trousers and flappy shirts when I was fat - I was trying to cover up my body because I was embarrassed. I stopped looking like a woman. 'Now I've slimmed down and I feel confident enough to wear dresses again. I feel healthy and very feminine.' Kim married her husband Sean Callaghan, 41, in 1999. After the pair got married they splashed out on a double deep-fat fryer. Kim piled on the pounds after giving birth to her two children, as she became heavier she worried that her husband Sean would not see her as the 'sexy' woman he married . Before her weight loss Kim was limited to a wardrobe of size 28 clothing she is now a slinky size 10 . The housewife's diet consisted mainly of convenience foods like chicken kiev, deep-fried chicken, potato croquettes and burgers. She said: 'We loved pizza, chips and chicken kievs. The deep fat fryer was my favourite thing in the house.' Soon after Kim gave birth to her children Owen, now 14, and Shannon, 13, and her weight gain accelerated. Eventually she tipped the scales at 20st 3lb and says that she found it increasingly difficult to find clothes to suit her. The turning point came for Kim when she struggled to keep up with her children she now takes part in regular exercise including cycling around her local area . Kim joined Slimming World in secret and lost a stone in her first three weeks . 'I tried to take pride in my appearance, but at that size it was impossible to find anything flattering, I ordered all my clothes from catalogues. 'Before long I had a wardrobe which could have been owned by a man. I had a signature cropped hairstyle and honestly looked nothing like a woman. I was worried that the the sexy, curvy bride which Sean had married had disappeared forever.' The turning point came for Kim when she was out with her children on St Patrick's Day in 2011. She had to stop and rest after struggling to keep up. She said: 'I was trying to follow the kids up a hill near our home. I was hot and sweaty and I had to stop to catch my breath. 'My weight was getting in the way of my life with my kids - I knew it was time to change. 'When I got home that night I found a Slimming World leaflet had been posted through my door. I thought it was a sign.' Kim started attending her local Slimming World classes in secret and was initially embarrassed to admit she was trying to lose weight. She said: 'It took all my courage to go to the meetings - I was convinced everyone would judge me. Kim feels far more feminine now that she is not limited to catalogue clothing . 'Three weeks later I'd shed a stone and I celebrated by telling my husband and the kids. They were all very supportive and amazed at what I had done.' In a bid to make a dramatic change she swapped greasy fried foods for healthy meals cooked from scratch. Kim even threw out her double deep-fat-fryer. The devoted slimmer also started running and cycling - and the pounds started to fall off. Soon she had slimmed down to the slinky 9st 10lb she is today and ditched her baggy unflattering clothes for good. She said: 'I love being able to go into shops and have everything fit me. I don't need to order from catalogues any more. 'I feel fantastic and I look great. I have a new life now.' Breakfast: Nothing . Lunch: Fry-up with four slices of buttered bread . Dinner: Chicken Kiev with potato croquettes and chips . Snacks: Crisps . Breakfast: Porridge with berries . Lunch: Scrambled eggs with ham and mushrooms . Dinner: Chicken stir-fry .

An Uber driver in San Francisco has been charged with assault after ramming into a cyclist who was shouting at him, leaving the biker with several broken bones, police and media reported. The incident occurred in the busy Fisherman's Wharf area of San Francisco when the cyclist rode up to the vehicle, yelled at the driver, banged on his window and pushed in his mirror, police spokesman Carlos Manfredi told AFP. 'During the exchange the cyclist sped up and the vehicle also sped up, striking the back of the bike,' Manfredi said. 'The cyclist sustained a punctured lung, broken ribs and a broken clavicle,' he added. The driver, Emerson Decarvalho, 38, stayed at the scene of the crash and was charged with assault with a deadly weapon after the incident, which took place Sunday afternoon. He was also charged with failing to maintain a three-foot (one meter) space between his car and the cyclist. Uber offered to help in the investigation of the incident. 'Our thoughts are with the victim of this terrible incident. We are gathering more information, have reached out to the San Francisco Police Department and will assist their investigation however we can,' said Uber spokeswoman Kate Downen. Uber said there was no passenger in the vehicle at the time. The San Francisco Chronicle newspaper said the cyclist was knocked unconscious and taken to hospital. Police said it was not clear what provoked the confrontation and said Decarvalho remained in custody. The crash occurred in San Francisco's famous Fishermans Warf area . Manfredi said the altercation took place in one of San Francisco's busiest neighborhoods. 'The location where it occurred is a highly dense area where people go out and a lot of tourists were out and about,' he said. Uber drivers must be 18 years old to join the service must agree to the company's terms and conditions, including agreeing to 'comply with all applicable laws when using the services.' The San Francisco company also requires that drivers do not 'cause nuisance, annoyance, inconvenience, or property damage.' About one million Uber trips are carried out daily in 295 cities in 55 countries. The company announced a worldwide code of conduct this year after an Uber driver was charged with rape in India in December. An Uber driver was arrested in Denver this month after he tried to rob the home of a customer he had dropped off at the airport.\n"]}

Many Christian schools give priority to families who regularly attend services, a practice which they say preserves their faith ethos - but a group of vicars say it can lead to discrimination against the poor . But the clergymen said affluent parents were more likely to cheat the system by going to church just to get their children into a C of E school, which are often high-performing. In an open letter published yesterday, an alliance of Left-leaning clergy and laypeople called for an end to religious selection. They claimed the Church was being \u2018turned to the advantage of those who are already advantaged\u2019, and said it presented a \u2018slow-burning crisis\u2019. The comments, made in a letter to The Guardian, sparked anger from the Church of England, which labelled their arguments \u2018doctrinaire\u2019.

Referring to a 2013 survey by the Sutton Trust, they said 6 per cent of parents with a child at a state-funded school admitted to attending church services in order to get their child into a Church school. They said the level of false Church attendance rose to 10 per cent among affluent parents in the socio-economic group A. The letter said: \u2018On a superficial level this is in the Church\u2019s interest, as attendance figures in many parishes are inflated and the standard of our schools boosted by the admittance of children from more affluent families. \u2018Ultimately however the universality of the Church is being turned to the advantage of those who are already advantaged. We believe this issue presents a slow-burning crisis. \u2018We urge the Church to review and then amend its national guidance on pupil admissions, so that schools are guided towards having open admission arrangements. \u2018Church of England schools should look outwards, as an expression of the warmth and generosity of its mission to the whole community.\u2019 Yesterday, a Church spokesman said: \u2018The arguments set out in the letter are so flawed and inaccurate they need to be placed in special measures.

{"question_id": 924, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: While Google and Apple are developing self driving vehicles, Nasa has revealed its vision - and its a lot more fun. Called the Modular Robotic Vehicle, or MRV, it was developed at NASA's Johnson Space Center to show off the technologies that could let man move across other planets. On Earth, however, it also has some neat tricks - from the ability to park sideways to being able to spin on the spot, as well as being driven remotely at up to 70mph. Watch the buggy in action below . Unlike a normal car, the buggy has\u00a0no mechanical linkages to the propulsion, steering, or brake actuators, the driver of an MRV relies completely on control inputs being converted to electrical signals and then transmitted by wires to the vehicle's motors. A turn of the steering wheel, for instance, is recorded by sensors and sent to computers at the rear of the vehicle. These computers interpret that signal and instruct motors at one or all four of the wheels to move at the appropriate rate, causing the vehicle to turn as commanded. Nasa says the vehicles was buit 'in order to advance technologies that have applications for future vehicles both in space and on Earth.' 'With seating for two people, MRV is a fully electric vehicle well-suited for busy urban environments, it says. MRV is driven by four independent wheel modules called e-corners. Each e-corner consists of a redundant steering actuator, a passive trailing arm suspension, an in-wheel propulsion motor, and a motor-driven friction braking system. Each e-corner can be controlled independently and rotated \u00b1180 degrees about its axis. This allows for a suite of driving modes allowing MRV to maneuver unlike any traditional vehicle on the road. In addition to conventional front two wheel steering, the back wheels can also articulate allowing for turning radiuses as tight as zero. The driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction achieving an omni-directional, crab-like motion. This makes a maneuver such as parallel parking as easy as driving next to an available spot, stopping, and then operating sideways to slip directly in between two cars. 'This two-seater vehicle was designed to meet the growing challenges and demands of urban transportation,' said Mason Markee, also with Johnson. 'The MRV would be ideal for daily transportation in an urban environment with a designed top speed of 70 km/hr and range of 100 km of city driving on a single charge of the battery. 'The size and maneuverability of MRV gives it an advantage in navigating and parking in tight quarters.' With a designed top speed of around 70 km/hr, test driving proved to be a bit of fun. Justin Ridley told an Nasa magazine: 'It's like driving on ice but having complete control. 'It's a blast to ride in and even more fun to drive. We've talked about it being like an amusement park ride. 'The 'fun' of driving was not something we tried to design for, just something that came out of the design. 'Once we got it running many of us commented that we had no idea it was going to be able to do the things it does.' 'This work also allowed us to develop some technologies we felt were needed for our future rovers,' said Ridley. The driver controls MRV with a conventional looking steering wheel and accelerator/brake pedal assembly. The driving mode can be switched so that all four wheels point and move in the same direction - perfect for parallel parking. 'These include redundant by-wire systems, liquid cooling, motor technology, advanced vehicle control algorithms. 'We were able to learn a lot about these and other technologies by building this vehicle.' The buggy can also be controlled remotely, and in the future Nasa says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving. The driver controls MRV with a conventional looking steering wheel and accelerator/brake pedal assembly. Both of these interfaces were specially designed to mimic the feel of the mechanical/hydraulic systems that people are used to feeling when driving their own cars. The buggy can also be controlled remotely, and in the future Nasa says this system can be expanded to allow for autonomous driving. 'While the vehicle as a whole is designed around operating in an urban environment, the core technologies are advancements used in many of our robotic systems and rovers,' said Mason. 'Actuators, motor controllers, sensors, batteries, BMS, component cooling, sealing, and software are all examples of technologies that are being devel oped and tested in MRV that will be used in next generation rover systems. 'The technologies developed in MRV have direct application in future manned vehicles undertaking missions on the surface of Earth's moon, on Mars, or even an asteroid. 'Additionally, MRV provides a platform to learn lessons that could drive the next generation of automobiles.\n"]}

The group has put together a team of 'extraterrestrial experts' to see if any of the planets discovered outside our solar system are habitable. And it says that amateur astronomers could help with its 'unprecedented' search for ET by accessing research data online. Scroll down for video . The Nexss team, includes those who study Earth as a life-bearing planet (lower right), those researching the diversity of solar system planets (left), and those on the new frontier, discovering worlds orbiting other stars in the galaxy (upper right) The initiative, dubbed Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (Nexss), will include scientists from 10 universities including Stanford, the University of California and Yale. The study of exoplanets is a relatively new field, and began with the discovery of the first exoplanet around a star like our sun in 1995. Since the launch of the Kepler space telescope six years ago, more than 1,000 exoplanets have been found, with thousands of additional candidates waiting to be confirmed. Nasa has set up a website for the public called Planet Hunters which allows anyone to search the data gathered by Kepler, which launched six years ago. Scientists are also developing new ways to confirm the habitability of these worlds and search for biosignatures, or signs of life. During a talk last month, Nasa said humanity will encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' said Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, (pictured) at a Washington panel discussion . By applying a 'system science' approach, the team hopes to understand an alien planet's biology interacts with the atmosphere, geology, oceans, and interior of a planet. The announcement comes just weeks after Nasa's top scientist predicted we could be on the verge of finding life on one of them. During a talk in Washington last month, the space agency announced that humanity is likely to encounter extra-terrestrials within a decade. Alien hunters from the University of Berkeley, California and Stanford are tasked with answering the question: 'What are the properties of exoplanetary systems, as they relate to their formation, evolution, and potential to harbour life?' They will combine astronomical observations of exoplanets and forming planetary systems with powerful computer simulations and cutting-edge microscopic studies of meteorites. The team from Arizona State University in Phoenix will take a similar approach. This research group will place planetary habitability in a chemical context, with the goal of producing a 'periodic table of planets.' Researchers from Hampton University, Virginia, will be exploring the sources and sinks for volatiles on habitable worlds.\u00a0This research will help determine the past and present habitability of Mars and even Venus. The team centered at Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies will investigate habitability on a more local scale. It will examine the habitability of solar system rocky planets through time. The team from Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut,  will design new spectrometers - optical instruments that measure the spectrum of light - with the stability to reach Earth-detecting precision for nearby stars. A group led the University of Nebraska-Kearney will explore the existence and evolution of exospheres around exoplanets, the outer, 'unbound' portion of a planet's atmosphere. From the University of California, Santa Cruz, a group will investigate how novel maths equations can be used to extract information from light that is emitted and reflected by planetary atmospheres. 'I believe we are going to have strong indications of life beyond Earth in the next decade and definitive evidence in the next 10 to 20 years,' Ellen Stofan, chief scientist for Nasa, said. 'We know where to look, we know how to look, and in most cases we have the technology.' Jeffery Newmark, interim director of heliophysics at the agency, added: 'It's definitely not an if, it's a when.' 'We are not talking about little green men,' Stofan said. 'We are talking about little microbes.' The announcement was prompted by the recent discovery of water by Nasa in surprising places. Jim Green, director of planetary science at Nasa, noted that a recent study of the Martian atmosphere found 50 per cent of the planet's northern hemisphere once had oceans a mile deep. Scientists using the Hubble recently provided powerful evidence that Jupiter's moon Ganymede (pictured) has a saltwater, sub-surface ocean, likely sandwiched between two layers of ice . The same study found that water had been present on the red planet for up to 1.2 billion year. 'We think that long period of time is necessary for life to get more complex,' Stofan said. Nasa associate administrator John Grunsfeld\u00a0said he is excited about seeing what form life beyond Earth may take. In their hunt for alien life, astronomers have so far focused on looking for Earth-like planets around smaller, cooler suns. But these exoplanets - despite having a chance of holding water - are believed to be locked in a rotation around their sun which causes only one side of their surface face the star. Now astronomers claim that such exoplanets actually rotate around their stars, and spin at such a speed that they exhibit a day-night cycle similar to Earth \u2013 increasing the chance of finding alien life. Planets with potential oceans could have a climate that is much more similar to Earth's than previously expected,' said J\u00e9r\u00e9my Leconte, a postdoctoral fellow at the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics (CITA) at the University of Toronto. 'If we are correct, there is no permanent, cold night side on exoplanets causing water to remain trapped in a gigantic ice sheet,' he said. 'Whether this new understanding of exoplanets' climate increases the ability of these planets to develop life remains an open question.' 'Once we get beyond Mars, which formed from the same stuff as Earth, the likelihood that life is similar to what we find on this planet is very low,' he said. 'I think we're one generation away in our solar system, whether it's on an icy moon or on Mars, and one generation [away] on a planet around a nearby star. At the same conference last year, Nasa Administrator Charles Bolden made a more conservative estimate. He claimed that we will find life within the next 20 years - with a high chance it will be outside our solar system. Nasa next Mars rover, scheduled to launch in 2020, will search for signs of past life and bring samples for a possible return to Earth for analysis. Nasa also hopes to land astronauts on Mars in the 2030s, which Stofan says is crucial key to the search for Mars life. 'I'm a field geologist; I go out and break open rocks and look for fossils,' Stofan said. 'Those are hard to find. 'So I have a bias that it's eventually going to take humans on the surface of Mars \u2014 field geologists, astrobiologists, chemists \u2014 actually out there looking for that good evidence of life that we can bring back to Earth for all the scientists to argue about.' The space agency is also planning a mission to Europa, which may launch as early as 2022. It hopes to find out whether the icy moon is habitable. Meanwhile, the agency's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will launch in 2018 to scope out the atmospheres of nearby 'super-Earth' alien planets. New Horizons took this image of the icy moon Europa rising above Jupiter's cloud tops.\u00a0The space agency is planning a mission to Europa, which may launch as early as 2022, to find out whether the moon is habitable .\n"]}

A thug who shot a hero policeman in the hand as he was tackled to the ground after threatening to blow another officer's head off has been jailed for 12 years. Michael Olsen, 52, from Dartford, Kent, was challenged by PCs Mark Bird and Robert Wilson after abandoning his car in the middle of the road after ploughing into a traffic island and parked cars. He initially ignored the officers who were pursuing him by car but when they got out he turned round and pulled a gun to PC Wilson's head. When PC Bird lunged at Olsen in a bid to save his colleague he felt a sharp pain through his hand and realised he had been shot. They were able to restrain and arrest him, where they found a bag of bullets in his pocket. The 45-year-old officer, who is now back on duty, and his colleague had been called to a routine traffic accident in Welling on October 3, last year, when the incident unfolded. A Land Rover Freelander had been abandoned in the middle of the road after a crash and a member of the public had called to say the driver had walked off. The police officers went after Olsen in their car and spotted him walking along a nearby residential street where they confronted him. PC Bird, who has been in the force for nearly 23 years, said: 'I challenged him and he ignored us and carried on walking. We stopped the car almost straight away and jumped out. 'As I challenged him again he turned around, pulled out a revolver and pointed it about five or six feet away from Rob's head. He said: \"If you come any closer I will blow your effing head off\".' He added: 'I looked at his eyes, and I thought he means what he says he's going to do, so I went for him with my left arm to try and knock the gun away from him. PC Mark Bird (pictured) was attending a routine traffic accident with his colleague PC Robert Wilson in October last year when the incident happened . 'As I did this he turned towards me. I felt the gun in the palm of my hand and he fired one shot. I felt a really sharp pain, like someone pushing a knife through and then pulling it out again.' Police believe he was on his way to see his ex-girlfriend whom he was banned from seeing under bail conditions. PC Bird added: 'It was literally such a split second thing and we had to try to do something, because we were cornered really, and there was no way we were going to let him go. 'It's only afterwards that you realise the gravity of it. If the bullet had gone through the wrist, it could have gone up the arm and travelled towards the heart. 'Someone was watching over us that night. I'm still here, I'm still a police officer, I'm carrying on.' The officers challenged Olsen but he turned round and pulled a gun to PC Wilson's head. PC Bird stepped in to save him but as he did he was shot in the hand (pictured, his injuries) As Olsen pointed the revolver at the officer's head he threatened: 'If you come any closer I will blow your effing head off'. He denied knowing the gun was real but was found guilty at Inner London Crown Court . PC Wilson said: 'It happened so quickly. It's when you sit down afterwards and start to think about things, what ifs, what could have happened. 'You see the injury to Mark's hand and you think that gun was pointing at my head - so there's no way I'd be here now if Mark's hand hadn't got in the way.'

{"question_id": 928, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: All of a sudden, it seems that everywhere we turn there are suncream ads and the shops are filled with offers on summer essentials. So should we be making the most of the bargains to restock the bathroom cabinet \u2014 or can we ignore the marketing ploys and dig out supplies that have been lurking at the back for years? Alice Smellie asked industry experts to find out if it\u2019s really vital to buy new supplies for summer . . . Scroll down for video . Out-of-date sun lotions may separate and not spread evenly, say experts, meaning you may not be completely covered with vital UV filters, even if the active ingredients in the sun cream remain stable . SUNSCREEN . There can be few of us who haven\u2019t dug out half-full bottles of SPF30 from the previous year or, indeed, many years past, and wondered whether it\u2019s still OK to slather on. But a recent survey revealed that almost three-quarters of UK holidaymakers are at risk of UV exposure because they use out-of-date sun cream. Many experts recommend that we wear sunscreen every day all year round for anti-ageing purposes. Certainly now the weather is heating up, damaging UVA and UVB rays will be stronger. So, can we use old suncreams? \u2018Sun cream contains UV filters which fall into two main categories: synthetic or organic filters, which absorb UV light; and mineral or inorganic filters, such as titanium dioxide, which mainly reflect UV light. Frequently, both types are used in combination,\u2019 says Dr Chris Flower of the CTPA (Cosmetic, Toiletry & Perfumery Association). The issue is that out-of-date lotions may separate and not spread evenly, meaning you may not be completely covered with those vital UV filters, even if the active ingredients remain stable. When it comes to sun cream, experts advise playing it safe and restocking your supllies to ensure skin is properly protected from damaging\u00a0damaging UVA and UVB rays . Out-of-date lotions are also more likely to cause skin irritations. Ingredient specialist and product developer Tammy Hollis says: \u2018Look at how we treat our suncreams \u2014 carrying them from sandy beach to sunny bar and air-conditioned hotels. This gives plenty of opportunity for bacteria to breed.\u2019 So experts recommend you don\u2019t use a sun cream beyond the recommended period after opening. This is represented on the packaging with a picture of an open jar and a number of months (usually 12) in most popular brands of sunscreen. Meanwhile, Dr Flower advocates: \u2018Chances are it will probably be OK if it\u2019s just over a year old, although older bottles should definitely be binned.\u2019 VERDICT: Play it safe. Restock. AFTER-SUN . In an ideal world none of us would get sunburn, but occasionally we underestimate the heat of the sun. While it can\u2019t reverse the damaging effects of the sun, after-sun contains soothing ingredients such as water, aloe vera and silicones, which evaporate quickly from the skin and cool it down. Dr Flower says: \u2018The main effect is to cool and reduce the effect of over-heating and to help avoid skin peeling.\u2019 While after-suns may seem innocuous products, people forget they are applied to vulnerable, damaged skin. For this reason\u00a0it\u2019s vital that you adhere to the recommendations\u00a0regarding when you should discard lotions . While after-suns may seem innocuous products, people forget they are applied to vulnerable, damaged skin. For this reason, it\u2019s vital that you adhere to the recommendations regarding when you should discard lotions. \u2018Damaged skin may be more prone to developing irritations, allergies or infections anyway,\u2019 says Dr Flower. \u2018So the older the after-sun, the more likely it is to contain bacteria. If a pathogenic organism \u2014 a disease causing bacteria \u2014 was applied to damaged skin, then it\u2019s possible you might develop an infection of the skin.\u2019 VERDICT: Restock. MOSQUITO REPELLENT . No one wants to be the person on holiday who is stung from top to toe, and in tropical countries where malaria is a risk then an effective repellent is vital. But can you keep using the same spray year after year? \u2018Insect repellents work in two different ways,\u2019 says Howard Carter, CEO of Incognito mosquito spray and a mosquito bite prevention expert. \u2018Many brands use Deet as their active ingredient. This is a neurotoxin which interferes with the mosquito\u2019s nervous system. They become confused and are prevented from biting.\u2019 When it comes to bottles of insect repellent, experts say you're probably ok to use the same bottle for a couple of years, but keep a close eye on the use-by date, especially if travelling to far-flung countries . Howard says that if any bottle of Deet is open it must be replaced after two years because the active ingredient may stop working as effectively. He adds: \u2018Be aware that it can corrode through plastic bottles and cause damage to surrounding items.\u2019 He says that those containing natural ingredients such as citronella or bergamot, may only last a year \u2013 this is because oil may lose certain components of its scent and potency, though others, including Incognito, can last for up to two years. VERDICT: You\u2019re probably ok for a couple of years, but keep a close eye on the use-by date, especially if travelling to far-flung countries. FAKE TAN . The sun is shining but your legs are as white as the winter snow. Who hasn\u2019t shaken up that bottle of fake tan mousse that\u2019s been lurking at the back of a cupboard for an indeterminate number of years and looked despairingly at the green tinged product that emerges? \u2018The DHA which creates the brown colour is a derivative of fermented sugar beet,\u2019 says ingredient expert Tammy Hollis. \u2018When it goes on the skin it\u2019s not stimulating melanin production (which is what happens when you\u2019re in the sun), but reacts with proteins on the top layer of skin known as the epidermis to turn brown. Fake tan usually lasts 12 months once opened.\u00a0The active ingredient DHA\u00a0is usually in water-based solutions without many preservatives, say experts. \u00a0Once it is past its use-by date it oxidises and goes green . \u2018This active ingredient is usually in water-based solutions without many preservatives. Once it is past its use-by date it oxidises and goes green. The smell may become slightly metallic or stronger.\u2019 Fake tan usually lasts 12 months once open. VERDICT: If it looks ok, you can probably go ahead. BITE CREAM . This is a medicine cupboard staple which is probably used little more than twice a year, so it can take a long time to finish a tube. \u2018Anti-histamine, hydrocortisone bite creams and crotamiton itch creams are the three common forms of treatment for stings and bites,\u2019 says pharmacist Sultan Dajani, spokesperson for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. \u2018Once open, these creams will go off more quickly if they aren\u2019t stored properly \u2014 they must be in a cool, dark place otherwise bacteria may be introduced or they simply won\u2019t work as well. If you store it properly it will last up to the expiry date, which may be as much as two years.\u2019 VERDICT: Restock as soon as it is out of date, or if it is runnier than normal or smells funny. HAIR COLOUR PROTECTION SPRAY . UV exposure is extremely damaging for coloured hair. Scientists have found large amounts of cysteic acid (usually found in badly permed hair) in the ends of lank locks which had had a great deal of sun exposure. This causes hair to lose strength and snap. Protection in strong sunlight is highly recommended. Most hair protecting sprays recommend you discard after 12 months. Consultant trichologist Iain Sallis. \u2018If you store it in a cool dry cupboard with no light they may last longer than 12 months but once the heat and light of sunshine get in, as is likely on holiday, the ingredients will start to degrade more quickly.\u2019 The result is that hair will no longer be protected. VERDICT: If stored away from the light, you don\u2019t need to restock.\n"]}

The pain of a cancer diagnosis never went away, but after eight years of battling the condition, they cared for her and began to live with the disease. But though she had experienced enough grief, Stacey Johnson was soon delivered another cruel blow - doctors discovered her younger sister Dannii also had a growth in her brain. Stacey, now 22, was diagnosed with an inoperable  tumour in 2007 and has undergone gruelling rounds of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Her sister, Dannii, now 20, helped her mother care for her throughout her teenage years, and became her full-time carer last year. Stacey Johnson (left), 22, from Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, had just been told her brain tumour had grown when she was dealt another blow - her sister Dannii, 20, also had a tumour . Stacey (left) and Dannii (right)\u00a0have grown up sharing their toys and clothes, and now find themselves both battling ill . In December 2014, Stacey was told her brain tumour, called an astrocytoma, had grown. The family, who live in Much Hadham, Hertfordshire, began to process this frightening news, wondering what treatment Stacey would now have to undergo. But they then suffered another shock \u2013 as Dannii was diagnosed with a brain tumour. She had been feeling ill and had suffered headaches, so had gone to her doctor who had referred her for tests that confirmed there was a growth in her brain. She describes her surprise at being told her headaches were being caused by a brain tumour. Dannii said: 'I had never expected it to be a tumour. 'I have been with Stacey through it all and it never even occurred that me that that's what it could be. 'I was really shocked when they told me, but I just got on with it really. Dannii had been Stacey's full time carer since last year, but began to suffer headaches and feel ill. She was shocked to discover she too had a tumour, although hers is benign . Stacey has never been able to work since her diagnosis eight years ago, and has undergone gruelling chemotherapy. She is pictured here with her sister in 2012 . 'I was down for a few days after I was diagnosed, but I thought I can't do anything about it, so I just thought I had to get on with it.' Stacey, who is due start her next round of chemotherapy soon, said the news was so shocking it didn't seem real. She said: 'It sort of felt like a dream and I thought I was going to wake up from it. 'She is one of those types of people who just gets on with it. We are helping each other through it.' The sisters live with their mother, Sharon, 47, their father Brian, 48, and brother Charlie, 28. They were both born with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) - a condition that causes caf\u00e9 au lait spots (flat brown birthmarks) on the skin, freckles in unusual places, and benign lumps and bumps. One third of people with the condition will have one or more medical complication during their lifetime, which can include either benign or cancerous brain tumours. However, it is unclear whether the NF1 is related to the sisters' growths, and they say they have been told there probably is no link. Dannii is now awaiting a scan to see if it has grown and what the best course of treatment will be. Both sisters were born with neurofibromatosis type 1 - a condition that causes benign lumps and bumps, although they do not know if it is related to their development of brain tumours . Dannii said she was shocked when she too was diagnosed. She said: 'I have been with Stacey through it all and it never even occurred that me that that's what it could be. The sisters are pictured  in 1997 . She has been told her tumour is not cancerous, and is classed as Grade 1, the lowest risk. However, her mother, Sharon Johnson, 47, is worried the tumour could grow and endanger her health. Mrs Johnson, a housekeeper, said: 'I thought it was a joke when they first told us, I just couldn't believe how this could happen to us again. 'They started to explain more about it and I realised it was nothing like Stacey's. 'Dannii's is at the front of her brain and Stacey's is right at the back.' They have now set up a charity providing days out for children with terminal illnesses . Doctors say Dannii does not need surgery yet, but Mrs Johnson said when Stacey was first diagnosed with a tumour, doctors believed it was benign. She wants Dannii to have the tumours removed, so that it cannot grow and turn into cancer. She said: 'First of all they said they would take it out, but then they did a biopsy and found it wasn't cancerous, so they have decided to monitor for the next few months. 'I am annoyed that they're not doing anything. 'Exactly the same thing happened with Stacey, they said it wasn't cancerous but then it grew within three months. 'If they just take it out now then it wouldn't have the chance to grow. 'They've said that surgery is dangerous and they only do it when absolutely necessary though.' In an effort to help others in the same situation, Stacey has set up a charity called \"Kisses for Kids\" providing days out for children with terminal or long term illness. The two sisters now spend their time fund-raising for it. Sarah Lindsell, chief executive of The Brain Tumour Charity, said: 'A brain tumour diagnosis is a huge shock for anyone. 'For a family to experience it twice is extraordinarily cruel and our hearts go out to the Johnsons.

(Chatto & Windus \u00a316.99) Our fascination with aeroplanes, and the men who fly them (it is still overwhelmingly men), has acquired a morbid flavour since Germanwings flight 9525 was deliberately crashed into the French Alps by its troubled co-pilot Andreas Lubitz. The tragedy ignited an ongoing debate about stress and depression among pilots, and airline vetting procedures, in which just about all of us have a vested interest. This makes Mark Vanhoenacker\u2019s book, unwittingly, very timely indeed. When he was writing it he had never heard of Lubitz, of course, but nor does he dwell on the horrors of 9/11 or any other plane crashes either accidental or premeditated. Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways, who wants us simply to understand his passion for his job, and to share with us many of its more beguiling secrets. Like me, he was still a child when he was first invited into an aeroplane cockpit, and like me, he regarded it as one of the transcendent treats of his young life. But for him, the mystique endured. It is reassuring, now more than ever, to be reminded that even for experienced pilots air travel can still be an exhilarating, almost magical experience. Mark Vanhoenacker is a senior first officer with British Airways and he wants the reader to simply understand his passion for his job . Vanhoenacker, an American, worked as a management consultant before rekindling that childhood obsession. He learned to fly in Britain, tempted by our \u2018historic relationship with aviation\u2019. Coincidentally, his first job was to pilot the Airbus 320 on medium-distance European flights \u2014 exactly what Lubitz was doing on that catastrophically fateful day. But Vanhoenacker moved on to Boeing 747s, and they are his great love. He admires the 747 like a sculptor might a perfect human torso, observing how pleasing they are to the eye. Vanhoenacker recalls a wildlife writer once describing Virginia\u2019s great blue heron as \u2018the 747 of the swamp\u2019 and notes how this would delight the aircraft\u2019s chief designer, Joseph Sutter, who was greatly influenced by the anatomy of birds. But Sutter (now in his mid-90s) once stated that the 747 is more \u2018a place\u2019 than a conveyance. Pilots like flying 747s for all kinds of reasons, Vanhoenacker tells us, but not the least of them is one of the most prosaic: unlike the Airbus, in which pilots usually wear heavy socks, they have foot heaters. And the \u2018frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean looks better \u2014 everything looks better \u2014 when your feet are warm\u2019. He writes elegantly about his pilot\u2019s eye view of the world and explains that he has come to measure countries in jet time, ie how long they take to cross. Thus, Russia is a seven-hour country and Belgium, with a tailwind, is merely a 15-minute country. Noting the vast, desolate regions he routinely flies over, it does not surprise him that, according to one calculation, the portion of the Earth\u2019s surface on which an unclothed human could survive for 24 hours is just 15 per cent. But of even more interest, certainly to those of us who occasionally fly long-haul, are the nuts and bolts of those journeys. Vanhoenacker will get to the airport 90 minutes before he pilots his 747 to Los Angeles or Tokyo, and there will meet the rest of the crew, 20 or so strong. And \u2018meet\u2019 really means \u2018meet\u2019: air crews do not move as a pack, and are usually strangers to each other. As he puts it, \u2018our nametags are not worn only for passengers... There is a reasonable chance we may never speak to each other again in our lives.\u2019 Before boarding, he will brief the cabin crew on what kind of flight time and weather to expect, while they will tell him if there\u2019s anything noteworthy about the passenger roster, and whether any of the BA staff on board have friends or family on the flight, people known, splendidly, as \u2018Klingons\u2019. Unsurprisingly, life on a 747 is full of jargon: a second co-pilot on longer flights is known as \u2018the heavy\u2019, one acting as \u2018heavy out\u2019, the other as \u2018heavy home\u2019. And for a pilot, the sky is full of aerial milestones called waypoints, with names usually comprising five capital letters. These often relate directly to the place below, so above Boston in Vanhoenacker\u2019s home state, there is the waypoint LBSTA, referring to the region\u2019s prized shellfish, and another, NIMOY, after one of the city\u2019s more notable sons, the late actor Leonard Nimoy, who played Mr Spock in Star Trek. But other names are harder to explain. Above St Louis, Missouri, are the waypoints ANNII and LENXX. Vanhoenacker\u2019s best guess is that an air-traffic controller there was a fan of Eurythmics\u2019 singer Annie Lennox. Who would have thought that the mysteries of flying would embrace Mr Spock, Klingons and Annie Lennox? Skyfaring is crammed with these revelations and more, while the acknowledgments end on a plaintive note. Maybe one day, Vanhoenacker hopes, wide-eyed children will again be allowed in the cockpit during a flight. In the meantime, he does a very good job of telling us what happens in there, and why we should still trust the men at the controls.\n"]}

News broke this weekend that the committee investigating the NBC star found he lied in his reporting to make himself look good at least 11 times. The leaked information, along a report that Williams lied during an interview on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, is designed to make the disgraced anchor negotiate an exit from his network, according to  media executives. Scroll down for video . Leaked: Media executives who spoke to POLITICO say that information given to the press from the NBC investigation into anchor Brian Williams (above) was designed to make the broadcaster resign . Iraq shame: Williams fell from grace after veterans called him out after he lied about being on board a US military chopper which was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, but miraculously managed to land . Investigative journalists at the network have been poring over Williams's past reports and statements after he was booted from the top job in TV news, hunting down signs of dishonesty. Williams was publicly suspended with no pay for six months after it emerged that he repeatedly told a self-aggrandizing, false story about being aboard a military helicopter hit by an RPG over Iraq. The anchor has up to a $50million contract and POLITICO\u00a0claims that he is\u00a0being pressured to resign. The site reported that he could receive up to $30million in an exit agreement with NBC. 'You\u2019re dead. Now negotiate,' one media executive told the website. Williams signed a deal with the network last year to continue at the network thought to be worth $10million a year, and he is thought to be looking at a minimum of $20million if he leaves. The eleven incidents cited in media reports about the secretive investigation would mean the trail of deceit from the fallen face of NBC's Nightly News goes far deeper than previously reported. Further scrutiny of Williams's record turned up other questionable claims, including dodging rocket fire over Israel and seeing a body floating through the French Quarter of New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina. Even more such claims have been turned up now, according to reports by CNN and the Washington Post. Both cite a briefing given to\u00a0NBCUniversal CEO Steve Burke on Thursday in New York City at which top executives were updated on the investigation into their flagship news anchor's reporting. Egyptian experience: The latest specific Williams tall tale to emerge dates to 2011 in Cairo's Tahrir Square. Williams said he stared into the eyes of mounted regime soldiers during a violent protest . Tall tales: Information leaked from an NBC investigation points to 11 incidents where Williams lied about his reporting. Above, the anchor appears on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart (right) CNN said 10 claims had been found, while the Post said the figure was 11. An earlier report in the\u00a0New York Times\u00a0identified a particular incident, dating back to Williams' coverage of the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings. NBC investigators honed in on a February 2011 Daily Show appearance where Williams boasted that he had looked into the eyes of mounted Egyptian soldiers in Cairo's Tahrir Square, and seen armed men beat protesters. From his conversation with host Jon Stewart, Williams implies he was in the thick of the chaotic pro-democracy movement down on the ground. However, the Times said, NBC news broadcasts from the time only show that he was on a balcony overlooking the square from a safe distance during violent stretches. Close to the wind: Another questionable Williams claim comes from Israel's 2006 war with Hezbollah. Williams said rockets flew 'just underneath' a helicopter he was on when they seem to have gone nowhere near it . Williams is currently halfway through his six-month suspension from his roles as anchor and managing editor of NBC Nightly News. He was replaced by Lester Holt, who has kept ratings relatively steady. It is unclear whether NBC will put Williams back in the top slot when the suspension ends, or look for a way to get rid of him. Williams has reportedly been banned from speaking publicly about the investigation, or defending himself against any new claims. Industry analysts have said the NBC report is likely to prove significant as the network wrangles over what to ultimately do with Williams, whose contract kept him anchoring the Nightly News through 2019. The findings could play a part in any legal discussions, it was suggested, with NBC gaining leverage over its employee by either agreeing to keep it under wraps or threatening to go public. A decision about Williams's fate is still 'weeks away' according to CNN.\n"]}

Shigella infections, otherwise known as 'Delhi Belly' or 'Montezuma's revenge' were traced to people who had recently traveled to the Dominican Republic, India or other countries. The symptoms include diarrhea, stomach cramps and nausea. Outbreaks of the Shigella bacteria are not unusual, but this strain is resistant to the antibiotic most commonly prescribed for adults. Cases of shigellosis (bacteria pictured), otherwise known as 'Delhi Belly' or 'Montezuma's revenge' were traced to people who had recently traveled to the Dominican Republic, India or other countries . The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the report Thursday. The superbug sickened at least 243 people, in 32 states and Puerto Rico. Sometimes antibiotics are prescribed, especially for more serious cases. CDC Director Tom Frieden said in a statement: 'These outbreaks show a troubling trend in Shigella infections in the United States. 'Drug-resistant infections are harder to treat and because Shigella spreads so easily between people, the potential for more \u2013 and larger \u2013 outbreaks is a real concern. 'We\u2019re moving quickly to implement a national strategy to curb antibiotic resistance because we can\u2019t take for granted that we\u2019ll always have the drugs we need to fight common infections. Scientists  unlocked the genetic code of bacteria grown from a soldier who died of dysentery in World War I. Their findings revealed a superbug already resistant to penicillin and other antibiotics decades before they were in common use. CDC Director Tom Frieden said the spike in outbreaks show a 'troubling trend' in Shigella infections across the United States . Kate Baker of Britain's Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute said last November\u00a0that analysis of genetic differences between this 1915 sample of Shigella flexneri and three others isolated in 1954, 1984 and 2002 showed that while the bacterium has changed relatively little, the mutations it has acquired have made it more dangerous and persistent. It also went though what is known as a 'serotype conversion', she said, which made it able to re-infect and cause illness in people who had already been infected before and would previously have been immune to further attacks. Shigella causes an estimated 500,000 cases of diarrhea in the United States every year. CDC and public health partners investigated several recent clusters of shigellosis in Massachusetts, California and Pennsylvania and found that nearly 90 percent of the cases tested were resistant to ciprofloxacin (Cipro), the first choice to treat shigellosis among adults in the United States.\n"]}

The Hawks were not involved in the stabbing incident, police said, but were arrested on obstruction and other charges later. Though New York Police Department Det. Kelly Ort initially told CNN the incident occurred just before 4 a.m. at 1OAK, a club in New York's Chelsea neighborhood known to draw celebrities among its clientele, the club later told CNN that the stabbing occurred in front of the Fulton Houses project down the street. \"1OAK staff was unaware of the incident when it happened, as it occurred beyond their view in a different location. However, 1OAK's team assisted Mr. Copeland to their fullest capabilities, and called for help as soon as he was seen walking back towards the venue,\" the statement said. The statement continued, \"A review of the video footage seems to reveal the incident did not originate from the venue or its immediate surroundings that are under 1OAK supervision.\" Copeland and a female companion, Katrine Saltara, were in the club for about 10 minutes before leaving and walking down the street toward Fulton Houses, where their car was parked, said a 1OAK spokesperson. The spokesperson gave CNN additional details on condition of anonymity because 1OAK's legal team had approved only the club's official statement. The suspect, who the spokesperson said never entered 1OAK, stabbed Copeland and Saltara in front of Fulton Houses, and according to the club's statement, \"Mr. Copeland's driver sprang to accost and detain the apparent perpetrator and that individual is now in police custody.\" Charges against the suspect are pending, and his name will be released once charges are filed, Ort said. Copeland and Saltara tried to make their way back to the club to seek help from the 20 or so security personnel on hand, leaving a \"bloody trail of handprints\" between the site of the stabbing and the club, the spokesperson said. Copeland \"almost landed right next to the club,\" the spokesperson said, adding that surveillance footage will not show the actual stabbing because it occurred too far away from the club. The club shut down immediately after the incident, the spokesperson said. A male and two females were taken to area hospitals, Ort said. A knife was recovered, a suspect was arrested and two individuals not involved in the dispute -- the Hawks' Pero Antic, 32, and Thabo Sefolosha, 30 -- were arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and disorderly conduct, she said. Sefolosha faces an additional charge of resisting arrest, Ort said. Word of the stabbing quickly spread through the club, reaching Antic and Sefolosha, who went outside to check on their friend, Copeland, the 1OAK spokesperson said. At one point, the two began pushing their way through a crowd that had gathered around the scene, leading to their arrests, the spokesperson said. \"We will contest these charges and look forward to communicating the facts of the situation at the appropriate time,\" the players said in a joint statement released by the team. \"We apologize to our respective families, teammates, and the Hawks' organization for any negative attention this incident has brought upon them.\" The Hawks are in New York for a Wednesday night game against the Brooklyn Nets. Neither player will be in uniform, the team said. Police released little information Wednesday, but local media identified the injured man as Copeland, 31, who is from Orange, New Jersey. The Pacers released a statement saying Copeland suffered a knife wound to his left elbow and abdomen, and he's in stable condition at a New York hospital. \"We are aware that Chris Copeland was injured early this morning in New York City. We are still gathering information and will update when we know more. Our thoughts are with Chris and those injured,\" Larry Bird, the Pacers' president of basketball operations, said in a statement. Copeland's agent, John Spencer, issued a statement saying, \"We're concerned about the safety of Chris and Katrine. We don't have any details at this particular time. All we can do is pray and wait.\" The NBA and the Hawks front office said they were looking into the incident. \"We are aware of the situation involving Pero Antic and Thabo Sefolosha this morning. We are in the process of gathering more information and will have further comment at the appropriate time,\" Hawks spokesman Garin Narain said in an email. Copeland's Pacers are slated to play the New York Knicks on Wednesday night. The pair apparently had only recently arrived in New York prior to their arrests, as both were on the court for the Hawks' 96-69 win over the Phoenix Suns in Atlanta on Tuesday night. Antic played 12 minutes, and Sefolosha played 20. The game ended around 10 p.m. Copeland, a former Knick, was near the nightclub with Saltara when a 22-year-old Brooklyn man approached them, police told CNN affiliate WABC. There was some sort of dispute before the suspect stabbed the 6-foot-8-inch Copeland in the abdomen, slashed Saltara and then slashed another woman, the station reported. Saltara suffered cuts to her arm, breast and buttock, and the other woman suffered a slash to her stomach, CNN affiliate WCBS reported. While WCBS reported that the second woman was 53 years old, WABC reported she was 23. Images published in the New York Daily News showed a considerable amount of blood on the sidewalk and a white sports coupe, roped off with police tape, with several streaks of blood on its driver's side. Antic and Sefolosha interfered with officers trying to establish a crime scene, and one of the Hawks pushed a police officer, WABC reported. The Hawks are preparing for a historic playoff run after clinching the No. 1 seed in the NBA's Eastern Conference.

On Thursday, the Inverness defender was cleared to play in the Scottish Cup Final against Falkirk on May 30 after a charge of deliberate handball to deny Celtic striker Leigh Griffiths in last Sunday\u2019s semi-final was thrown out. In the aftermath of the 3-2 extra-time win, Meekings admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red-carded. Inverness defender Josh Meekings will be allowed to appear in Scottish Cup final after his ban was dismissed . His admission \u2013 backed by manager John Hughes \u2013 preceded the player being cited by the SFA compliance officer Tony McGlennan. That unprecedented move following a game in which a handball incident had gone unpunished, brought a warning from Jim Boyce, head of FIFA\u2019s referees committee, that a successful prosecution would open up a can of worms. Although such a scenario was avoided with the charge being kicked out, the furore surrounding the issue prompted the SFA go public on Friday with the tribunal panel\u2019s reasons. And it seems they accepted the preliminary argument of Inverness\u2019 legal representative that they weren\u2019t entitled to take the matter further. A statement read: \u2018Further to the judicial panel hearing on Friday involving Josh Meekings, the panel considered initial submissions from Mr Meekings\u2019 solicitor. \u2018In particular it was argued by him that under protocol 13.4.1.1 the judicial panel was not entitled to determine the matter. Meekings was not sent off and no penalty was given as Inverness went on to beat Celtic 3-2 after extra-time . \u2018The panel considered that as the incident (but not the actual alleged sending-off offence of handball) had been seen by one or more of the officials it was not entitled to consider the matter further. \u2018It accordingly dismissed the complaint without any consideration of the merits of the incident or the decision arrived at by the referee.\u2019 The explanation raises questions as to whether McGlennan ought to have cited Meekings in the first place. Meekings admitted he was fortunate not to have conceded a penalty and been red-carded against Celtic . However, legal sources have told Sportsmail that the SFA\u2019s prosecutor is entitled to cite players even in such instances when officials have seen an \u2018incident\u2019 but have failed to spot an \u2018offence\u2019. Yet it appears that in Meekings\u2019 case, the panel concurred with his solicitor\u2019s argument that they were not entitled to take the matter further as the match officials had seen the incident. The matter is further confused by the fact that former Hearts striker Ryan Stevenson and ex-Motherwell keeper Darren Randolph were previously banned retrospectively for serious foul play as the referees in question had seen the \u2018incidents\u2019 but missed the \u2018offences\u2019 in question.\n"]}

Making history: The two chimpanzees, living in a lab at Stony Brook University, Long Island, (not pictured) are the first animals to be granted the same rights as human prisoners . The decision by New York Supreme Court Justice Barbara Jaffe effectively recognises the chimpanzees as legal humans, the American Association for the Advancement of Science reports. The lawsuits were originally filed by the Nonhuman Rights Project in December 2013, in an attempt to free Hercules and Leo and two other chimpanzees living on private property. Although the courts threw out the suits, the animal rights' group has been appealing ever since, and have now been granted the writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the Stony Brook chimpanzees. A Stony Brook representative have been ordered to appear in court next month to respond the petition which argues that the chimps \u00a0should be set free and moved to a sanctuary in Florida. 'We are claiming that chimpanzees are autonomous,' The Nonhuman Rights Project's founder Massachusetts lawyer Steven Wise said in an interview last year. A representative of the university have been ordered to appear in a New York court next month to respond the petition which argues that Leo and Hercules should be set free and moved to a sanctuary (stock image) 'That is, being able to self-determine, be self-aware, and be able to choose how to live their own lives.' The 2013 lawsuits include affidavits from scientists who say chimpanzees have complex cognitive abilities, such as awareness of the past and the ability to make choices, and display complex emotions such as empathy. Although Judge Jaffe's ruling only requires a Stony Brook University representative to attend a hearing regarding Hercules and Leo next month, it can be used to set precedent for further legal action. 'This is a big step forward to getting what we are ultimately seeking: the right to bodily liberty for chimpanzees and other cognitively complex animals,' Natalie Prosin, the Executive Director of the Nonhuman Rights Project (NhRP) told the AAAS.

Bruce admitted that Hull, currently 15th in the table, have a tough run-in - what he referred to as 'the tickly bit' of the season - but insists the side are in good form. He added: 'In the last few weeks we have played well but we have not got the results we hoped for. Now we have to make sure we turn those performances into points.' Manager Steve Bruce is pleased to have Diame back as Hull enter the 'tricky bit of the season' Owner Assem Allam has again applied to the Football Associations that the team's name become Hull Tigers . Bruce added that he hoped the ongoing debate over the proposed name change for the club can be put to one side for the rest of the season - an arbitration panel has ruled that owner Assem Allam can make another application to change the name to Hull Tigers after it was initially refused by the FA council who took into account opposition from fans' groups. 'For what he has done for the club, putting it on the map and putting in his hard-earned money, the owner is entitled to have an opinion,' said Bruce. 'Hopefully there's a middle ground but at the moment I hope it can be put to one side and we make sure that Hull City/Hull Tigers are in the Premier League next season and we can have that debate in the summer.'\n"]}

The death toll there has doubled in a year's time, if an opposition group is right.

Violence has plunged well over half of all Syrians into such destitution that they are in dire need of survival aid, the United Nations says, as food rations are being cut for lack of donations. Numbers alone can't convey the immeasurable anguish of millions, but maybe it can remind the rest of us of the magnitude of the world's currently greatest tragedy.

Percentage of the Syrian population killed. It would be like killing 3 to 4 million Americans. The range comes from the SOHR's death toll of 310,000 and a recent lower estimate by the U.N. of at least 220,000 dead.

Real Madrid are four points behind Barcelona in the race for the La Liga title . Isco, a Spain international who was suspended for the Granada game, performed well first during Modric's lengthy injury lay-off and then during the absence of James and has become a huge favourite with the Real fans. Ancelotti, by contrast, has been whistled by some sections of the Bernabeu crowd as Real stumbled since the turn of the year and if he drops Isco and the team stutter again the Italian could be in for a torrid time.

{"question_id": 949, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Relations between Iran and Saudi Arabia have always been thorny, but rarely has the state of affairs been as venomous as it is today. Tehran and Riyadh each point to the other as the main reason for much of the turmoil in the Middle East. In its most recent incarnation, the Iranian-Saudi conflict by proxy has reached Yemen in a spiral that both sides portray as climatic. For Riyadh and its regional allies, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen -- \"Operation Decisive Storm\" -- is the moment the Sunni Arab nation finally woke up to repel the expansion of Shia-Iranian influence. For Tehran and its regional allies -- including the Houthi movement in Yemen -- Saudi Arabia's actions are in defense of a retrogressive status quo order that is no longer tenable. And yet both sides have good reasons to want to stop the Yemeni crisis from spiraling out of control and evolving into an unwinnable war. When Iranian President Hassan Rouhani was elected in June 2013, he pledged to reach out to Riyadh. He was up front and called Tehran's steep deterioration of relations with the Saudis over the last decade as one of the principal burdens on Iranian foreign policy. From Lebanon and Afghanistan to Pakistan and the Gaza Strip, the Iranian-Saudi rivalry and conflict through proxy has been deep and costly. And yet despite Rouhani's open pledge, profound differences over Syria and Iraq in particular have kept Riyadh and Tehran apart. But if the questions of Syria and Iraq prevented a pause in hostilities, the Saudi military intervention in Yemen since late March has all but raised the stakes to unprecedentedly dangerous levels. Unlike in Syria and in Iraq, the Saudi military is now directly battling it out with Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen. While Riyadh no doubt exaggerates Tehran's role in the Yemen crisis, its fingerprints are nonetheless evident. \"Iran provides financial support, weapons, training and intelligence to Houthis,\" Gerald Feierstein, a U.S. State Department official and former Yemen ambassador, told a Congressional hearing last week. \"We believe that Iran sees opportunities with the Houthis to expand its influence in Yemen and threaten Saudi and Gulf Arab interests.\" The Iranians find the charges biased and point to the Saudi airstrikes in Yemen as a much bigger case of meddling in a neighbor's affairs. In Iran, the cue came from the country's top authority, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has been unusually blunt. He tweeted: \"Despite disputes, the Saudis used to display composure [with] us but now inexperienced youngsters have come to power & replaced composure [with] barbarism.\" Three days after Khamenei's speech, Iran suspended religious pilgrimages to Mecca. This came as news broke about two Iranian teenage boys who had reportedly been sexually assaulted by the police while visiting Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, anti-Saudi protests have been staged in a number of Iranian cities. Khamenei's speech opened the floodgate of anti-Saudi statements. The voices of hardline figures in Tehran have been the most agitated. General Ahmad Purdastan, the commander of the Iranian ground forces, taunted the Saudis. \"Beware of the day when firecrackers explode in Riyadh,\" Purdastan said, in a not-so-subtle warning. But it was not only the hawks that came out swinging against the Saudis. Ayatollah Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, a former president and arguably Iran's most vocal advocate of better Iranian-Saudi relations. called Riyadh's military intervention a \"strategic mistake\" and urged for a political solution. Seeking a political solution is Iran's stated aim for the Yemeni crisis, but the prospects of such an effort succeeding are slim. Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif has provided a four-point plan: to get a ceasefire, to encourage the provision of humanitarian aid, to promote political dialogue among warring Yemeni parties, and to achieve the formation of an inclusive government. But the Iranian proposal also asks for an end to Saudi airstrikes. As Zarif put it, \"Iran and Saudi Arabia need to talk, but we cannot talk to determine the future of Yemen.\" The Saudis have thus far ignored the Iranian proposal. Meanwhile, the Houthi leadership has welcomed the plan. As one of its leaders said, \"In Iran's plan, unacceptable solutions do not exist.\" Not only do the Saudis not have any faith in any Iranian-drafted political package that is welcomed by the Houthis, but Riyadh believes that the international disposition favors it. Saudi Arabia was elated by the U.N. Security Council vote on 14 April that condemned the Houthi movement. Only Russia abstained. But a solution to the Yemeni crisis will not come from the U.N. The U.N. can provide a cover for Riyadh's military intervention, but it cannot secure it a military win. This leaves Riyadh with a fundamental question about how far it is willing to take its fight in Yemen. Saudi airstrikes alone will not finish off the Houthi movement and it allies in the Yemeni armed forces. It requires ground troops on a huge scale. Riyadh has tried hard to muster a military coalition that is willing to dispatch ground troops but its effort has so far been nothing short of a fiasco. The Pakistanis most famously turned down the Saudi request and let it be known that Yemen is a quagmire they can do without. Instead, Islamabad has asked Iran to push the Houthis for a political compromise that Riyadh can live with. The Turks were enthusiastic at first about stopping the Houthis -- but in his visit to Tehran last week, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan made it clear that he has prioritized Iranian-Turkish trade relations over rivalry in Yemen, and emphasized a political solution for the Yemeni conflict. The Egyptians and the Jordanians are still supportive of Saudi efforts and claim publicly to be open to the idea of deploying military forces to assist Riyadh in Yemen. But whether they will go through with it is another matter. Egypt has a long list of problems of its own, including a bloody counter-terrorism campaign in Sinai that it cannot afford to lose, but also an eastern border with lawless Libya that is increasingly a new front in Cairo's fight against jihadists. It is hard to see how Egyptian General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi can commit troops to a Yemeni campaign that is not a direct threat to Egypt's security. The same kind of domestic realities, including the threat from ISIS, will also prevent Jordan from any significant contribution to Saudi military efforts in Yemen. These hard realities leave Riyadh with two options. It can look for or even mediate a political solution that will invariably include the same Houthis that Riyadh is attacking today. Alternatively, given the absence of willing states to contribute ground troops, Riyadh will have to contemplate a full-scale invasion of Yemen. That is scenario that is very hard to contemplate. The Iranians too are faced with stark choices. It is beyond Tehran's ability to tame the Yemeni crisis. As tempting as it might be for Tehran to see the Saudis bleed in Yemen, the danger of this conflict further fuelling sectarian tensions in the Middle East will undermine broader regional Iranian interests. A political compromise that both Riyadh and Tehran and their respective Yemeni allies can live with seems to be the only option that is not cataclysmic.\n"]}

With hopes of retaining the Barclays Premier League crown looking increasingly forlorn, City have again failed to build on a title success. They were hampered last summer, however, with their punishment for breaching the Financial Fair Play regulations of European governing body UEFA including a \u00a349million net spending cap. Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists his side must splash the cash in the summer . Pellegrini has said Manchester City must sign a 'crack' player such as striker Sergio Aguero . Man City are currently fourth in the Premier League . A return to the heavy spending of the era immediately after Sheikh Mansour's 2008 takeover is clearly not an option, for fear of invoking even tougher sanctions, but Pellegrini has warned they cannot stay idle. Pellegrini recently spoke of a need to sign a 'crack' player - in other words a superstar of the calibre of striker Sergio Aguero - and has now suggested this summer is the time to do it. The Chilean, whose side have slipped to fourth place ahead of Monday's trip to Crystal Palace, said: 'Well, it is just the way of thinking, that big teams need to sign a big player. It is very difficult to do it every year - but every two years you must do it. 'I'm not just talking about Manchester City. You see Real Madrid, Manchester United, Chelsea, Barcelona and Bayern Munich - all the big clubs - they all do it. It is important to have big names.' Given the general disappointments of last summer's principle signings - Fernando, Bacary Sagna and Eliaquim Mangala - Pellegrini's words could be perceived as a plea for more cash. But when pushed further, Pellegrini, perhaps not surprisingly given that his own position could be uncertain, would not say whether a spending spree might be sanctioned. Pellegrini still believes his Manchester City side are capable of retaining the Premier Legaue title . He said: 'I don't want to talk about (plans) for next season because we have to finish this season. It is very important the way we finish this season before we analyse all the players. So it is not the right moment to talk about it.' Pellegrini's immediate concern is his side's league position. Results elsewhere have seen City drop two places over the weekend and, although Pellegrini has not given up on the title, he clearly cannot even take the runners-up spot for granted. He said: 'Well we are not thinking about just one team. I think it is important for our team to finish at the top of the table but if we can't win the Premier League then we must try to be second. 'But it is important to play from now until the end of the season in a way that shows you are an important team and are prepared to fight until the last game to try and retain the title.'\n"]}

The White House doubled down today on President Barack Obama's Earth Day message that climate change is 'a problem now' and knocked political figures who disagree with him as climate deniers and opportunists. The president is seen here on Wednesday, Earth Day, boarding Air Force One before departing from Florida. There  he mocked opponents of climate change and said global warming is a 'problem now' There he preached about the harmful effects of global warming on the environment and the economy and mocked skeptics of man-made climate change. 'Climate change can no longer be denied,' he said. 'And action can no longer be delayed.' 'This is a not a problem for another generation. Not anymore. This is a problem now. It has serious implications for the way we live right now.' The president's spokesman did not name-check opponents of Obama's argument on climate change today but it was evident that he was referring to conservatives such as Oklahoma Senator Jim Inhofe. The author of the anti-global warming book, The Greatest Hoax, Inhofe, has been a vocal critic of the administration's environmental policies. In late February he brought a snowball to the upper chamber's floor and presented it as evidence that global warming is a farce. 'It's very, very cold out. Very unseasonable,' Inhofe, chairman of the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, said and threw the snowball at the Senate president. Obama scoffed at the Republican lawmaker's antics in his Wednesday speech saying, 'yes, this winter was cold in some parts of this country, including Washington.' 'Some people in Washington helpfully used a snowball to illustrate that fact,' he noted. Taking a shot at Florida Governor Rick Scott, who allegedly banned the phrase climate change from his employees' vernacular, Obama said that 'simply refusing to say the words \"climate changed\" doesn\u2019t mean that climate change isn\u2019t happening.' 'If you\u2019ve got a coming storm, you don\u2019t stick your head in the sand,' he said. 'You prepare for the storm.' He said at another point in his remarks that climate change cannot be 'edited out' or 'omitted from the conversation.'

Responding to the question today about the Duke study, Earnest said  'the president is demonstrating genuine leadership by challenging the country and the world to confront [global warming].' Furthermore, he said, the president is going about it in a way that will 'not just safeguard the American people,' but one that can also have 'significant benefits for our economy.'

{"question_id": 954, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)German police overnight thwarted a terrorist plot by a radicalized couple, a plan they suspect involved bombing a bicycle race near Frankfurt, a German terrorism researcher briefed by investigators told CNN on Thursday. German prosecutors and police said that a man and a woman had been arrested in the Frankfurt-area town of Oberursel on suspicion of planning a Boston-style attack, but the authorities did not explicitly reveal the target. The suspected target, according to Florian Flade, the terrorism researcher, was a race planned for Friday. The race loops around Eshborn and Frankfurt on May Day each year, attracting large crowds of spectators along the cycle route. Prosecutor Albrecht Schreiber said police recovered a pipe bomb ready to be used, 100 rounds of 9mm ammunition, a gun, the essential parts of a G-3 assault rifle and 3 liters of hydrogen peroxide, which becomes explosive at high concentrations and has been used in multiple terror plots in the West, including the 2005 London bombings. Earlier Thursday, Andreas Hemmes, a spokesman for the police of West Hesse, told CNN that the house and car of two individuals in Oberursel, in the forested hills west of Frankfurt, had been searched. As a result of what had been found, police had expanded their search along the L3004 road on the bike race route, Hemmes said. \"We suspect that there was a Salafist background,\" said Peter Beuth, the interior minister for Hesse, referring to ultra-fundamentalist interpretations of Islam. \"Police investigations at this stage indicate that we have thwarted an Islamist attack.\" Flade, a journalist at Die Welt and terrorism researcher who first broke the story of the police raids, told CNN that a German couple of Turkish descent -- Halil and Senay D. -- were under arrest. He said the couple had ties to radical Islamist circles in the Frankfurt area. Neither is suspected of having direct links to the leadership of a terrorist group. Last week German police observed Halil D. moving in and out of a small forest near where he was living. They suspect he was looking for a good place to hide a bomb along the bike race route, according to Flade. Flade said that according to German police documents, German police first became aware of the couple at the end of March when they went to a garden center near Frankfurt to purchase hydrogen peroxide. He said the store employee contacted police after becoming suspicious for several reasons. The first was that the woman was covered in a full veil. The second was that the couple claimed they wanted to buy hydrogen peroxide to clean their fish pond in their garden, but the amount they were ordering would have been enough to clean dozens of such ponds. Furthermore, after police thwarted a bomb plot by German extremists trained in the tribal areas of Pakistan to kill American servicemen in Germany in September 2007 with hydrogen peroxide-based bombs -- the so-called \"Sauerland\" plot -- German law had required such stores to report to police significant purchases of hydrogen peroxide. According to Flade, after the tipoff, German investigators began trying to figure out who the couple were. All they had to go on was the surveillance footage. The woman was fully veiled and her male companion was blurry in the tape, so they did not immediately know who they were. But in early to mid-April they were able to identify them and start surveillance to investigate the couple's radical ties. According to Flade, German police established that the couple had recently traveled to Spain, where they met with members of Sharia4Spain, a radical pro-jihadist group linked to Al Muhajiroun in the United Kingdom. Spanish police had monitored the meeting in Spain. They also established that the couple had links to radicals who had gone to fight with AQIM, al Qaeda's North African affiliate . And they found the couple were in contact with a young radical Islamist from Frankfurt who had gone to fight in Syria at the end of last year and was recently killed. The pipe bomb that was recovered by police appears to have similarities to devices built by Boston Marathon bombers Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Flade said the device recovered near Frankfurt included nails as shrapnel. The Boston bombers downloaded instructions from a recipe in Inspire magazine, an online Engish language magazine put out by al Qaeda in Yemen, which has also been translated into German and other languages. In August 2013, the British security agency MI5 revealed to Parliament's intelligence and security committee that Inspire has been \"read by those involved in at least seven out of the 10 attacks planned within the UK since its first issue (in 2010). We judge that it significantly enhanced the capability of individuals in four of these 10 attack plots.\" Like other European countries, Germany is grappling with an unprecedented terrorist threat because of the high number of its citizens who have traveled to Syria and Iraq. In recent years there has been growing concern over radicalization in Germany's large Turkish diaspora community. Travel to Syria is particularly easy for individuals of Turkish descent because Turkey is the entry point for most foreign fighters traveling to Syria. According to Flade, almost 700 Germans are believed to have traveled to Syria and Iraq, with up to 90% joining ISIS. One-third of these have returned to Germany and 70 to 80 have been killed in the fighting in Syria and Iraq. There has only been one fatal terrorist attack in Germany since 9/11 -- the shooting death of two U.S. airmen outside Frankfurt Airport by a lone-wolf radicalized Islamist in March 2011.

While the 13 letters were expected to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, the only person who raised a paddle - for $260,000 - was a Sotheby's employee trying to jump start the bidding. The current owner of the signage is Yankee Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson, who purchased the 10-feet-tall letters for an undisclosed amount after the stadium saw its final game in 2008. No love: 13 letters that hung over Yankee Stadium were estimated to bring in anywhere from $300,000 to $600,000, but received no bids at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday . The 68-year-old Yankee said he wanted 'a new generation to own and enjoy this icon of the Yankees and of New York City.' The letters had beamed from atop Yankee Stadium near Grand Concourse in the\u00a0Bronx since 1976, the year before Jackson joined the team. ESPN reports Jackson, who attended the auction, bought the letters 'on a lark.' Jackson joked that once he saw the size of the letters, some of which are also 10-feet-wide, he realized he might have gotten ahead of himself. He promised before the auction that if the letters were bought by a bidder in the United States, he would fly out to see the signage himself at the winner's home. Yankee Stadium: The letters at the stadium, which was built in 1923, were installed in 1976 and taken down in 2008 . In addition to the letters, Sotheby's was auctioning off a New York Mets bullpen car from the late 60s. Despite the Mets memorabilia being estimated at only $20,000 to $30,000, it raked in a winning bid of $112,500 at auction.\n"]}

'But the cubs seem to be thriving under the 24-hour care provided by our animal specialists and veterinarians.' Video footage shows the newborn siblings writhing around and napping. The baby cats currently weigh a healthy 2.5lbs but they're set to grow to a heftier 650lbs. Their eyes are also closed but should open over the coming days. In safe hands: While the birth on Tuesday morning went smoothly, Irisa failed to show any maternal care so her offspring are currently being hand-reared in an incubator . Taking it easy: Video footage shows the newborn siblings writhing around and napping . It is unknown when they will go on display to the public and how keepers will go about naming them. These are the first cubs for ten-year-old female, Irisa, although the Zoo team and the Tiger Species Survival Plan (SSP) had hoped for years she would reproduce and pass on her valuable genes. This is the third litter sired by 11-year-old, Foli, since 2012. Gestation for tigers is about three-and-a-half months which means the cubs were conceived just weeks before Foli left for another facility in Kansas on February 25. He has been retired from breeding.

Jupiter was born at the Moscow Zoo in 2007 and came to the Columbus Zoo from the Dvur Kralove Zoo in the Czech Republic. Both males were moved at the recommendation of the Species Survival Plan in an effort to maintain a sustainable population of tigers in human care.

{"question_id": 957, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)The death of Freddie Gray, which was the flashpoint for the protests and now the riots in Baltimore, has raised again the questions surrounding  police use of force, especially after the now-familiar video of officers arresting Mr. Gray and loading him into a police van. Gray was arrested by police on April 12. The 25-year-old was carried in the van for 40 minutes and he was not properly buckled in, according to authorities. Gray's family said his voice box had been crushed and his neck snapped, and after a week of hospitalization, he died. Police Commissioner Anthony Batts has said, \"We know our police employees failed to get him medical attention in a timely manner multiple times.\" The police and the U.S. Justice Department are investigating. The case raises at least three legal issues: . Believe it or not, the charging document in this case gives us more information than the now-viral video of the arrest.In that narrative, police state \"Defendant fled unprovoked upon noticing police presence.\" According to the officers' words, that's the sole reason a stop was initiated. There is no other description of either criminal activity or safety concerns.  The next sentence is important too: \"The defendant was apprehended in [a specific location] after a brief foot chase.\"  The police are locked in: it appears that by their own narrative that the unprovoked flight was the only reason for the stop, because the very next thing that happens...is the stop. Can the police stop you if all you do is run from them when you see them? For the most part, yes. But having grounds to stop is not the same as having probable cause to make an arrest. In this case, Mr. Gray took off running. The United States Supreme Court and Maryland courts have made clear that unprovoked flight -- running away from the police for no reason -- is enough to support reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed. When you add to the suspect's flight the Supreme Court's recognition that the character of the neighborhood is also a factor in assessing reasonable suspicion, it appears that the police in this case had at least enough to justify the stop, constitutionally. Much to the chagrin of public defenders and defense attorneys, as long as an officer testifies minimally to an individual (1) running away, (2) in a \"high crime\" area, the stop will usually be \"good.\" But police are supposed to articulate the additional safety concern to get to the frisk. Police must also have reasonable suspicion that the suspect may be \"armed and presently dangerous\" to additionally conduct a carefully limited search of the outer clothing for the sole purpose of discovering weapons. The charging document doesn't really identify a safety concern ... or does it? After the chase, and before an arrest: \"This officer noticed a knife clipped to the inside of his front right pants pocket.\" Shouldn't that really say: \"I saw a clip but whatever it was clipped to was inside a pocket ... where I couldn't see it\"? That's a close call: Police were lawfully at the stop stage, but the knife -- even though it was inside his pants pocket -- was visible from the outside ... because of an identifying knife clip? See how artfully that was done? Observation of a knife is definitely a safety concern. Observation of a clip? I suppose that will get the officer to the frisk of the pocket ... assuming he is a connoisseur of knife clips and can differentiate them from hair clips, chip clips, etc. According to William Murphy, an attorney for Gray's family, he was carrying a \"pocket knife of legal size,\" and the lawyer contended that police didn't see the knife before the altercation. The legality of the knife will be an issue, but police have essentially conceded that the knife was not seen until the stop. The important thing here is that a stop and frisk is not the same as an arrest. In theory, if a stop gives rise to no suspicion, and a frisk yields nothing more than a comb and some pocket lint, the citizen should be free to leave. An arrest requires much more: probable cause to believe a crime has been committed, and nothing less. That knife was the only crime he was charged with, so again, police are locked into a narrative by their own report. If it ultimately turns out to be a legal knife, there will be a lot of scrutiny on the decision to arrest. For example, if the \"knife\" was one of those pointy files attached to a 2-inch nail clipper, that does not sound like good faith probable cause for an arrest. Remember also that based on the police narrative in the report, they did not see the knife until after they seized Mr. Gray. So the question arises: What would they have done with Gray if he had no knife or other contraband on him? They could, but most likely not unless there was some intentional act that resulted in Gray's death. As we've seen, charging officers with crimes -- especially murder -- is rare and difficult. If you're pro-cop, you could say that's because they are well-trained and rarely abuse their force. If you have a more jaded view of law enforcement, you would say it's because they are well-trained, and consequently very skilled at testifying or explaining their use of force. Baltimore Police are suggesting Mr. Gray's injuries occurred after his arrest, while he was being transported back for processing, and that he may not have received proper medical attention. That's not a surprise. In fact, from a liability perspective, this is a good strategic move for the police. It will be harder to hold them liable if Gray's injuries happened after -- not before -- his arrest. Pre-arrest, Gray's \"seizure\" would be judged by a \"reasonableness\" standard, under the Fourth Amendment. However, courts have limited these \"seizures\" to the initial act of seizing the person. Any excessive force claims after the arrest are not covered by the Fourth Amendment. The claims of an arrestee are instead governed by a different constitutional provision: the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment. So what? What's the difference between the Fourth and 14th Amendment anyway? When it comes to potential civil liability of the officers, it makes a huge difference. The applicable burden of proof and chances of winning a lawsuit depend largely on which constitutional standard governs. Under the Fourth Amendment, the test is whether the force was objectively unreasonable based on the totality of the circumstances. Under the 14th Amendment standard, the officer will only be liable if the force was applied maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing unnecessary and wanton pain and suffering. That's a much tougher burden for a plaintiff to meet. Fortunately, courts have held that pretrial detainees like Freddie Gray are entitled to at least the same protection under the 14th Amendment as are convicted prisoners under the Eighth Amendment, and its prohibition against \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" in this case the deliberate indifference to medical needs of prisoners. Confused? You're not alone. Even a Supreme Court justice has taken issue with this view of the Constitution. Other jurisdictions have actually opted to extend the protections of the Fourth Amendment after arrest, so not only could reasonable minds differ ... reasonable courts, judges, and states differ, too. It's just that Maryland is not within one of those jurisdictions. But it's true. It's a kind of unintentional \"gap\" in constitutional coverage, one the courts have struggled to deal with. Based on the law, it seems that if an arrestee is hurt during a \"rough ride,\" police might avoid liability in Maryland if they contend the injury was not caused wantonly or sadistically. That's a higher standard for liability than if Freddie Gray was hurt pre-arrest, so, if it's the truth, it just happens to also be a constitutionally convenient one.\n"]}

Julie Stauch and married couple Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy all appear in on the video announcing Clinton's 2016 bid. They are part of a diverse group of people - from young mothers and people preparing for retirement, to Spanish-speaking brothers preparing to start a business and an Asian-American college graduate looking for her first job - chosen to show aspirational citizens as Clinton looks to speak to to wide demographic of voters. 'Everyday Americans need a champion, and I want to be that champion,' Clinton says on the video. 'So I'm hitting the road to earn your vote.' But far from being 'everyday Americans', as the two minute video claims, Stauch and Bagniewski are directly involved with the Democrat party - just like campaigners Jared Milrad and Nate Johnson, from Chicago, Illinois, who discuss their upcoming wedding plans on screen. Scroll down for video . Sean Bagniewski and Vidhya Reddy appear discussing their plans for 2015 on Cinton's video announcing she is running for president - the Secretary of State's 'plan' for this year . But it has been revealed Bagniewski, who has previously run as for Des Moines City Council, was a campaigner for Clinton in 2007. Bagniewski, who lost  in 2013, is also said to be in talks with\u00a0Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s people and may support him . Lawyers Bagniewski and Reddy are shown in their home in Des Moines, Iowa, discussing their plans for 2015. 'We've been doing a lot of home renovations,' Reddy tells the cameraman. But then Bagniewski chimes in: 'But most importantly, we really just want to teach our dog to stop eating the trash.' 'And so we have high hopes for 2015, that that is going to happen,' she laughs. However, their plans for this year may not involve actually supporting Clinton's White House bid. A source has told the DailyMail.com Bagniewski, who ran for Des Moines City Council in 2013, losing by 270 votes, is in talks with\u00a0Martin O\u2019Malley\u2019s people and may support him. Indeed, Bagniewski revealed to the Des Moines Register that he had been hosting an event for O'Malley last Thursday. O'Malley, who has just completed two terms as Maryland governor, is said to be considering running for president himself. The Democrat, 52, is expected to declare in May, but is keeping relatively tight-lipped about his intentions. 'My wife and I will make a decision on that when the time is right,' O'Malley told the Baltimore Sun\u00a0earlier this year. But it seems Clinton's campaign team can breathe a sigh of relief: Bagniewski went on to tell the Register: 'O'Malley's great - but for me, Hillary Clinton is just head and shoulders above all the competition.' Julie Stauch is another person who appears on the video with strong links to the Democrat party . Stauch, an Iowa resident, is the former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis . Meanwhile Stauch, who is filmed in her West Des Moines garden, is a former state senate campaign manager for Democrat Wendy Davis, who unsuccessfully ran to be governor of Texas in 2014. Davis is best-known for he 11-hour filibuster to block a bill which would have meant the closure of almost every abortion clinic in the state. Stauch has worked in a PR office for Planned Parenthood, and a LinkedIn profile now shows her as the group\u2019s top lobbyist in Iowa. However, in the video she is a woman famed for the produce gleaned from her Iowa garden. 'It's spring, and we are starting to get the garden ready - and my tomatoes are legendary in my own neighborhood,' she said. Jared Milrad (pictured right) and fianc\u00e9 Nate Johnson have also been revealed as campaigning Democrats . The couple, who are planning a summer wedding, were featured walking hand in hand during Clinton's video . The video, which has had 3,477,630 on YouTube since its launch on Sunday, has quickly become one of the most viewed political broadcasts of the year - a fact which will no doubt help Clinton as she begins meeting people in Iowa today. Featuring snappy music, and showing Clinton for less than half the running time, it is a dramatic departure from the campaign launch of seven years ago, which showed the Secretary of State\u00a0on a couch, talking about ending the Iraq war, shrinking deficits and expanding affordable health care. The 2015 video has managed to strike a chord with a range of people, with Democrat campaigners Milrad and Johnson talking about their up-coming nuptials capturing people's imagination. Milrad's voice is heard in a voiceover saying: 'I\u2019m getting married this summer to someone I really care about.' Milrad, who did not know they would be on the video, said he was overjoyed to be part of the Clinton rollout - and part of a large-scale change in U.S. social attitudes. 'It shows how far we've come,' said Milrad, 31-year-old lawyer and social activist, pleased that public support for same-sex marriage rights has grown so far as to appear in a presidential campaign launch. Mr Johnson, 30, is a project manager for a health care consulting company. The couple will get married in July in a Chicago park bordering Lake Michigan then have their reception at a LGBT community center, The Washington Blade\u00a0reported. The couple told The Blade that they would be making financial contributions to Clinton's campaign and would volunteer. Both have previously volunteered in presidential campaigns.

Klopp revealed on Wednesday that he will not be fulfilling the remainder of his contract, which was due to expire in 2018. Instead, he will be terminating his agreement with the Westphalians in the summer to seek a new challenge, but he has vowed to win as many games as he can before bringing his seven-year reign to an end. Jurgen Klopp (centre) speaks to Mats Hummels (left) during Borussia Dortmund's Thursday training session . The Borussia Dortmund coach leads the team's training session as they prepare for a German league match against Paderborn this weekend . And he expects the players to do the same, insisting they will be fully focused for Saturday's Bundesliga clash with Paderborn. 'We can draw strength from this story together,' Klopp said at Thursday's press conference. 'We've always been able to find reasons to do something quite special.' Klopp relayed the reactions of the players to his decision to the assembled press, saying: 'Nobody applauded me - so I guess that's a good thing. You need a moment to deal with such information, which is why I didn't really assess much of what happened in training (on Wednesday), but that's over now. Klopp announced his departure from Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday after seven years . Klopp said he believed Dortmund needed a change of manager, but has urged his team to keep smiling . 'I want to see the players smiling, even if then somebody might write that the players are glad Klopp's leaving.' The fans will have had a few days to digest the news too, by the time Dortmund run out at the Westfalenstadion on Saturday, and Klopp expects the atmosphere to be no different to usual. 'If somebody feels they need to give me or my coaching team three cheers, then they would be wrong,' he added. Klopp has already been linked with a number of leading clubs around Europe . Klopp won the Bundesliga title twice during his seven years as Dortmund manager . 'I don't expect it and I don't need it. The important thing is that they get behind the team for 90 minutes.' Earlier on Thursday, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger refused to add to the speculation over whether Klopp's next assignment will be in the Barclays Premier League. Klopp insisted on Wednesday that he had had no contact with any clubs, but stressed he did not plan to take an extended time-out from the game. The German has been installed as favourite to replace the under-fire Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City, but Wenger was keen not to add fuel to the fire when quizzed on the matter. 'I'm not an agency to place managers and I like every manager and respect everybody, but I find that circus a bit ridiculous,' the Frenchman said. On whether Klopp would suit Arsenal, Wenger said: 'I already answered this question.' Wenger does not believe Dortmund players will necessarily look to follow the charismatic 47-year-old out of the Westfalenstadion. The emotion was clear to see as Klopp announced he was leaving the club at a Wednesday press conference . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger branded the 'circus' around Klopp's decision as 'ridiculous' 'It's down to every club to make the right decision and to respect Dortmund,' he said. 'Dortmund is a massive club and will survive, and has the ability to keep their best players. 'They have a big history linked with great results and great achievements, so I don't think that will stop for Dortmund.' Klopp has enjoyed a hugely successful spell in charge of Dortmund since taking over in 2008, leading the club to two Bundesliga titles, DFB-Pokal success and the Champions League final. This season has been more of a struggle, with the club battling it out at the bottom end of the league for much of the campaign and currently sitting 10th. Asked about any advice he would give to foreign managers heading to the Premier League, Wenger replied: 'Try to get your ideas through and adapt as well to the local culture, and respect it.'\n"]}

'In the next phase of this case you will learn a lot more,' defense lawyer Judy Clarke told jurors during closing statements . in Tsarnaev's trial. O'Toole also reminded jurors to avoid all media coverage, . especially on the second anniversary of the bombings on . Wednesday. The prosecution is expected to portray the ethnic Chechen as an Islamic extremist adherent of al Qaeda who planted one of the two homemade pressure cooker bombs at the race's finish line on April 15, 2013, because he 'wanted to punish America for what it was doing to his people,' in the words of Assistant U.S. Attorney Aloke Chakravarty. The defense, meanwhile, is expected to play up the role of his 26-year-old brother, Tamerlan, in carrying out the attack. In closing arguments last week, defense attorney Judith Clarke contended that Tamerlan was the driving force behind the bombing, with Dzhokhar following along. Tamerlan died during the brothers' chaotic final day of freedom. Three days after the bombing, the pair shot dead a police officer and carjacked a Chinese businessman as they attempted to flee the city. The carjacking victim escaped and alerted police to their plans, setting the stage for a gunfight between the Tsarnaevs and law enforcement that ended when Dzhokhar roared off in the stolen SUV, running over his brother.

Tiger Woods made his first appearance at the Masters as a 19-year-old back on April 3, 1995. Woods said he was not impressed by the iconic venue when he first drove through the gates. He said: 'When I first arrived here \u2014 Magnolia Lane, is that it? \u2014 I thought that it was a pretty short drive. 'From what everyone says, it\u2019s majestic and a long drive, you can\u2019t believe it, and this, that and the other.' Tiger played 18 holes at the course on Tuesday and insiders from the Golf Channel say he has now returned to the venue for a practice session. Woods did not play last year's Masters following back surgery - the first time he had missed the event since he first played it in 1995. On Monday, Woods dropped out of the top 100 in the world rankings for the first time in almost 19 years. The 14-time major winner did not record a top-10 finish in nine starts in 2014, and has missed three cuts and withdrawn twice in his last six Tour starts. Woods' last title came at the World Golf Championships-Bridgestone Invitational in August 2013. Woods, pictured driving off the 10th tee in April 1995, made his Masters debut 20 years ago . Woods has won the Masters on four separate occasions with his last win coming in 2005 .\n"]}

Youngstown State University student government leaders said they decided to remove the posters, which were hung on around campus earlier this week, after consulting with university officials. The posters included profanity and promoted the event as a time to not highlight sexual orientation or differences among students. Posters promoting a 'straight pride' week were removed from campus after student leaders said that they went 'way further than a free speech issue' They encouraged students to 'go about your day without telling everyone about how 'different' you are', according to WKBN. The anonymously posted flyers encouraged students to celebrate 'by not annoying the s*** out of everyone about your sexual orientation'. 'Brought to you by the students that are sick of hearing about your LGBT pride,' the posters read. 'Nobody cares about what you think you are, or what you want to have sex with. We have nothing against your sexual orientation. We just don't give a f***.' Campus leaders at the approximately 15,000-student university said that while they believe the posters were meant as satire, the message was inappropriate. 'If you actually read through it, it seemed like it went way further than a free speech issue,' said Student Government President Michael Slavens. 'There were swear words and took it a little further than the average free speech should go.' Student Government vice president Jacob Schriner-Biggs agreed with Slavens. 'When you are talking about minority activism, it is very easy that if you are in the majority to say \"well, this sort of activism is not necessary. This sort of zeal in your activism is over the top\",' he said. 'For minorities who experience discrimination, that is not the case,' It is believed by student leaders that the posters were satire, but they still missed the point of activism, a statement from the student government says . The posters counter the school's mission to create a diverse campus, university spokesman Ron Cole told WFMJ. Officials are investigating possible student code violations, and disciplinary action may follow. A statement from the student government said while it respects free speech of all students, the posters weren't authorized, contained vulgar language and missed the point of activism. 'When individuals belong to dominant societal cohorts (Caucasian, male, heterosexual, etc.) it is very easy to state \"We have nothing against your sexual orientation\" and to claim that efforts to raise awareness are \"annoying\",' it read, according to Gay Star News. The statement continued: 'For minorities who every day face discrimination and marginalization, such efforts are necessary without zeal and persistence, sociology teaches that minority concerns very easily go by the wayside. 'Thus, dismissing the efforts of LGBTQIA students to push for equitable treatment as unnecessary is dangerous because it catalyzes discrimination, whether meant to do so or not.' University officials are investigating into the posters, which were hung anonymously, and disciplinary action may follow .\n"]}

Dorset-born Cook who was overlooked for the Great Britain taekwondo squad at London 2012, applied for citizenship earlier this month after receiving funding from Moldovan billionaire Igor Iuzefovici and has already received his passport from the small eastern European state. The British Olympic Association (BOA) announced on Thursday morning that they had ratified the 24-year-old's move - issuing a statement to confirm the news. Taekwondo fighter Aaron Cook's application to switch allegiances to Moldova has been approved . Three time European champion Aaron Cook (right) has refused to fight for Great Britain since May 2012 . Cook has felt aggrieved at the decision to leave him out of the 2012 London Olympic squad . 'Following a request from taekwondo athlete Aaron Cook to change his sporting nationality from British to Moldovan, the British Olympic Association (BOA) today announced that Cook's request has been approved,' it read. 'The board of the British Olympic Association met on Monday 13 April 2015 to discuss Aaron Cook's request to change his sporting nationality.' There had been long-standing animosity from Cook towards GB Taekwondo after he felt he had been kept out of the squad for London 2012 because he had decided to quit the British programme in 2011. Lutalo Muhammed was selected instead and won the bronze medal, but Sweeney says the door was open for Cook - who has instead opted to represent Moldova. 'We are very disappointed,' the BOA chief executive told BBC Radio Five. 'He is world number one and Olympic-ranked number two. He is a great athlete... and we are saddened to lose an athlete of that calibre who is British. 'For him to move from his country of birth and home nation to represent another country - we are disappointed. 'I can promise you we have been working really hard not only in recent months but for a long time now, both with Aaron and his representatives and British Taekwondo. It has been well documented that there have been some difficulties in that relationship that go back to pre-2012. 'We have been looking to find a solution where we could broker that deal. We have worked hard to make sure there is a robust and fair selection policy in place. He was the name quota athlete to go to Baku European Games in June but in his mind he feels his best opportunity to get to the Olympic Games in 2016 is with another country.' Cook, who fought for Team GB at Beijing 2008, announced his intention to change nationality in a statement on Facebook at the start of April, saying: 'Although I am upset and disappointed I will not represent my country of birth at another major championships, I felt I had no other option. 'Having received no funding or support from the GB system and financing myself since June 2011, this was not a situation that was acceptable to me and I did not want to put myself, family, friends, supporters or sport through the same situation we were forced to endure at the London 2012 Olympic Games.' Jeremy Beard, the chairman of GB Taekwondo, said in a statement: 'Having secured his place at the upcoming European Games, we are naturally disappointed that Aaron Cook does not wish to represent Great Britain in Baku, nor at the Olympic Games in Rio. 'We have made exhaustive efforts to engage with him and his team for some time, but sadly it seems that he has made the decision that his future lies elsewhere and we wish him well. British Olympic chief Bill Sweeney says there was nothing that could have stopped Cook switching . Cook competes against Mauro Sarmiento at the Olympic Games in Beijing in 2008 . Jamie Cunningham, Cook's former agent, is pleased he has a pathway to the Olympic games . 'Our focus now is on providing the best support we can to the athletes striving to achieve medal success for Great Britain in Baku, at the upcoming World Championships in Russia next month and ultimately at the Olympic Games in 2016.' Cook has previously said he hopes to represent Moldova for the first time at the inaugural Baku European Games in June.

For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront by Tuesday night, so that he can undergo the operation on Wednesday morning. On Monday morning they reached the target on their\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0page, but Jackson's mother says the family needs an additional $45,000 to cover chemotherapy and other hospital fees. Three weeks ago the 18-year-old was told by doctors that he had a stage four brain tumour that was too deep and aggressive to be safely operated on. Jackson Byrnes, 18, has flown to Sydney for a risky operation to remove the tumour on his brain . For the past week Jackson's family and friends have been desperately trying to raise $80,000 needed to pay the hospital upfront for the risky surgery . Jackson's girlfriend Jahnae Jackson (right) noticed he had developed a lump three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI . His family refused to accept the dismal diagnosis and took matters into their own hands and found Dr Teo, who said he was willing to perform the operation if the family understood the risks. Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said Dr Teo explained to her that  her son would most likely be paralysed down his left side. 'But he's already paralysed because the tumour is pressing down on that side of his brain, that's why we've just said go for it,' Ms Byrnes told Daily Mail Australia. 'I can't afford not to because I won't have my son around if I don't take these risks. 'Dr Teo is the best brain surgeon in the country, I've got my son's life in his hands basically.' Dr Teo, director of Sydney's Centre for Minimally Invasive Neurosurgery, said other surgeons were technically able to perform the surgery but he was the only one prepared to do it. 'People think that it's futile because he's got a malignant tumour and it's very aggressive,' Dr Teo told Daily Mail Australia. 'There's significant weakness down his left side and they think his quality of life is such that he wouldn't want to live anyway.' But Dr Teo said he makes decisions based on what his patients want. 'If a patient really wants it and knows the risks and understands how risky the operation is I'll usually respect the patient's wishes,' he said .

'He is a lovely boy and he's only young. 'I said \"You know you're going to be paralysed\", I've told him the worst case scenario. 'He understands that and he wants to live.' Dr Teo will try to remove 95 per cent of the tumour, which has extended to very sensitive part of the brain. 'If you can buy him time with surgery then the hope is you're going to get a good response to the chemotherapy and radiotherapy and a significant extension of time,' he said. 'Even if we could buy him six months of life the hope is we're going to come up with new treatment in that time.' Dr Teo said the $80,000 payment required for the surgery was standard. Jackson needs  $80,000 by Tuesday night in order to pay for his surgery upfront, and another $45,00 for fees . Renowned neurosurgeon Dr Charlie Teo is the only surgeon in Australia willing to perform the risky operation that will likely see Jackson paralysed . 'I operate at a private hospital and they insist on upfront payment, you can't blame them they run it like a business,' he said. 'I don't know how much it costs I don't try and talk about the money side of things. 'But that is the cost of everything and it's also an insurance for the hospital should he get complications.' Jackson's mother Rhonda Byrnes said she was overwhelmed by the support and money raised by the community on his\u00a0GoFundMe\u00a0page, but said the family still needed more.

According to the\u00a0Gold Coast Bulletin, Mr Byrnes' girlfriend, Jahnae Jackson, noticed he had developed a lump  three weeks ago and prompted him to visit a doctor who requested an MRI. He was rushed to the Gold Coast for a biopsy which found a stage four tumour buried deep in the teenager's brain. Mr Byrnes was told they would not operate due to how deep the cancer was, but instead suggested chemotherapy and radiation treatment. Messages of support and promotion of the cause have flooded social media for the Casino teenager . The donations have been coming in thick and fast since the GoFundMe page was created . Knowing that this was not enough, Mr Byrnes and his family searched for a specialist who would perform the dangerous procedure. They found neurosurgeon Charlie Teo who would operate on Wednesday as long as he received an upfront payment of $80,000 by Tuesday evening. The family then turned to social media and crowd sourcing in a desperate plea for donations. 'Most boys his age begin their journey into adulthood with hopes , dreams and anticipation of what lies ahead and excitement of the endless opportunities of what life will bring them,' Mr Byrne's fundraising page on GoFundMe reads.

Police have arrested two 17-year-old boys on suspicion of preparing to travel to Syria to join terrorists, while also detaining a 'terror fundraiser'.

A 39-year-old man in Coventry has also been held on suspicion of fundraising for the purpose of terrorism, Scotland Yard said. All three are currently in custody in a West Midlands police station and have been detained under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. The legislation gives officers a maximum of 36 hours before they can charge, release, bail or apply for further detention.

A Metropolitan Police spokesman said the arrests were part of two separate investigations while officers say enquiries into both are continuing. The West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit has appealed for help in identifying would-be terrorists after it was revealed there had been a rise in the number Syria-related investigations in  the region. One of Britain's most senior counter terrorism officers, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley, explained the challenge for police is identifying potential jihadi fighters. This is because many of the young people from the West Midlands suspected to have travelled to the conflict zone had no previous links to extremist groups. Detective Chief Superintendent Sue Southern, who heads up the West Midlands Counter Terrorism Unit, said: 'We are seeing young people who previously had no reason to be known to the authorities, being radicalised.

In a court case likely to cost \u00a3150,000, St John's College and a 74-year-old businessman have been locked in a battle over an unkempt hedgerow between their properties in Warwickshire. The bizarre dispute began when Anthony Bethell decided he would pay for work to restore the ancient 180-yard hedge, which marks the boundary between his home and the college's land. Hedge row: Anthony Bethell and St John's College, Oxford are\u00a0embroiled in a row over a stretch of scrubby bushes, with a court case likely to cost \u00a3150,000 . The bizarre dispute began when Anthony Bethell decided he would pay for work to restore the ancient 180-yard hedge, which marks the boundary between his home and the college's land . Before starting the work, Mr Bethell thought it best to consult with the college - which is one of the largest landowners in the country - on where exactly he should replant the hedge, so to avoid any costly complications further down the line. But he claims St John's has refused to agree with him on the matter and says he has been forced to take the college to court, the Sunday Telegraph reported. The hedge, which dates back to 1686, divides Mr Bethell's one-acre plot from 1,200 acres of farmland owned by the college. Mr Bethell said: 'As it stands this ancient hedge is in a poor state of repair and is an eyesore. I'm more than happy to pay for the work to restore the hedge and improve and safeguard the rural environment around me, but I need St John's to agree the boundary line \u2013 and they just won't sit down and discuss the issue face to face. They've ignored all my approaches and left me with no choice but to go to court. 'I want to do this properly. If I went ahead and did the work without establishing where precisely the boundary lies I could end up creating all sort of problems which would see the college coming after me in future.' A crown court judge said the bushes were quickly becoming 'the most expensive hedge in Warwickshire' Mr Bethell claims St John's College (pictured) has refused to agree with him on the matter and says he has been forced to take the college to court . The retired businessman, who lives with his wife Eileen, 75, commissioned a report on the scrubby bushes, with experts recommending repairing the 'neglected, sparse' hedge. The report stated that fixing the hedgerow would encourage birds to nest, as well as providing habitats for other wildlife. Both Mr Bethell and St John's College have spent \u00a380,000 in legal fees in total, with the cost of a full trial likely to set the parties back \u00a3150,000. The huge sum led the judge overseeing the pre-trial hearing at Coventry Crown Court to suggest the bushes are quickly becoming 'the most expensive hedge in Warwickshire'. He reportedly said that both sides may as well 'pile up \u00a330,000 each in a field and light a huge bonfire'. Expensive: Both Mr Bethell and St John's College have spent \u00a380,000 in legal fees in total so far . Mr Bethell, who runs a charitable foundation for deprived children, is wary of the spiralling cost of the case, adding that the college could use the money to fund places for students. 'We could all save ourselves a lot of time if they would just sit down and talk about this simple matter of the boundary,' he said. The hedge is believed to have been planted in 1686 to divide two estates, which merged almost a century later when St John's bought the land.\u00a0The college now owns more than 9,000 acres of land in England. Professor Andrew Parker, the bursar of St John's College, Oxford,\u00a0said: 'The legal action and court proceedings have been initiated by Mr Bethell.

A big hit on the famous steeped terracing at La Bombonera as he followed in the footsteps of Diego Maradona, Claudio Cannigia and some of the other greats. Here in Turin he is worshipped at the Juventus Stadium, one of the idols in the shirt of the Bianconeri with that fearless, wholehearted approach to the game. Carlos Tevez (left) is worshipped by Juventus fans and has scored six Champions League goals this season . The Italian side are aiming to beat Monaco on Tuesday in their Champions League quarter-final first leg . On Tuesday evening, with six goals already in this season\u2019s Champions League, he will be expected to deliver in the first leg of the quarter-final against Monaco. Juve are already on course for the Serie A title, 12 points clear of nearest rivals Lazio ahead of their meeting in the league this weekend. First though, Massimiliano Allegri\u2019s team must find a way to beat Monaco, to secure a decent first-leg lead against the surprise quarter-finalists before the return in the Stade Louis II. At 31 Tevez appears to be enjoying his football again, helping Juventus to the title last season and leading the assault on the Champions League this term. Massimiliano Allegri is hoping to end 19 years of Champions League hurt by taking Juventus to glory . Monaco stand in Juventus' way; they were\u00a0adventurous and audacious in their win over Arsenal in the last 16 . It is easy to knock Italian football, to place it behind England, Spain and Germany, but to do that would do a great disservice to this Juventus team. There are some formidable talents in there, with Gianluigi Buffon protected in his goal by the tough, uncompromising presence of Giorgio Chiellini, Andrea Barzagli and Leonardo Bonucci in their three-man defence. The prolonged absence of Andrea Pirlo, who has made five appearances in this season\u2019s competition, has given others a chance to excel in the centre of this Juve midfield. Paul Pogba, one of the summer targets for Manchester United, is missing but Arturo Vidal, Roberto Pereyra and Claudio Marchisio all have pedigree. Tevez admits he feels free at Juventus, back to the days when he was playing for Boca Juniors (pictured) Monaco players train at the Juventus Stadium in Turin on the eve of their Champions League quarter-final . It has been 12 years since they last reached the Champions League final, when they were beaten by Milan on penalties during a dreadful stalemate that finished 0-0 at Old Trafford. For supporters of Juve it has been too long, with the shootout victory over Ajax in 1996 at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome a distant memory. They have won the European Cup twice and would dearly love a third. Standing in their way of a semi-final appearance is Monaco, the surprise team to make it through after their remarkable win over Arsenal in the previous round. At the Emirates, Leonardo Jardim\u2019s team were adventurous and audacious, surprising Arsenal with their breathtaking approach to the game. They are not to be underestimated. Gianluca Vialli lifts the Champions League for Juventus in 1996 - the last time the Bianconeri were victorious . In 2003, Juventus suffered heartbreak in the Champions League final, losing to AC Milan in a penalty shootout . Despite the big, high-profile exits of James Rodriguez to Real Madrid and Radamel Falcao\u2019s season-long loan to Manchester United, they are difficult to beat. Joao Moutinho is a classy player in the centre of their midfield and the France international Jeremy Toulalan can always pick out a pass. Up front is Dimitar Berbatov, one of the scorers at the Emirates on the night of that incredible and climactic 3-1 victory in the first leg. Dimitar Berbatov is one of the men standing in Juventus' way in their Champions League quarter-final .

Asked about a setback that may yet cost Brendan Rodgers and his players a place in next season\u2019s Champions League, the club\u2019s midfielder Joe Allen was rueful. \u2018They were ready to go and maybe we weren\u2019t,\u2019 Allen told a young supporter at Melwood this week. \u2018Yeah, maybe the rivalry can sometimes get in the way.\u2019 Joe Allen battles it out with Ander Herrera during Liverpool's Premier League defeat to Man United at Anfield . Liverpool midfielder Allen spoke to Sportsmail's Ian Ladyman at Liverpool's Melwood training ground . Midfielder Allen believes Liverpool have performed well against the big teams during the last two seasons . For Allen, and indeed for Liverpool, one suspects that their defeat by their greatest rival of all is already being viewed as merely another kink in the road. Certainly there is nobody at Anfield who will accept the opinion offered by Sky Sports\u2019 Gary Neville, the former United defender, that Liverpool froze. \u2018No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the problem,\u2019 said Allen. \u2018I think over the last two seasons we have performed against the big teams. Games can just be like that sometimes. It doesn\u2019t happen very often. Next time that game comes around we will get it right.\u2019 Over the past few months at Liverpool there has certainly been more right than wrong. Going into Saturday\u2019s game at Arsenal, they are five points off fourth place in the Barclays Premier League but that still represents progress from the dark days of autumn and early winter. Allen, one senses, has been integral to recent improvement. With captain Steven Gerrard no longer an automatic starter and the Brazilian Lucas Leiva recently injured, the 25-year-old midfielder has been given an extended opportunity to prove his worth. Allen has been given an opportunity  with captain Steven Gerrard no longer an automatic choice for Liverpool . While Gerrard is no longer the first name on the teamsheet, Lucas Leiva (left) has also been sidelined . Having arrived with Rodgers from Swansea in 2012, Allen could not always be relied on. He admitted this week that at times the challenge seemed a little too big for him but he hopes that recent performances in big victories against Manchester City, Southampton and Swansea will one day be seen as evidence of a genuine breakthrough. \u2018I think so, I hope so,\u2019 Allen told Sportsmail. \u2018Personally I have always been confident that I just needed games. \u2018I will be open and honest, though. In my first season there were moments when I look back and am disappointed about how I did cope with that [mental] aspect of things. \u2018Maybe I underestimated it a little bit before I came. I tried to anticipate it but you can\u2019t do it until you get here. Now I have come through that and the only issue this season has been injuries. Hopefully I can stay fit now and show people the best of me.\u2019 Allen\u2019s increased standing at Liverpool saw him selected for a meet and greet with supporters this week. Guest of honour was Sean Melia, a volunteer at the Anfield Sports Community Centre who was present at Melwood as a \u2018Barclays spirit of the game hero\u2019. During a 20-minute Q&A with a group of supporters, Allen talked openly about the sad feeling at the club when Gerrard announced that he would not be staying and the devastation of last season\u2019s title failure. \u2018We understand that we gave it to Manchester City,\u2019 he said. Allen admits, at times, the challenge of playing for Liverpool felt a little too big but has impressed recently . Gerrard consoles Luis Suarez as Liverpool's title hopes were dented against Crystal Palace last season . Allen also spoke of the feeling at the club after captain Gerrard announced he would be leaving the Reds . Later on, however, his conversation with Sportsmail was more personal and touched on his relationship with his older brother Harry, a talented footballer who plays for the Wales deaf side after losing his hearing to meningitis as a toddler. \u2018When we were younger, he was a striker and he was a better player than me,\u2019 revealed Allen. \u2018At primary school I played with him and his mates and that gave me a little bit of a head start as they were two years older. \u2018He is profoundly deaf but he speaks so well. I used to sign a little bit but he communicates so well now that I don\u2019t need to. \u2018Sibling rivalry is the perfect description of what we had, though. We loved playing against each other but there was a competitive edge to it. It\u2019s a while back but I guess that is where the path all started for me. \u2018It\u2019s hard to say whether he would have made it - it is something that I do wonder about. But going out on to the pitch profoundly deaf is a huge disadvantage. So I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s one of those that we will never know the answer to\u2026\u2019 Home these days for Allen is the house he shares in Chester with his wife Lacey and son Alfie. Inherently private, he was a little embarrassed when Lacey posted a photograph on Twitter of last year\u2019s birthday present. Then again a photograph of a top footballer holding a live chicken is rather unusual. Allen poses with a rooster bought for him by his wife for the Liverpool midfielder's 24th Birthday . Allen's wife, Lacey-Jo, shared the snap of Allen and his Birthday present on Twitter last year . Allen poses with Sean Melia, a volunteer at the Anfield Sports Community Centre who was present at Melwood as a \u2018Barclays spirit of the game hero\u2019 \u2018It was just a \u201cWhat do you get the guy who has everything?\u201d kind of present,\u2019 laughed Allen, fidgeting rather uncomfortably in his chair. \u2018My wife is a big animal lover and it was, yeah, my surprise present. It has got a name but I\u2019m not telling you! We already had a couple of chickens and this is a cockerel. That was the point of it really. In the dressing room, it\u2019s a bit of a random one. \u2018I keep my private life private and I guess that was a rare insight. We didn\u2019t realise what impact it would have but it was harmless enough.\u2019 Allen was rather more comfortable when the conversation returned to football and, in particular, Wales\u2019s weekend win in Israel that left Chris Coleman\u2019s team at the top of their qualifying group for Euro 2016.Allen was in Cardiff\u2019s Millennium Stadium in 2004 when Mark Hughes\u2019s team lost a play-off to Russia. Now he wants to make some history with his country and finish off the work started by one of his early national coaches, the late Gary Speed. Allen is keen to make history with Wales and finish the work started by former manager, the late Gary Speed . \u2018His presence is still there for everyone,\u2019 Allen said poignantly. \u2018He began this journey for us and his big dream was for us to qualify. In lots of ways we want to make sure we can do this for someone like Gary. \u2018He was a real people person. For a young midfielder going into the squad, he certainly had a huge impact on my career. \u2018It was a huge win for us in Israel and we have a great chance now. For me it was the perfect thing to happen after the Man United result. \u2018That\u2019s the beauty of football. There is always the next game to put things right.\u2019 Allen played in the 3-0 win over Israel which took Wales to their top of their Euro 2016 qualifying group . Domestically, Liverpool\u2019s opportunity to make amends begins at the Emirates tomorrow and continues in Lancashire next Wednesday with an FA Cup quarter-final replay at Blackburn. There is still much to aim for at Anfield this season and, with Gerrard suspended for three games, opportunity continues to knock for one of the next generation. \u2018Whatever happened in one game has gone,\u2019 said Allen. \u2018We can start another run and do it again. That has to be our belief and confidence now. \u2018Last season we had a similar run. We have to use that to inspire us. If the teams above us do slip up then we will be waiting.\u2019 Joe Allen was speaking at a Barclays event to inspire the next generation of fans to fall in love with the game.

Then came the admission that while Aidan, 31, very 'definitely' did not wear mascara to enhance his seductive stares, he was partial to a little eyeliner to define his smouldering eyes. Now, it seems eagle-eyed Poldark fans have a new question on their lips: just where has Aidan's chest hair gone? Scroll down for video . A good smattering! Has actor Aidan Turner, who has admitted to using baby oil to show off his physique to maximum effect, been 'manscaping' his once-hairy chest in favour of a less hirsute look? Definitely no 'scything' here...Aidan's chest hair looks distinctly more unkempt in this photo shoot for BBC comedy drama Being Human, which aired earlier this year . New images have emerged of the Irish star, whose brooding good looks have seen him capture a million hearts, looking a little more, shall we say, hirsute. In images shot to promote another BBC series Being Human, the actor, who is dating fellow rising Irish star Sarah Greene, appears to have a much thicker chest of hair, suggesting that he's done away with his natural rug in a bid to really show off the muscles underneath. Although it seems the BBC make-up department may have gone for a little gentle pruning rather than offering up the full, shaven reveal in a bid to stay true to the 18th century male grooming that Ross Poldark himself might have partaken in. It's unlikely that such a character would have reached for the razor, so a smattering of hair remains. Aidan's chest has been the subject of much viewer devotion throughout the series so far, thanks to the actor disrobing in plenty of scenes. Fans have taken to Twitter to comment on the latest Poldark male grooming debate. One viewer,\u00a0@AidanTurner_Fan, remarked that she would rather see her favourite star with a full rug: 'Asked to shave his chest hair off?!! I'd rather he had it all!' Scythed but not clean shaven? The brooding star has stubble but not the bearded look the actor appears to favour in real life . Still brooding but a more natural image: A bearded Aidan pictured with his girlfriend Sarah Greene at the premiere for The Hobbit back in 2014 .

And some got hot under the collar at the very thought of it. Tattooed_Mummy wrote on the social media site: 'I can't think of anything other than running my hands through Ross Poldark's chest hair.' The actor has confessed that he is 'inherently lazy' when it comes to perfecting his body beautiful and only really got in shape for Poldark as filming start dates approached. 'I worked hard for six weeks, killing myself in the gym, watching what I eat and staying away from bad food. But I would never, ever do all that if I wasn't prepping for a role.

{"question_id": 977, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)Would you build a house with water? Hungarian architect Matyas Gutai believes that water is the perfect material for keeping a house at a comfortable temperature. And while that doesn't mean that he can do away with traditional materials like bricks, cement, and plaster, his system promotes a whole new idea of engineering. Gutai built a prototype house in his hometown of Kecskemet, south of Budapest, with his high school friend Milan Berenyi, after years of research and development. The house was built with a grant from the EU, and showcases the \"liquid engineering\" concepts Gutai has written about extensively. Panels, some of steel, and some of glass, make up the structure of the house and a sheet of water is trapped between the inner layers, which equalizes the temperature across the building. The house is actually able to reheat itself, when its hot excess heat is stored either in the foundations of the building or in external storage, to be brought back to the walls when the temperature drops. The indoor temperature can also be modified using a monitoring system similar to central heating. This is a very efficient and sustainable system: the house can produce its own energy and be more independent of energy suppliers, which could reduce carbon emissions. \"Our panel can heat and cool the building itself -- the water inside the panel does the very same job as heating,\" says Gutai. \"It saves energy, when you compare it to a similar building with large glass surfaces -- it's a very clean and sustainable solution.\" While studying sustainable architecture at the University of Tokyo, in 2003, Gutai got the idea for his water house from a visit to the open air hot baths. Despite the snowfall outside the pool, Gutai remained comfortably warm inside it -- it was then he realized the importance of water's surface temperature and its potential use in architecture. \"As an architect I think it's really important that this building tries to redefine permanence, which has been a key concept in architecture for thousands of years. Our approach to permanence hasn't changed much at all, but now instead of making something very strong that tries to resist everything, we are making something that adapts to its environment. \"Architecture is really changing in our time. We've reached our limits when it comes to solid architecture, now it's reasonable to look for a new system.\" \"This research dates back seven or eight years,\" explains Gutai. \"I started it at the University of Tokyo and it took us almost six years to get the building done. There are plenty of structural problems involved -- a lot of important questions were raised such as what happens if it's so cold outside that the water freezes or what happens when one panel breaks.\" \"We now mix the water with natural solvents, that do not cause pollution but lower the freezing temperature to an acceptable level. This practically means, that even if the reheating technology fails, the water cannot freeze.\" \"In case of cold climates, like in Hungary, we also add some external insulation to the structure, to protect it from freezing.\" And if a panel were to break? \"We designed special joint units. The joint elements allow slow flow, but block faster flows,\" he explains. This means that if one panel breaks, it will be sealed from the remaining ones instantly. This effect is based on fluid dynamics, and not computers or monitoring system -- which minimizes the chance of failure. Gutai has worked in cooperation with universities and manufacturers to make sure the building is viable, and while the prototype house is only a small space (eight square meters in total) it demonstrates the power of this new technology. \"Our goal should be to use less energy and materials, and take cities off-grid as much as possible. The water house is one way to do that,\" said Gutai, who currently works as a researcher at Feng Chia University in Taiwan. Constructing houses in this way is moderately more expensive than traditional designs, but this prototype aims to slash our energy needs and Gutai is working with factories and companies across Europe on projects using this technology.

German detectives have been \u2018closely monitoring developments\u2019 in the \u00a360 million London case and are expected to make contact with Scotland Yard this week. In particular, they are keen to find out whether any DNA was recovered from the scene of the Easter weekend raid and, crucially, whether it matches forensic samples found in a tunnel used in a \u00a38.3 million robbery at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013. The culprits behind the Hatton Garden raid (pictured) may have carried out a similarly audacious burglary just two years earlier in Berlin, it has emerged . In a case which has strikingly similar traits to the \u00a360m heist in London, thieves targeted 294 security vaults during a break-in at the Volksbank in Steglitz, Berlin, in January 2013 . There has been speculation that the London robbers \u2013 who stole jewels and cash from 72 boxes at the Hatton Garden Safe Deposit centre \u2013 are from Eastern Europe. Meanwhile, it is believed the Volksbank raiders, who have never been caught, are Polish. One of the five-man gang left a book at the crime scene \u2013 a Polish translation of American Desperado, the autobiography of drug smuggler Jon Roberts. And wooden boards used for their 100ft tunnel were bought in Poland. Thomas Neuendorf, of Berlin Police, told The Mail on Sunday: \u2018We are very interested in the case in England and I\u2019m sure our investigators will get in touch\u2026 If DNA matching our samples is put into the Interpol database by Scotland Yard we will be immediately notified.\u2019 Suspects caught on CCTV during the London heist were also dressed as construction workers - a tactic used in the Berlin raid . In a similar fashion to the German heist, the burglars timed their raid over the Easter bank holiday, entering after the premises emptied on Thursday night and leaving on Easter Sunday . In the German case, the gang spent almost a year building their tunnel before drilling through the bank\u2019s 3ft-thick concrete walls. In London, the robbers used heavy-duty drills to bore holes into a reinforced 7ft-thick wall. In both cases, police are investigating the possibility of an insider helping the thieves. Scotland Yard declined to comment last night. Value of items taken, including jewels, said to be between \u00a360m and \u00a3200m.

{"question_id": 979, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: They are the peculiar concrete markings that have been spotted all across America, prompting hikers and travellers to wonder what on Earth they could mean and where they are pointing to. But these giant arrows, which can measure up to 70ft in length, are actually a forgotten remnant of a bygone age. Dotted among scrubland, placed in seemingly random spots, these huge arrows were once markers for early airmail flights across the US - forming the first land-based navigation system in the world. A huge concrete arrow is found in perfect condition in Bloomington,\u00a0Washington County, Utah . The Bloomnigton arrow was one of 102 found by retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith, who have travelled across the US to photograph the monuments . The concrete arrows were placed at the base of lit beacons near airways, showing pilots the direction they needed to fly in to reach the next stop-off to deliver mail. Airmail in the US began as early as 1911, with the first official flight departing\u00a0Petaluma, California, and arriving in Santa Rosa, California. As the flights got longer, with more frequent stop-offs, so the beacons and arrows were placed to help pilots on their way. Following World War One, the US Postal Service began to use surplus war planes for mail delivery and many were flown by former army pilots. The arrows define a moment in history at the beginning of the 21st century when the US Postal service began delivering air mail . Perfectly set against the snow-capped mountains of Nevada, this arrow was photographed in Golconda,\u00a0Humboldt County . Captured near the tiny town of Medicine Bow in Wyoming, this beacon was on the famous New York to San Francisco route . One of the most important flight routes and the first to be completed, stretched across the US from New York to San Francisco . The giant arrows started to be placed across the country, sometimes at 10-mile intervals, from 1924. Painted bright yellow and placed alongside beacon with a gas light at the top, the idea was that the markers could be seen for a distance of up to 10 miles so pilots could find their way. In the summer of 1924, they stretched from Wyoming to Ohio and by the following year, the arrows had reached New York. By 1929, the arrows could direct flights all the way across the width of America. The main New York to San Francisco air route stretched from New York to San Francisco, following the yellow concrete trail. Medicine Bow\u00a0town in Carbon County has a population of just 284 and was originally established due to the construction of a transcontinental railroad . Not all the arrows are in good condition, with each passing winter more cracks appear in the concrete, such as with this arrow in Mote, Nevada . Pumpernickle n Nevada has its own concrete arrow too, which one again is overlooked by the state's beautiful mountains . In the days before radio and satellite communications, the arrows were a way to ensure pilots could find their way, even in poor weather. While the arrows are now long-forgotten, with many lost forever, there are fans who, having stumbled upon an arrow or two in the countryside, have started mapping those concrete markers that have been left behind. Retired couple Brian and Charlotte Smith were sent an email which piqued their interest and have been hunting down the arrows ever since. The email playfully explained: 'Every so often, usually in the vast deserts of the American Southwest, a hiker or a backpacker will run across something puzzling: a large concrete arrow, as much as seventy feet in length, sitting in the middle of scrub-covered nowhere.' The couple say they have found 102 arrows so far and have set up their website Arrows Across America as part of their photography site dreamsmithphotos.com\u00a0so fellow fans can share their own pictures and help map where the remaining arrows are. The Smiths told MailOnline Travel: 'We have located 102 arrows or portions of arrows, some are badly deteriorated and not much is left. Arrowheads and ancient earth mounds have been discovered at Poverty Point, in Utah, but it also has a more recent concrete arrow . A beacon has survived in good condition in New Mexico (left) and at Cottage Grove in Oregon (right) - many of these were lost as the metal was used in the war effort during the Second World War . At Thayer Juntion, in Wyoming, there are boards that supply information about the arrows and their use to passers-by . 'Our interest grew out of an email circulating in August 2013, we wanted to know where they were, and set out to find them. 'We have managed to take photos of approximately 40, and have a trip planned this fall to take more photos of some that we were unable to get to last spring. 'Eventually we hope to have photos of all the arrows that we have located, but time and money will dictate how long that will take us. 'Before our research we knew nothing about airways, beacons or concrete arrows, it has been a marvelous journey of discovery and we cannot believe that all of this has been \"forgotten.\"'.\n"]}

The sister of murdered schoolgirl Lindsay Jo Rimer has spoken of her family's agony as they still hope to find her killer 20 years after her death. Lindsay Jo was 13 when she went missing after going to the shops in Hebden Bridge, West Yorkshire. Her body was discovered in Rochdale canal five months later, weighed down with a 20lb rock. The teenager's sister Kate described her family's struggle since Lindsay Jo's death as a 'life sentence'. She has spoken out for the first time as detectives launch a new bid to find Lindsay Jo's killer as they admit they are still searching for the 'golden nugget' to bring justice to her family. Ms Rimer said: 'I was 20 at the time and still remember when mum called me to say my little sister was missing. I felt instantly that something was wrong. 'And then five months later she was found. 'From the beginning we have been filled with grief and we cannot stop the grief and instead remember her with love until this comes to an end. 'We miss her so much but every memory of her is tainted - it is so painful and bleeds into everything we do.' Ms Rimer, who now lives on the south coast, decided to speak out in a video as the 20th anniversary of when her sister's body was found approaches this Sunday. She added:\u00a0'It is about time this came to an end - it is a life sentence for this family. Ms Rimer said when her own daughter started school a teacher, who had also moved to the south from Bradford, asked if she had any connection to the Lindsay Jo case because of her surname. Scroll down for video . 'She had to say that Lindsay would have been her auntie,' said Ms Rimer. Lindsay Jo was last seen in Hebden Bridge on November 7 1994. She left her home on Cambridge Street to go to the shops and paused briefly at the Trades Club on Holme Street where she met her mother before buying cornflakes at the Spar shop. As the 20th anniversary of her sister's body being found approaches, Kate Rimer speaks about the struggle the family have faced as Lindsay Jo's killer has not been found for two decades . CCTV from the shop on Crown Street shows her buying the cornflakes at 10.22pm. It is not known what happened to her then. Her body was found in the Rochdale Canal on April 12 1995. Detective Superintendent Simon Atkinson, from West Yorkshire Police, said previous publicity has helped generate new leads and they are hopeful that they may be able to find fresh clues as to the identity of her killer. But he said: 'We are, however, still waiting for that one 'golden nugget' of information that will finally crack the case and bring closure to Lindsay's grieving family. 'Anyone who watches the clip of Kate's interview will be moved by what she has to say. It is clear that the pain still runs as deep as it did 20 years ago and nothing will ever completely erase the memory but bringing Lindsay's killer to justice will at least bring some closure to the family. 'Someone somewhere knows what happened to Lindsay and I am appealing again, directly, to that person to come forward and help me solve the case. CCTV from 1994 show Lindsay Jo walking along the aisles of the Spar shop where she bought cornflakes . 'For 20 years Lindsay's family have had to live with the pain and the hurt of not knowing what happened to her as her killer continues to enjoy their liberty.' The officer said: 'All we know is that Lindsay's body was found five months later on Wednesday April 12 1995, with the ultimate indignity to her and to her family that her body was left to rot in a watery grave. 'Someone prepared to do this doesn't deserve any protection. It is time they were brought to justice.' Two years ago a church minister and his parishioners urged police to investigate any links with prolific paedophile Jimmy Savile, who used to stay in a caravan in Cragg Vale - close to where Lindsay Jo lived in Hebden Bridge and previously at Lower Rough Head Farm. Savile would stay at Cragg Vale, just miles from where Lindsay Jo Rimer lived, first at Lower Rough Head Farm, then Hebden Bridge .\n"]}

VanZant, at only 21 and with just five fights behind her, has already ruffled feathers after being one of a select few to sign an individual contract with Reebok. And Herrig was clearly riled during the traditional staredown in Times Square. Felice Herrig and Paige VanZant face off during the  weigh-in .

At 21, VanZant has been hyped as the UFC's next big thing despite only having fought five times . She said: 'I think I'm a better striker than Paige, a better grappler than Paige, I have a better submission skill set than Paige, I'm stronger than Paige and more athletic than Paige so I believe I'll be able to take the fight wherever I want to. 'I'm glad Paige has a lot of hype around her because I feel when I beat her it will make the victory that much sweeter and feel that much more rewarding and it will make people respect me more.' At only 21 and with just five professional fights to her name, VanZant has enjoyed a spectacular rise since her first bout in 2012. After three wins and a decision defeat, she was signed by the UFC for the newly-formed 115lb division and initially selected to appear on the Ultimate Fighter. But due to her being under 21 at the time, she was unable to take part and instead made her debut against Kailin Curran last November, stopping the 24-year-old in the third and final round. 'It's very surreal,' VanZant said. 'Even the fact I'm part of the UFC is a huge experience. It's a blessing and I don't think it will set in for a very long time. VanZant admitted it feels surreal to be part of the UFC having made her debut aged 20 . VanZant works out in the week of her next fight, against Herrig in New Jersey on Saturday night . VanZant made a winning start to her UFC career, stopping\u00a0Kailin Curran in the third round . 'We were backstage at one of the other weigh-ins and someone threw it out, would you fight Felice Herrig and I said yeah and took the fight right away. 'I'm very excited about the match-up, stylistically it's a good one for me. 'As of right now, the only thing on my mind is winning this fight. I hope to win every fight the UFC offers me and see where this crazy journey can take me'. VanZant has a realistic chance of becoming the UFC's youngest-ever champion. That record belongs to light-heavyweight Jon Jones who won the title in 2011 aged 23. 'Obviously, that would be huge, and that would be awesome; I try not to think about it and try not to focus on setting records,' she told MMAjunkie. 'I strictly want to beat every opponent I face whether it's for a title or for a small show. The only thing for me is winning my fights and being the best athlete I can be.' Victory for VanZant will take her closer to a title shot as she bids to become the youngest-ever champion .\n"]}
{"question_id": 984, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: All the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics . Out on the election campaign trail under blue skies in South Wales, the trade union firebrand's manner was as warm as the weather. 'Didn't you once call me a slab-faced Marxist?' the famously militant leader of Unite asked me with a grin that was more genial than menacing. I had to confess I had. But that did not stop 'Red' Len McCluskey giving me the time of day on a street in Neath as he conducted a two-day tour of the Principality to drum up support for Labour's cause. Watching him in action, it was clear that he is highly popular with activists. His gospel of traditional hard-left socialism goes down well with the converted, as does his hackneyed anti-Conservative bile. 'We look to Wales as a beacon of hope to show what a Labour government can do. The Tories might have the money but we've got the working people on our side,' he said to cheers and applause. Yet all the smiles cannot hide the reality that McCluskey and his union are a potent, sinister force in British politics, seeking to use their financial and organisational muscle within the Labour movement to drag Britain back to the dark days of the 1970s. As the Mail reveals today, the sheer scale of the influence Unite holds on scores of Labour candidates is chilling given the socialist revolution the union would seek to impose. Indeed, McCluskey, a former Liverpool dock worker who keeps a drawing of Lenin in his office and once boasted of presiding over more strikes than any other union boss, is quite open about his yearning for that period when the unions held the government to ransom: 'We are supposed to believe that the Seventies was a horrible time. It wasn't. It was a time of great advances for working people,' he has said. Labour's umbilical link to McCluskey's union has received much less attention in recent days than a potential deal with the left-wing, anti-austerity SNP, yet it is just as potentially disastrous for the governance of this country. Not only is Unite \u2013 which has a claimed membership of 1.42million \u2013 intertwined with the Labour Party's structure, MPs and finances, but it also remains addicted to the failed socialist policies of the past, including a major expansion in the public sector, less flexibility in the workplace, higher taxation and ever more state spending. Just like Nicola Sturgeon, McCluskey wants to make Labour bolder, 'more radical, courageous and brave'. Only last month, he appeared to threaten illegal action if a Tory Government pushed through further restrictions on strikes in the public sector. 'When the law is misguided, when it oppresses people and removes their freedoms, can we respect it? I am not really posing the question, I'm giving the answer. It ain't going to happen,' he declared. Despite all his talk about the oppression of working people, however, he has not done badly for himself. Last year it was revealed he received a \u00a35,000 rise, taking his pay and pensions package to \u00a3140,281. McCluskey has denied that he has too much influence over Ed Miliband, adding that Unite is supporting the party '100 per cent' McCluskey's determination to influence Labour was all too evident in Wales. With an air of quasi-regal grandeur, he visited several factories, gave talks to Labour activists and held a number of photo opportunities \u2013 including one in Cardiff at the statute of that old champagne socialist Nye Bevan. When I spoke to McCluskey, he downplayed his hardline socialism, instead talking about the need for investment in industry and the economy. And he denied that he had too much influence over Ed Miliband's party: 'If only that were true,' he said, while proclaiming his loyalty to the cause. 'Unite is supporting Labour 100 per cent,' he said, adding that is now campaigning 'all over the country'. Yet there was something synthetic about McCluskey's protestations of support for Labour. As I watched him at close quarters, it became more apparent that he was going through the motions. When asked in an interview with BBC Radio Wales about Miliband's leadership, McCluskey could say only: 'He's doing OK'. Beneath the surface, I have no doubt he longs to hear Ed offering more nakedly socialist policies, rather than trying to appeal to Middle England. Moreover, if Labour and Unite really think that McCluskey is an asset in the election, they are doing their best to keep quiet about it. When I tried to find out McCluskey's schedule for his Welsh visit from any number of Unite and Labour sources, including McCluskey's own press officer, I was greeted with either hostility or silence. No one would give me any information. It was only through persistence and good luck that I managed to track him down, to the outrage of his press officer who asked me paranoiacally: 'How did you find us? Did you fit a tracking device to Len's car?' That kind of anxiety and suspicion shows more than just a lack of confidence. It reveals a fear that, just as with Sturgeon's spendthrift radicalism, the hard-Left dogma of Unite is likely to alienate floating middle-of-the-road voters. Such fears are, of course, only too justified. For this is no small-town demagogue. On the contrary, McCluskey is pivotal to Labour's future because of the stranglehold his union has over the party. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David, who enjoyed greater popularity among Labour MPs and the rank and file. Since 2010, Unite is estimated to have donated at least \u00a314.4million to Labour's coffers. It was Unite and the other affiliated unions that ensured Ed Miliband (pictured left) was elected leader in 2010 against his more moderate brother David (right) The dominance of Unite runs right through Labour's organisation, with huge implications for the make-up of a putative Miliband government. One recent analysis showed that 159 Labour MPs from the last parliament receive sponsorship from Unite or are members of the union, including senior frontbenchers such as Harriet Harman, Angela Eagle, Hilary Benn and Sadiq Khan. In addition, 133 Labour candidates at this election are reported to have links to Unite. As Martin Mayer, chairman of Unite's political committee and a member of Labour's National Executive recently admitted, the union is involved in a 'serious attempt to win back the party'. Tragically for Britain, there is now a real danger that an incoming Labour government would be forced to lurch even further to the Left, not just by SNP by also by Unite, with Miliband too weak to stand up to those who are determined he will be their puppet in Downing Street.\n"]}

A voyeur who used a hidden camera to film up women's skirts as they bent over freezers in Lidl has been spared jail. James Webster targeted\u00a0female shoppers at the Lidl store in Maidenhead, Berkshire, as they hunted for bargains in the large chest freezers. The 35-year-old was caught after attracting the attention of a fellow shopper, who spotted him moving the bag he was carrying closer to his unsuspecting victim. Security guards discovered Webster had cut a hole in the bag through which he placed the lens of a camera so he could carry out his covert filming. He admitted outraging public decency at a previous hearing and was warned that he could face prison. But Webster walked free from court after magistrates sitting in Slough, Berkshire, ordered him to complete a sexual offences treatment programme, as part of a three year community order. Opening the case, Helen Gambrill said: 'On January 12 the defendant was in Lidl in Maidenhead and outraged the public decency, namely filming up the skirts of women in that store. 'That offence came to light when a member of the public saw the defendant and thought he was acting in a strange way.' The court heard the shopper spotted Webster positioning his satchel, with a lens protruding out, under the skirt of a woman. Webster, who at the time was living in shared accommodation in White Waltham, near Maidenhead, was confronted by security guards and tried to cover the lens before denying any wrong-doing. However, after seeing an appeal for witnesses to the crime in a local newspaper he turned himself in to police. Webster  immediately showed remorse, telling a police officer, 'I threw the camera away in frustration on the day I did this.' He accepted that his actions had a sexual purpose but admitted he had no idea why he had carried out the crime. Francis Domingo, defending, said Webster had been struggling to deal with a break-up at the time and was incredibly ashamed at his actions. 'From the moment I've seen him, I can tell you this - Mr Webster has expressed nothing but sincere remorse over what took place,' he said. Webster, now of Fengate, Marsham, near Norwich, had been smoking cannabis around the time of the incident, but was now clean, the court was told. Webster had targeted women as the shopped at Lidl in Maidenhead, Berkshire (pictured) Sentencing him, Presiding magistrate Mark Lovett said: 'We note the early guilty plea and the fact that you were very upfront about it from the very beginning. 'You were remorseful for your actions. 'On the other hand, you did show obvious intention - you went equipped. This was hardly accidental.' He added: 'The other point I have to make is that you're not 18, you're 35, for goodness sake. 'That kind of action from someone of your mature years is quite extraordinary.' Webster was handed a three year community order  and was ordered to take part in a sexual offences treatment programme. He was also told to pay \u00a385 in costs and a \u00a360 fine.\n"]}

Laut claims she wrestled a gun from her abusive husband after he became intoxicated and said he was going to kill her after he killed their 10-year-old son and their dogs . Her attorney Ron Bamieh called the prosecution's move 'unprofessional' and 'pretty much unprecedented' in a murder case. 'Complete chicken s***. It's just complete chicken s*** practice of law,'\u00a0Bamieh said outside the courtroom. Her husband, who won a bronze medal in the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, was shot several times in the head on the night of August 28, 2009 in their yard in Oxnard, a coastal city 60 miles northwest of Los Angeles. He was declared dead at the scene. Jane Laut's attorney called it a 'self-defense case,' apparently contradicting police reports of her statements at the time of the killing. They were high school sweethearts and married for 29 years. Jane Laut had told investigators immediately after the shooting that he went to the backyard to check out suspicious sounds, and she heard shots fired, police said. Police initially said Laut may have been killed by prowlers, but a few days later said the killing was not random. Bamieh, who was hired by Jane Laut shortly after the killing, told the Ventura County Star after the arrest that she wrestled the gun from an abusive husband after he became intoxicated and said he was going to kill her after he killed their 10-year-old son and their dogs. 'She was left with no choice but to defend herself and her child with that gun,' Bamieh told the newspaper. 'It's not a question of who the shooter was, it's a question of the intent of the shooter.' Laut's trial had already been postponed multiple times. When the judge denied a motion from the prosecution that the trial be continued until June, prosecutors chose to drop the charges and refile. Deputy District Attorney Rameen Minoui said his witnesses would not be available for trial in the current window, People reported, and he accused the defense of withholding discovery.

He added: 'Marine Le Pen may want me dead, that's possible, but she must not count on my co-operation.' In an interview on Wednesday, Mr Le Pen flamed allegations of anti-Semitism by praising the wartime leader Marshall Phillippe Petain, who collaborated with the Nazis. Mr Le Pen also said that France's Spanish-born Socialist Prime Minister was an 'immigrant' and so unfit to run the country.

Furious with her father's latest outburst, his daughter said she would oppose his candidacy in December elections to lead the southeastern Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region.

'The FN doesn't want to be held hostage to his vulgar provocations,' said Ms Le Pen, adding: 'His aim is to harm.' Denier: Mr Le Pen is known for his anti-semitic views, and was found guilty of Holocaust denial in 2008 . In an interview with Rivarol magazine, Mr Le Pen stood by his gas chambers remark, saying: 'I am not the type of man who changes his mind or crawls.' In a poll published last year, 83 per cent of French described Mr Le Pen as a handicap to his daughter as she fights to become president in 2017.

Passenger Jin Pai, 35, was standing on the rim of a toilet when it collapsed, leaving him hospitalised . The smashed up toilet in\u00a0Hefei Xinqiao International Airport in the city of Hefei . But he was caught out when the porcelain toilet then tipped over and shattered on the floor, cutting the man in several places. The injured man was found bleeding on the toilet floor after he had telephoned his travelling companions for help. He had been too embarrassed to shout for help and had hoped they would assist but he was too badly hurt for anything other than an immediate trip to hospital. Authorities and emergency personnel arrived to check the man into a Hefei hospital, where he received several dozens stitches on his left leg and buttocks. Then man broke the toilet in Hefei Xinqiao International Airport in the city of Hefei . The passenger reportedly confessed to his friends that he was squatting on the toilet, but later changed his story to the police, possibly to avoid paying compensation, and said he was sitting when the poorly built toilet gave way. Authorities said they believed the incident was an accident. Police spokesman Bo Chiang said: 'In any case, we would like to remind people that these toilets are for sitting on, not for standing on.'\n"]}

Monsour Alshammari, 27, is in the U.S. on a Saudi government student sponsorship and has ties to the country's royal family, according to court documents. He was picked up by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Friday and a judge in Provo signed an arrest warrant on Monday to extradite him back to Utah. Monsour Alshammari, 27, was arrested on Friday at the border near San Diego. He is set to be extradited back to Utah where he faces charges related to the rape of a student in February . Alshammari had been charged on April 3 with rape, a first-degree felony, and obstructing justice, a second-degree felony. He has not yet entered a plea to those charges. Prosecutors believe Alshammari was attempting to flee the country with no concern for the $100,000 someone posted for his bail. He is being held at a facility in San Diego until he can be extradited to Utah. Orem police Lt. Craig Martinez said that process could take several weeks. Utah police said in court documents that they want Alshammari held without bail in Utah because they believe his international connections and willingness to walk away from $100,000 bail mean he'll flee the country to avoid prosecution. 'If you are bailing out, you are not supposed to leave the state \u2013 let alone the country,' Deputy Utah County Attorney Craig Johnson told KSL.com. 'If he had been successful, there is no way for us to extradite him back to Utah \u2013 especially with his ties to the royal family.' Alshammari was arrested in March, nearly a month after a woman reported to police she had been raped, while on a date. The victim led police to Alshammari at this apartment complex near Utah Valley University. He was booked into the Utah County jail on March 26, but $100,000 in bail was posted for him five days later. Alshammari's attorney Ron Yengich declined to comment on Tuesday, saying he had not talked with his client since the arrest. When asked about Alshammari's connections to the Saudi Arabian royal family, Yengich said he would not speak about any relationship or connections due to attorney client privilege. Police did not offer details about the royal connection, besides saying that federal officials reported Alshammari is related to royalty and has family connections to the Saudi Arabian government.\n"]}

Other stars include boy band Blue, R&B singer Jamelia, pop star Pixie Lott, jazz vocalist Gregory Porter and tenor Alfie Boe. The 1940s-themed concert will take place on Saturday 9 and will be broadcast on BBC1, hosted by Chris Evans. The singers will be joined by four Strictly Come Dancing couples and readings from Pointless host Alexander Armstrong and Absolutely Fabulous actress Jane Horrocks. The extensive commemoration is a victory for the Daily Mail which highlighted growing concerns that the anniversary risked being overshadowed by the election on May 7. Singer Dame Vera Lynn, the 98-year-old Forces\u2019 Sweetheart, was among those who called on the Government to do more to mark the occasion. It is likely to be the last major anniversary which will be attended in strength by the generation that fought at home and abroad during the war. David Cameron asked Cabinet minister William Hague in February to draw up plans for three days of national commemorations and last month Chancellor George Osborne earmarked up to \u00a32million in the Budget towards marking the event. The timing of the anniversary makes it even more of an extraordinary occasion, starting the day after a general election which is likely to result in another hung Parliament. The 1940s-themed concert will also include readings from Pointless host Alexander Armstrong (left) and Absolutely Fabulous actress Jane Horrocks (right) Ministers and their shadows are likely to gather for celebrations not knowing for sure who will be in power of the country after coalition negotiations. The three-day commemoration will begin with a Service of Remembrance on VE Day (May 8) at The Cenotaph and a national two-minute silence at 3pm, marking the moment Winston Churchill broadcast his historic speech formally announcing the end of the war in 1945. A chain of more 100 beacons will be lit across the country in the evening. Ahead of the star-studded concert on the Saturday, sports fans will honour the day with clapping and singing during fixtures and cathedrals are encouraged to ring their bells in celebration at 11am.

Shauna McGlasson, 25, from Workington, was so overweight she got trapped in the turnstiles at the Alice And Wonderland ride at Blackpool Pleasure Beach in August last year. Shauna, who was a takeaway addict, was carrying her three-year-old daughter Lacey in her arms at the time and the toddler started screaming after her mother tried to free herself. Shauna\u00a0McGlasson was left red faced after becoming trapped in the turnstiles of the Alice and Wonderland ride when she took her daughter Lacey (pictured) to Blackpool Pleasure Beach after ballooning to 17st . It was this embarrassing incident that inspired the mother-of-one to make a dramatic change to her diet and exercise routine losing 7st in as many months . This was the final straw for the full-time mum who had been left battling depression and anxiety after gorging on fast-food and ballooning to 17 stone. Determined Shauna has since dropped seven stone and now weighs in at just over 10 stone. Shauna made fast progress as she began to eat healthily, she lost four stone in as many months reaching 13st by December, 2014. She then hit the gym and shifted another three stone and has started a new relationship with boyfriend Curtis Grayson, 21. Before shedding the weight Shauna battled with depression because of her size . And 5ft 2in Shauna insists she's never been happier. She says if she had not got stuck in that ride her life would never have changed for the better. 'I was addicted to takeaways and I've never felt so low,' she said. 'When we got to go through to the ride I got stuck in the turnstile and Lacey started crying. 'Everyone was looking at me and I felt so humiliated so I had to do something about it. 'You can see in the photo taken when I finally got out just how upset Lacey is.' Shauna swapped her daily treats of chips and pizza for a high protein diet of chicken and fish . Shauna is now a regular at the gym going up to five times a week with running being her workout of choice . Before her weight loss Shauna would feast on fish and chips on the daily as well as donner meat pizzas but has now traded them in for a 1,500 calorie-a-day diet of chicken and fish. As well as her change in diet Shauna heads to the Energize ladies gym in Workington for an hour a day, up to five times a week, tackling the treadmill and the cross-trainer in her bid to keep fit. Shauna says that it was taking to the treadmill that really helped her to shift her extra pounds. 'I look at the pants I used to wear and they are like a tent - and they used to be tight, I could barely get into them,' she said. Shauna is now more confident than ever and is even prepared to take Lacey swimming . 'I can't believe I used to wear stuff that big. But I started walking on the treadmill at first and I've gradually got faster until the point that I was running and it's made a big difference.' And the change has boosted her confidence so much that she is prepared to even take Lacey swimming for the first time. Shauna said: 'I've never been able to take Lacey swimming before because I've been too conscious of my body to wear a swimsuit. 'I'm excited to finally take her to the pool. 'I don't think she's noticed the difference in me as she sees me everyday but I'm so much happier and much more active now. I feel great.'\n"]}

Mohammed Alam, Sayed Juied and Sadek Miah treated burglary 'like a job, a profession,' raiding houses in affluent west London, Herfordshire and Surrey. Over the course of 11 months the gang broke into 21 homes, taking a Ferrari, Porches, Minis, paintings and cash worth \u00a31million, often waiting until home owners were on holiday before striking. Sayed Juied, 32, and\u00a0Sadek Miah, 31,  were jailed for six years each after admitting to raiding 21 muti-million pound homes in west London, Hertfordshire and Surrey . The gang were undeterred by security systems, officers said, instead viewing them as a sign a property was worth raiding. If they found that valuables were locked in a safe inside, they would simply cut the safe out, before cracking it open later. Officers first began hunting the group in July last year after a raid on a \u00a32.6million house in Somerset Road, Wimbledon, next door to the Lawn Tennis Association. Mohammed Alam, 26, was give five years. Police said the gang treated robbery as 'a profession', surveying properties before they struck . The raiders smashed in a back window before ransacking the property, taking keys to a \u00a330,000 Porsche Cayenne and a \u00a320,000 Mini Cooper, along with \u00a313,000 of jewellery and electrical items. The house was so badly damaged the owners also had to foot a \u00a313,000 repair bill. A week later the gang struck two neighbouring homesin Putney, including one \u00a34.6million house, taking jewellery worth \u00a338,700, and a Porsche Cayenne worth \u00a375,000. Continuing their all-night burglary spree, they hit another Putney home  where they stole a personalised Ferrari worth \u00a3280,000, a matching Cayenne worth \u00a3130,000, and a painting worth nearly \u00a350,000. Jewellery worth \u00a38,600 was taken along with \u00a31,400 in foreign notes was taken from a house in Kingston Hill during another raid in July. In another burglary in Kingston Hill last July, the back patio doors were forced open while the homeowners were away and the alarm system was smashed. Jewellery worth \u00a38,600 was taken along with \u00a31,400 in foreign currency. Three homes in Arthur Road, Wimbledon, were targeted between December 2013 and July last year, with damage caused to front doors and property worth \u00a3500 taken during one raid. Police tracked the trio after staff at the All England Club, home to the Wimbledon tennis championships, caught their car on CCTV. They passed the details to the Metropolitan Police, who found that the car had been rented by Alam, 26, from Unxbridge, who had used his real name. That in turn led them to Juied,\u00a032, and Miah,\u00a031, both from Maida Vale, west London. When police arrested the trio they found multiple Google searches on their computers on how to disable alarm systems and CCTV, and how to crack open safes. The gang took cars, cash, jewellery, electricals and paintings worth a total of \u00a31million over the course of 11 months. Among their haul were two Porche Cayennes (pictured) worth a total of \u00a3205,000 . During one raid at a \u00a32.6million opposite the All England Lawn Tennis Association in Wimbledon, the raiders made off with a \u00a320,000 Mini Cooper (pictured) along with a Porsche, cash and jewels . The gang admitted conspiring to commit the burglaries, and were jailed for a total of 17 years at Kingston Crown Court on Wednesday. Alam was given five years behind bars, while Juied and Miah were both given six-year prison terms. Detective Sergeant Dan Mitchell, from Merton burglary team, said: 'They would conduct reconnaissance on big detached houses in really affluent neighbourhoods and then break in. 'They were quite an unusual team, they were not deterred at all by CCTV and alarm systems, that's how they thought somewhere was a worthwhile target. 'They would smash the alarm box as soon as they got in. They would go straight for the safe and try and take the whole safe out, the main thing they wanted was cash. 'They were treating it as a job, a profession. They're the most professional team I have worked on.'\n"]}

Ed Miliband will today claim Labour\u2019s attitude to immigration has \u2018changed\u2019 \u2013 despite still refusing to put any upper limit on the numbers allowed in. In an audacious move, the Labour leader will insist that he offers a \u2018clear, credible and concrete plan on immigration \u2013 not false promises\u2019. He will say: \u2018We will deal with people\u2019s concerns because we have listened, we have learned and we have changed.\u2019 But, only hours before the key election speech was due to be delivered, his own shadow home secretary refused at least four times to say Labour would put a target on net immigration. Under intense pressure during a home affairs debate on the BBC\u2019s Daily Politics Show, Yvette Cooper would say only she wanted the number to be lower than the current 300,000. Presenter Andrew Neil had pointed out that, in office, Labour had \u2018virtually opened the door\u2019 to record migration. During Labour\u2019s 13 years in power, the foreign-born population rocketed by 3.6million. Home Secretary Theresa May, trading blows with Ms Cooper in the debate, said: \u2018The choice is clear. Back to a Labour Home Office which they admitted was not fit for purpose, or the Conservatives, who have a plan to reform free movement, cut immigration, defeat extremism and keep cutting crime.\u2019 The Tories are fighting the election on a commitment to reduce net migration to the \u2018tens of thousands\u2019. Speaking in the Vale of Glamorgan today, Mr Miliband will claim that Labour would implement a ten-point plan for curbing immigration during its first 100 days in office. It includes recruiting an additional 1,000 border staff, banning recruitment agencies from hiring only from overseas and making it illegal for employers to undercut wages by exploiting workers. However, the Tories are likely to point out that a number of the proposals are already in the process of being implemented. They include the introduction of full exit checks to count people in and out of the country and \u2018stopping those who have committed serious crimes coming to Britain\u2019. Mr Miliband is expected to say: \u2018David Cameron once promised to cut net immigration to tens of thousands \u2013 and told us to kick him out of office if he didn\u2019t deliver. But, only hours before the key election speech was due to be delivered, his own shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper (pictured) refused at least four times to say Labour would put a target on net immigration . Union boss Len McCluskey last night hailed Ed Miliband as Britain\u2019s next prime minister and said the country stood on the \u2018brink of change\u2019. The Unite general secretary praised Labour for a series of \u2018radical\u2019 policies, including the \u2018freeze\u2019 on energy prices, the mansion tax and the 50p income tax rate. And he praised Mr Miliband for planning to repeal \u2018some of the worst anti-union\u2019 laws with a commission headed by John Monks, the former TUC general secretary. Addressing a rally of trade unionists in London, Mr McCluskey, whose union is Labour\u2019s biggest donor, said: \u2018Our nation stands on the brink of change. \u2018In ten days the people will cast their vote. They will pass their judgment on the last five years of Tory coalition, on the Labour Party and on Ed Miliband \u2013 as our leader and our next Prime Minister.\u2019 He said Labour offered \u2018something different\u2019 and told the audience: \u2018Is it radical enough? You judge for yourself.\u2019 Labour would \u2018end bogus self-employment and put a stop to the zero-hour contracts that have become a stain on our nation,\u2019 Mr McCluskey added. \u2018On tax they\u2019re going to tackle non-doms, a 50p tax rate for those who can afford it, a mansion tax and above all tackling tax avoidance.\u2019 He said David Cameron\u2019s pledge to \u2018finish the job\u2019 of deficit reduction were \u2018perhaps the scariest words in the English language\u2019. Last week Mr McCluskey was caught boasting that trade unions \u2018own\u2019 the Labour Party and its policies. In the Unite magazine he wrote: \u2018The Labour Party is our party, we built it, to serve us. These are our policies. They are now within our grasp.\u2019 \u2018But net migration rose to 298,000 last year, almost exactly three times higher than he promised. Nothing damages people\u2019s faith in politics more than broken promises like that \u2013 or those he is still making today. 'I will only make promises I can keep. I won\u2019t offer false targets or seek to exploit concerns with the politics of fear. Instead, I am offering clear, credible and concrete ways of making a real difference.\u2019 He will add: \u2018Immigration is too important an issue for our country to be abandoned by the Prime Minister so it can be exploited by Nigel Farage.\u2019 Last week, David Cameron made a passionate plea to Ukip voters not to risk letting in a Labour government that will allow \u2018a return to uncontrolled immigration\u2019. Writing exclusively for the Daily Mail, he said he understood people\u2019s \u2018fears and worries\u2019 about immigration. It followed a poll showing six in ten are unhappy with the Government\u2019s record. Mr Cameron wrote: \u2018Do you honestly think Ed Miliband cares about controlling immigration? No. \u2018He was there the last time, remember, when net immigration increased fivefold.\u2019 Mr Miliband has apologised for the calamitous underestimate of the number of Eastern Europeans who would arrive in Britain when the EU\u2019s border\u2019s expanded eastwards in 2004. But he refuses to accept that unprecedented levels of non-EU migration were a mistake. One ex-Labour adviser notoriously said the party\u2019s aim was to \u2018rub the Right\u2019s nose in diversity\u2019. \u25a0 ED Miliband has revealed that a Labour government would legalise humanist weddings. The move could lead to a clamour for other unconventional unions, including Jedi and Druid marriages, to be given the same status as traditional weddings. Mr Miliband told Pink News his government would look to give the controversial ceremonies the same status as religious and civil unions. There was widespread support for humanist marriage across Parliament during the passage of the Equal Marriage Act, including from Labour. \u2018We still support the legal recognition of humanist marriages and we\u2019ll review the law,\u2019 said Mr Miliband. The UK\u2019s first pagan wedding took place last month in Scotland.\n"]}
{"question_id": 998, "category": "summarization", "turns": ["Summarize: (CNN)It's easy to be anxious about the threat posed by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. After all, this is a brutal organization that not only kills but seems to revel in doing so in ways designed to shock the world -- from the beheadings of journalists to burning a Jordanian pilot alive. Such moves are part of this murky group's propaganda and its deliberate efforts to manipulate information. So what can and should we make of the organization? I explore the issue in depth in a special airing Sunday night. And although it's important to start with the caveat that ISIS is indeed trying to scare and confuse us, I took away some tentative lessons from speaking with the people who have traveled inside the minds of ISIS. First, ISIS is clearly about religion -- its version of radical Islam -- but it is also about power. There is increasing evidence that the military backbone of ISIS is made up not by a group of Islamic zealots, but rather high-ranking officers from Saddam Hussein's army -- Baathists who were at least ostensibly secular. An internal ISIS report detailing its organizational structure was reported on last week in the German weekly Der Spiegel. That report describes a group that uses its religious ideology as a recruiting and governing philosophy, much like communism. But underneath it, much like communism, is simply a drive for control, a lust for power. Next, ISIS presents itself as a global organization, but it has thrived because of a local cause. The group has gained territory, cash and recruits primarily because of the rage and rebellion of the Sunnis of Iraq and Syria, who believe they must fight the Shiites to secure their own survival and strength. The reality is that that Sunni cause is going to endure for some time. The United States has been successful in its tactical battles against ISIS and has managed to push the group back from many of its gains in Iraq. But the Sunnis of the region will remain in rebellion and the Sunni-dominated areas will remain in turmoil -- chaos that ISIS will be able to capitalize on this chaos. In the long run, ISIS might very well find that its greatest foes lie within its so-called Caliphate. The few reports that are emerging from areas controlled by ISIS suggest that, unsurprisingly, people do not like living under a brutal, theocratic dictatorship. They live in fear, and even those who chose it as an alternative to Shiite rule are growing disenchanted. In this respect, ISIS is like other radical Islamic groups, such as the Taliban -- they have an allure in the abstract, but once they are actually governing in their medieval, barbarous manner, the allure fades and the disenchantment builds. The result is ever-increasing repression. Remember, no one has ever voted ISIS into power anywhere. The group simply slaughters its way to control. Of course, one of the big questions has been: Is ISIS a threat to the West? The group's leaders declare that it is. But their ambitions appear to be mostly centered on their Arab enemies, on building a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. They understand, of course, that to be Terror Group No. 1, they must battle the country that is the world's No. 1 power -- the United States. With that in mind, they seek such a confrontation and hope that the United States will come to the Middle East and fight them on their terms, on their terrain. Still, while they are opportunists, and they ask and hope that their followers act in America, their main focus is not to come here -- they want Americans to go there. Yet no matter how one rates the level of the threat ISIS poses, the group has changed the nature of terror. The leaders of ISIS have recognized that above all, they are a messaging machine, which in turn becomes a recruitment machine. This means that the key is not what happens on the ground, but on the airwaves and in the bits and bytes of the Internet. And ISIS does this better than anyone before them because while their gruesome videos would seem a repulsive turn-off -- and are to most -- they still work on the web. The shock and awe they produce makes them go viral, and thus are seen by tens of millions. That ensures that these videos attract those utterly alienated young men -- a few thousand among the world's 1.6 billion Muslims -- who seek revenge, glory and gore.

Ariana Miyamoto says it was often punishing growing up as the only black girl in her class in the port town of Sasebo near Nagasaki, where the US has a naval base and where her African-American father met her Japanese mother. The 20-year-old  was born and raised in Japan, speaks fluent Japanese, and was last month chosen to represent her country in the Miss Universe pageant. Scroll down for video . Ariana Miyamoto, 20, was crowned Miss Japan last month, but has faced\u00a0horrific racial abuse growing up . Ariana with her father Bryant Stanfield and a step sibling (left). As a youngster (right) she grew up in Japan . Some critics of Ariana's win have complained she is a mixed race 'hafu' and not Japanese enough . But the beauty queen had to use her first television appearance after her selection to apologetically explain to reporters that while she doesn't 'look Japanese' on the outside, on the inside there are 'many Japanese things about her'. Many in the country have expressed hostility to Ariana's title win as they expected the award to go to a 'pure' Japanese woman and not a 'hafu', meaning half Japanese, which has echoes of the discredited term 'half-caste'. 'Is it okay to choose a hafu to represent Japan?' one commenter typically wrote online after Ariana's win. Speaking about her childhood in an interview with MailOnline Ariana, who goes by her mother's maiden name, said: 'There was pretty much a spasmodic vomit of racial abuse heaped upon me. 'I was called a n****r by some of my peers. Some of them threw trash and even a blackboard duster at me. 'I'm Japanese through and through, but in Japan if you look \"foreign\" you are often not accepted as Japanese. But I am Japanese - 100 percent. 'Skin colour bears no relationship to what a person is. It's just one of the differences like wearing blue clothes or wearing red clothes.' 'I have no objections against the word 'hafu' and I accept myself as being hafu. 'With so little multi-culturalism in Japan the term is somehow understandable, although it has made me wonder who I am at times.' Ariana has been inspired by American singer Mariah Carey's struggle to get to the top as a mixed race artist, exemplified in her film Glitter, in which she plays a young singer battling discrimination to make it to the top. Ariana with her mother. She says she is 'Japanese through and through. I am Japanese - 100 percent' Ariana will represent Japan at Miss Universe having fought her way to the top despite racial prejudice . The beauty queen grew up in Sasebo near Nagasaki but spent\u00a0two years with her dad in the US as a teenager . From his home in Jacksonville, Arkansas, Ariana's father Bryant Stanfield, 43, said his face hurt from non-stop smiling since his daughter scooped the Miss Japan award from a line up of more 'typical' looking Japanese women earlier this month. But he admits he's been dismayed by some of the racist comments her win has generated in Japan. 'Just get to know her. Just don't attack her. She will represent Japan very well,' he told MailOnline. 'She's told me all about the bullying and how kids used to treat her; how they hated her (wavy) hair; threw things at her; even threw trash at her. 'All pretty despicable stuff. But I always told her, and her Mom said too, 'you gotta be tough'.' Divided from the Asian and Russian land masses by fierce currents, many Japanese have long believed in a myth of racial purity, although the islands' inhabitants are a result of a hodge-podge of different migrations mainly from Korea, China and the south seas. The only 'native Japanese' are the Caucasian-looking Ainu people, pushed to near-extinction to Japan's northernmost reaches. Today, those perceived of belonging outside the mythical Japanese race are regularly discriminated against leading to a type of apartheid, particularly when it comes to renting housing. A recent ruling by Japan's ministry of justice in Kyoto declared that a 'No foreigners allowed' rule by landlords is not in fact discriminatory, thus cementing some of the institutional and casual racism non-Japanese face in contemporary Japan. The Japanese like to think of their society and culture is unique according to Theodore Bestor, a professor of anthropology and Japanese studies at Harvard University which, in a study, put Korea and Japan at the top of racially homogeneous countries, largely unwilling to accept an influx of foreigners. Miss Japan has said there was 'pretty much a spasmodic vomit of racial abuse heaped upon me' growing up . Ariana with her Japanese mother and a male friend. She claims she was called a 'n****r' by her peers . The Miss Universe hopeful with a step sibling. Her father says she is 'proud of both' her heritages . 'One of the ways in which Japanese think of their own society as 'unique' is to emphasise the homogeneity of Japanese society and indeed by lots of comparisons, Japan is certainly a much more homogeneous society than say the United States,' Bestor told Columbia University's Asian Topics. 'And, it's often said by Japanese that they are ethnically homogeneous, that there are no real foreign populations in Japan.' The election of a mixed race Japan is a first for one of the world's most ethnically homogeneous states . The election of a black Miss Japan might be a step away from that misconception and Mr Stanfield agrees that the choice of his daughter represents some kind of progression in  Japan. Conversely, he feels his dark-skinned daughter would fair better in today's America despite some recent headlines created by racial strife in Ferguson. 'It's different in America. Her being what and who she is; there is not a second thought,' he said. In reaction to the racist carping on Japan's social networks since her crowning, he believes some of the received wisdom about 'Japaneseness' might be at fault. 'Some people, for a lack of a better word, some people are ignorant. I'm not saying that the whole of Japan is ignorant but there some people who just don't know,' he said, adding that in his three years in Japan he personally had never experienced any racism. It was an encouraging sign that the Japanese judges picked a mixed race Miss Japan, he agreed, showing the progressive aspects of a country that still has the death penalty and where one tourism minister described his own 'one-race' countrymen as 'not keen' on immigration or foreigners. In contrast, Mr Stanfield said, in terms of race relations the US is a much more rosy place than it once was. 'Things are changing here,' he said, and agreed that the spread of more liberal attitudes towards gay marriage was just one example of how American is more enlightened and 'changing for the better.' 'Its not a rapid change but slowly but surely it's coming around.' 'I have to say what my daughter went through in Japan she would not have experienced in the US. There are always some people here who don't like you because of the way you look or because you are different so I'm proud of her sticking it out in japan and doing what she did - becoming Miss Japan.' As a young man, Miss Japan's father's life reads like that of the American lead in Madame Butterfly, where a handsome naval officer falls in love with a Japanese geisha before finally leaving Japan and his Japanese bride and their daughter behind. He met Ariana's Japanese mother while on duty in the US navy at Nagasaki in the 90s. 'We moved stateside for a little while but her mother actually wanted Ariana to be born in Japan,' he said. Ariana's father Bryant Stanfield, 43, says people in Japen will 'never be as proud of her as I am' 'After that my duties meant I couldn't be in Japan for any length of time and slowly her mother and I drifted apart. There's no bad history. Her mother and I just went our separate ways.' Not until Ariana was a teenager did she renew her bond with her father. After Mr Stanfield remarried and had three more children, they were joined by Ariana more permanently three years ago when Ariana stayed in Arkansas for two years to learn English and attend US high school. English is not widely spoken in Japan despite Herculean education efforts to teach it. After returning from the US, Ariana started a career in modelling in Japan. It is a pastime often considered too 'showbiz' by a traditionally-minded country, and one where beautiful half-Japanese 'hafu' offspring dominate. Ariana's father is in little doubt she is proud of both heritages. 'She's fully aware of who she is and she's fully aware of where she comes from. 'She's aware of both sides - the black side and the Japanese side,' he said. 'She just wants everyone to get along and accept one another for what they are not because of the colour of their skin, but for who they are as a person. 'Please tell Japan to just accept her, and just be be proud of her. Though I know they will never be as proud of her as I am.'\n"]}

The motoring programme's website previously featured the broadcasting trio alongside The Stig at the top of the page but now the racing driver appears solo in his white helmet. It comes just over a week after the 54-year-old host was sacked from the BBC for an 'unprovoked' attack on a Top Gear producer. Scroll down for video . Change: The Top Gear website now features an image of The Stig on his own at the top of the page . Before: The website used to feature an image of all three presenters - Richard Hammond (left), Jeremy Clarkson (centre) and James May (right) as well as racing driver The Stig (far right) The BBC say the masthead change is to 'simply reflect the fact that all three presenters are currently out of contract on the show'. However the Corporation is yet to confirm whether Hammond, known as 'The Hamster', and May, who is dubbed 'Captain Slow', will return to the popular show. Both have recently changed their Twitter bios too, with Hammond saying: 'Can't explain it really ... er, I do this car show and stuff.' While May's profile reads: 'Former TV presenter only remembered for saying \"Oh c***\". Or was that the other bloke?' The pair also revealed today that they are selling off a dozen bikes from the classic motor cycle collections - raising more questions about the future of their employment. May is putting eight of his two-wheeled treasures under the hammer, while Hammond, is doing the same with four of his. The BBC say the website change is to reflect the fact that none of the presenters are currently in contract . Together the 12 bikes are estimated to be worth a guide price of \u00a366,000 and are being sold off by auctioneers Bonhams later this month. The Top Gear duo\u2019s bikes are being sold off by auctioneers Bonhams at their Spring Stafford Sale later this month. May insisted the decision to sell the bikes came before the latest BBC Top Gear turmoil, saying: \u2019Just because I\u2019m unemployed now doesn\u2019t mean I have to get rid of everything. \u2018I was going to sell these bikes anyway. And those paintings, and my collection of Scalextric cars. Honest\u2019. Hammond added: \u2018As a serious collector of motorcycles, it\u2019s important to review one\u2019s stable regularly, and the Bonhams Stafford sale is the ideal opportunity to move bikes on and possibly acquire new ones. Hammond and May also revealed they are selling off a dozen bikes from the classic motor cycle collections . The BBC confirmed they will fulfil the Top \u00a0Gear live gigs, but they will be stripped of the Corporation's branding .

They will do a series of gigs, which have already sold 200,000 tickets worldwide and made \u00a310million, but the show will be stripped entirely of all BBC branding. Clarkson was sacked from Top Gear on March 25 after it was found that he had punched producer Oisin Tymon in a 30-second assault, leaving him with a split lip and needing hospital treatment. The BBC announced 'a line has been crossed' and 'there cannot be one rule for one and one rule for another' following the suspension.
