# 🚀 nano-PEARL

> **A lightweight parallel speculative decoding implementation in nano-vllm style**

nano-PEARL is a single-node, multi-GPU parallel speculative decoding engine. It decouples Draft and Target models onto separate device groups and runs them concurrently with on-the-fly verification, prefix KV caching, CUDA Graphs, and tensor parallelism — aiming for high throughput without sacrificing output quality.

## 🎉 Latest News

🚧 **Coming Soon**: More updates and features are in development!

- [2025.10] 🔥 We release the source code of nano-PEARL. Any PR is warmly welcomed!

## 📦 Installation

Our nano-PEARL is built based on [nano-vllm](https://github.com/GeeeekExplorer/nano-vllm), and the installation is almost same with nano-vllm (only need to additionally install `rich` for colorful log). 🎨


First create an environment with `python>=3.12`:
```shell
conda create -n nano-pearl python=3.12 -y
conda activate nano-pearl
```

Then, install packages with `uv` or `pip`:

**From source:**
```shell
uv pip install -e . # from current path
```

**From GitHub:**
```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/smart-lty/nano-PEARL.git # from github
```
⚠️ When you directly use pip for installation, you may encounter that build flash-attn needs torch installed. In this case, you should **install torch first**, and then re-run the installation command.

⚠️ If the installation of flash-attn is very slow, we strongly recommend you to download a whl file and **build flash attn from wheel**.


## ✨ Key Features

- 🔄 **Draft-Target Disaggregation**: The draft model and the target model are loaded in separate devices, avoiding load-imbalance and resource competition.
- ⚡ **Parallel Inference**: Both the draft model and the target model run inference in parallel, fully exploiting the GPU utilization!
- 🎯 **Adaptive Draft Length**: 
  - When the alignment is good, the draft model could generate draft tokens without being interrupted by the target model.
  - When the alignment is poor, the target model could prevent the draft model from generating trash draft tokens.
- 🤖 **Auto-Set Hyper-parameters**: Automatically configure optimal parameters for your hardware setup.
- 🚀 **High Performance**: Built on CUDA Graphs and tensor parallelism for maximum throughput.
- 💾 **Memory Efficient**: Prefix KV caching reduces memory usage while maintaining performance.

## 🚀 Quick Start

The `nano-PEARL` API mirrors `vLLM` / `nano-vllm`'s interface. The main difference is in the `LLM` engine initialization, where you must **specify both a target model and a draft model**, along with their respective tensor-parallel (TP) sizes.

See `example.py` for usage: a minimal example of running parallel speculative decoding on 2 GPUs (e.g., 1 for the target model, 1 for the draft model):

```python
from nano_pearl import PEARLConfig, PEARLEngine, SamplingParams, logger

def main():
    draft_model_path = "/path/to/draft/model"
    target_model_path = "/path/to/target/model"
    
    config = PEARLConfig(draft_model_path, target_model_path, draft_tensor_parallel_size=1, target_tensor_parallel_size=1, gpu_memory_utilization=0.9)
    engine = PEARLEngine(config)
    
    prompt = "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
    sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.0, max_tokens=256, ignore_eos=False)
    engine.add_request(prompt, sampling_params)
    
    output_text, num_tokens, num_acc_tokens, elapsed_time = engine.generate()
```

## 📊 BenchMark Results

Coming Soon!

## 📋 TODOs

- [ ]  **Dynamic TP Size**: Support dynamic TP size, including TP=6/7, hence the 8 GPUs can be fully used!
- [ ]  **Draft Model Temperature**: Support setting a non-zero temperature for the draft model.
- [ ]  **Continuous Batching**: Support continuous batching and chunked prefill.
- [ ]  **PEARL-2**: Support fine-tuning / distilling a PEARL-specific draft model for further acceleration.

## 🐛 Bug Fixing
Coming Soon!
